fortune which call independent though most of my friends be incline to smile when say so in short be now master of near a thousand pound have always entertain a notion that my want of success in publish the treatise of human nature have proceed more from the manner than the matter and that have be guilty of a very usual indiscretion in go to the press too early therefore cast the first part of that work anew in the enquiry concern human understand which be publish while be at turin but this piece be at first little more successful than the treatise of human nature on my return from italy have the mortification to find all england in a ferment on account of dr middletons free enquiry while my performance be entirely overlook and neglect a new edition which have be publish at london of

my brother at his countryhouse for my mother be now dead there compose the second part of my essay which call political discourse and also my enquiry concern the principles of morals which be another part of my treatise that cast anew meanwhile my bookseller a millar inform me that my former publications all but the unfortunate treatise be begin to be the subject of conversation that the sale of them be gradually increase and that new editions be demand answer by reverends and right reverends come out two or three in a year and find by dr warburtons rail that the book be begin to be esteem in good company however have fix a resolution which inflexibly maintain never to reply to any body and not be very irascible in my temper have easily keep myself clear of all literary squabble these symptoms of a rise reputation give me encouragement as be ever more dispose to see the favourable than unfavourable side of things a turn of mind which it be more happy to possess than to be bear to an estate of ten thousand a year in remove from the country to the town the true scene for a man of letter in be publish at edinburgh where then live my political discourse the only work of mine that be successful on the first publication it be well receive abroad and at home in the same year be publish at london my enquiry concern the principles of morals which in my own opinion who ought not to judge on that subject be of all my write historical philosophical or literary incomparably the best it come unnoticed and unobserved into the world in the faculty of advocate choose me their librarian an office from which receive little or no emolument but which give me the command of a large library then form the plan of write the history of england but be frighten with the notion of continue a narrative through a period of years commence with the accession of the house of stuart an epoch when think the misrepresentations of faction begin chiefly to take place be own sanguine in my expectations of the success of this work think that be the only historian that have at once neglect present power interest and authority and the cry of popular prejudice and as the subject be suit to every capacity expect proportional applause but miserable be my disappointment be assail by one cry of reproach disapprobation and even detestation english scotch and irish whig and tory churchman and sectary freethinker and religionist patriot and courtier unite in their rage against the man who have presume to shed a generous tear for the fate of charles and the earl of strafford and after the first ebullitions of their fury be over what be still more mortify the book seem to sink into oblivion mr millar tell me that in a twelvemonth he sell only fortyfive copy of it scarcely indeed hear of one man in the three kingdoms considerable for rank or letter that could endure the book must only except the primate of england dr herring and the primate of ireland dr stone which seem two odd exceptions these dignify prelates separately send me message not to be discourage be however confess discourage and have not the war be at that time break out between france and england have certainly retire to some provincial town of the former kingdom have change my name and never more have return to my native country but as this scheme be not now practicable and the subsequent volume be considerably advance resolve to pick up courage and to persevere in this interval publish at london my natural history of religion along with some other small piece its public entry be rather obscure except only that dr hurd write a pamphlet against it with all the illiberal petulance arrogance and scurrility which distinguish the warburtonian school this pamphlet give me some consolation for the otherwise indifferent reception of my performance in two years after the fall of the first volume be publish the second volume of my history contain the period from the death of charles till the revolution this performance happen to give less displeasure to the whigs and be better receive it not only rise itself but help to buoy up its unfortunate brother but though have be teach by experience that the whig party be in possession of bestow all place both in the state and in literature be so little incline to yield to their senseless clamour that in above a hundred alterations which farther study read or reflection engage me to make in the reign of the two first stuarts have make all of them invariably to the tory side it be ridiculous to consider the english constitution before that period as a regular plan of liberty in publish my history of the house of tudor the clamour against this performance be almost equal to that against the history of the two first stuarts the reign of elizabeth be particularly obnoxious but be now callous against the impressions of public folly and continue very peaceably and contentedly in my retreat at edinburgh to finish in two volumes the more early part of the english history which give to the public in with tolerable and but tolerable success but notwithstanding this variety of wind and season to which my write have be expose they have still be make such advance that the copymoney give me by the booksellers much exceed any thing formerly know in england be become not only independent but opulent retire to my native country of scotland determine never more to set my foot out of it and retain the satisfaction of never have prefer a request to one great man or even make advance of friendship to any of them as be now turn of fifty think of pass all the rest of my life in this philosophical manner when receive in an invitation from the earl of hertford with whom be not in the least acquaint to attend him on his embassy to paris with a near prospect of be appoint secretary to the embassy and in the meanwhile of perform the function of that office this offer however invite at first decline both because be reluctant to begin connexions with the great and because be afraid that the civilities and gay company of paris would prove disagreeable to a person of my age and humour but on his lordships repeat the invitation accept of it have every reason both of pleasure and interest to think myself happy in my connexions with that nobleman as well as afterwards with his brother general conway those who have not see the strange effect of modes will never imagine the reception meet with at paris from men and women of all rank and station the more resile from their excessive civilities the more be load with them there be however a real satisfaction in live at paris from the great number of sensible know and polite company with which that city abound above all place in the universe think once of settle there for life be appoint secretary to the embassy and in summer lord hertford leave me be appoint lord lieutenant of ireland be chargé daffaires till the arrival of the duke of richmond towards the end of the year in the begin of leave paris and next summer go to edinburgh with the same view as formerly of bury myself in a philosophical retreat return to that place not richer but with much more money and a much larger income by mean of lord hertfords friendship than leave it and be desirous of try what superfluity could produce as have formerly make an experiment of a competency but in receive from mr conway an invitation to be undersecretary and this invitation both the character of the person and my connexions with lord hertford prevent me from decline return to edinburgh in very opulent for possess a revenue of l a year healthy and though somewhat stricken in years with the prospect of enjoy long my ease and of see the increase of my reputation in spring be strike with a disorder in my bowels which at first give me no alarm but have since as apprehend it become mortal and incurable now reckon upon a speedy dissolution have suffer very little pain from my disorder and what be more strange have notwithstanding the great decline of my person never suffer a moments abatement of my spirit insomuch that be to name the period of my life which should most choose to pass over again might be tempt to point to this later period possess the same ardour as ever in study and the same gaiety in company consider besides that a man of sixtyfive by die cut off only a few years of infirmities and though see many symptoms of my literary reputations break out at last with additional lustre know that could have but few years to enjoy it it be difficult to be more detach from life than be at present to conclude historically with my own character be or rather be for that be the style must now use in speak of myself which embolden me the more to speak my sentiments be say a man of mild dispositions of command of temper of an open social and cheerful humour capable of attachment but little susceptible of enmity and of great moderation in all my passions even my love of literary fame my rule passion never sour my temper notwithstanding my frequent disappointments my company be not unacceptable to the young and careless as well as to the studious and literary and as take a particular pleasure in the company of modest women have no reason to be displease with the reception meet with from them in a word though most men any wise eminent have find reason to complain of calumny never be touch or even attack by her baleful tooth and though wantonly expose myself to the rage of both civil and religious factions they seem to be disarm in my behalf of their wonted fury my friends never have occasion to vindicate any one circumstance of my character and conduct not but that the zealots we may well suppose would have be glad to invent and propagate any story to my disadvantage but they could never find any which they think would wear the face of probability can not say there be no vanity in make this funeral oration of myself but hope it be not a misplace one and this be a matter of fact which be easily clear and ascertain april letter from adam smith to william strahan esq kirkaldy fifeshire nov dear sir it be with a real though a very melancholy pleasure that sit down to give you some account of the behaviour of our late excellent friend mr hume during his last illness though in his own judgment his disease be mortal and incurable yet he allow himself to be prevail upon by the entreaty of his friends to try what might be the effect of a long journey a few days before he set out he write that account of his own life which together with his other paper he have leave to your care my account therefore shall begin where his end he set out for london towards the end of april and at morpeth meet with mr john home and myself who have both come down from london on purpose to see him expect to have find him at edinburgh mr home return with him and attend him during the whole of his stay in england with that care and attention which might be expect from a temper so perfectly friendly and affectionate as have write to my mother that she might expect me in scotland be under the necessity of continue my journey his disease seem to yield to exercise and change of air and when he arrive in london he be apparently in much better health than when he leave edinburgh he be advise to go to bath to drink the water which appear for some time to have so good an effect upon him that even he himself begin to entertain what he be not apt to do a better opinion of his own health his symptoms however soon return with their usual violence and from that moment he give up all thoughts of recovery but submit with the utmost cheerfulness and the most perfect complacency and resignation upon his return to edinburgh though he find himself much weaker yet his cheerfulness never abate and he continue to divert himself as usual with correct his own work for a new edition with read book of amusement with the conversation of his friends and sometimes in the even with a party at his favourite game of whist his cheerfulness be so great and his conversation and amusements run so much in their usual strain that notwithstanding all bad symptoms many people could not believe he be die shall tell your friend colonel edmondstone say doctor dundas to him one day that leave you much better and in a fair way of recovery doctor say he as believe you would not chuse to tell any thing but the truth you have better tell him that be die as fast as my enemies if have any could wish and as easily and cheerfully as my best friends could desire colonel edmondstone soon afterwards come to see him and take leave of him and on his way home he could not forbear write him a letter bid him once more an eternal adieu and apply to him as to a die man the beautiful french verse in which the abbé chaulieu in expectation of his own death lament his approach separation from his friend the marquis de la fare mr hum magnanimity and firmness be such that his most affectionate friends know that they hazard nothing in talk or write to him as to a die man and that so far from be hurt by this frankness he be rather please and flatter by it happen to come into his room while he be read this letter which he have just receive and which he immediately show me tell him that though be sensible how very much he be weaken and that appearances be in many respect very bad yet his cheerfulness be still so great the spirit of life seem still to be so very strong in him that could not help entertain some faint hop he answer your hop be groundless an habitual diarrhoea of more than a years stand would be a very bad disease at any age at my age it be a mortal one when lie down in the even feel myself weaker than when rise in the morning and when rise in the morning weaker than when lay down in the even be sensible besides that some of my vital part be affect so that must soon die well say if it must be so you have at least the satisfaction of leave all your friends your brothers family in particular in great prosperity he say that he felt that satisfaction so sensibly that when he be read a few days before lucians dialogues of the dead among all the excuse which be allege to charon for not enter readily into his boat he could not find one that fit him he have no house to finish he have no daughter to provide for he have no enemies upon whom he wish to revenge himself could not well imagine say he what excuse could make to charon in order to obtain a little delay have do every thing of consequence which ever mean to do and could at no time expect to leave my relations and friends in a better situation than that in which be now likely to leave them therefore have all reason to die content he then divert himself with invent several jocular excuse which he suppose he might make to charon and with imagine the very surly answer which it might suit the character of charon to return to them upon further consideration say he think might say to him good charon have be correct my work for a new edition allow me a little time that may see how the public receive the alterations but charon would answer when you have see the effect of these you will be for make other alterations there will be no end of such excuse so honest friend please step into the boat but might still urge have a little patience good charon have be endeavour to open the eye of the public if live a few years longer may have the satisfaction of see the downfal of some of the prevail systems of superstition but charon would then lose all temper and decency you loiter rogue that will not happen these many hundred years do you fancy will grant you a lease for so long a term get into the boat this instant you lazy loiter rogue but though mr hume always talk of his approach dissolution with great cheerfulness he never affect to make any parade of his magnanimity he never mention the subject but when the conversation naturally lead to it and never dwell longer upon it than the course of the conversation happen to require it be a subject indeed which occur pretty frequently in consequence of the inquiries which his friends who come to see him naturally make concern the state of his health the conversation which mention above and which pass on thursday the th of august be the last except one that ever have with him he have now become so very weak that the company of his most intimate friends fatigue him for his cheerfulness be still so great his complaisance and social disposition be still so entire that when any friend be with him he could not help talk more and with greater exertion than suit the weakness of his body at his own desire therefore agree to leave edinburgh where be stay partly upon his account and return to my mother house here at kirkaldy upon condition that he would send for me whenever he wish to see me the physician who saw him most frequently doctor black undertake in the mean time to write me occasionally an account of the state of his health on the d of august the doctor write me the follow letter since my last mr hume have pass his time pretty easily but be much weaker he sit up go down stairs once a day and amuse himself with read but seldom see any body he find that even the conversation of his most intimate friends fatigue and oppress him and it be happy that he do not need it for he be quite free from anxiety impatience or low spirit and pass his time very well with the assistance of amuse book receive the day after a letter from mr hume himself of which the follow be an extract edinburgh d august my dearest friend be oblige to make use of my nephews hand in write to you as do not rise today go very fast to decline and last night have a small fever which hop might put a quicker period to this tedious illness but unluckily it have in a great measure go off can not submit to your come over here on my account as it be possible for me to see you so small a part of the day but doctor black can better inform you concern the degree of strength which may from time to time remain with me adieu c three days after receive the follow letter from doctor black edinburgh monday th august dear sir yesterday about four oclock afternoon mr hume expire the near approach of his death become evident in the night between thursday and friday when his disease become excessive and soon weaken him so much that he could no longer rise out of his bed he continue to the last perfectly sensible and free from much pain or feel of distress he never drop the smallest expression of impatience but when he have occasion to speak to the people about him always do it with affection and tenderness think it improper to write to bring you over especially as hear that he have dictate a letter to you desire you not to come when he become very weak it cost him an effort to speak and he die in such a happy composure of mind that nothing could exceed it thus die our most excellent and never to be forget friend concern whose philosophical opinions men will no doubt judge variously every one approve or condemn them accord as they happen to coincide or disagree with his own but concern whose character and conduct there can scarce be a difference of opinion his temper indeed seem to be more happily balance if may be allow such an expression than that perhaps of any other man have ever know even in the lowest state of his fortune his great and necessary frugality never hinder him from exercise upon proper occasion act both of charity and generosity it be a frugality found not upon avarice but upon the love of independency the extreme gentleness of his nature never weaken either the firmness of his mind or the steadiness of his resolutions his constant pleasantry be the genuine effusion of goodnature and goodhumour temper with delicacy and modesty and without even the slightest tincture of malignity so frequently the disagreeable source of what be call wit in other men it never be the mean of his raillery to mortify and therefore far from offend it seldom fail to please and delight even those who be the object of it to his friends who be frequently the object of it there be not perhaps any one of all his great and amiable qualities which contribute more to endear his conversation and that gaiety of temper so agreeable in society but which be so often accompany with frivolous and superficial qualities be in him certainly attend with the most severe application the most extensive learn the greatest depth of think and a capacity in every respect the most comprehensive upon the whole have always consider him both in his lifetime and since his death as approach as nearly to the idea of a perfectly wise and virtuous man as perhaps the nature of human frailty will permit ever be dear sir most affectionately yours adam smith essay and treatises on several subject in two volumes by david hume esq vol contain essay moral political and literary a new edition london print for t cadell in the strand and a donaldson and w creech at edinburgh essay moral political and literary part part essay moral political and literary essay of the delicacy of taste and passion some people be subject to a certain delicacy of passion which make them extremely sensible to all the accidents of life and give them a lively joy upon every prosperous event as well as a pierce grief when they meet with misfortunes and adversity favour and good offices easily engage their friendship while the smallest injury provoke their resentment any honour or mark of distinction elevate them above measure but they be as sensibly touch with contempt people of this character have no doubt more lively enjoyments as well as more pungent sorrow than men of cool and sedate temper but believe when every thing be balance there be no one who would not rather be of the latter character be he entirely master of his own disposition good or ill fortune be very little at our disposal and when a person that have this sensibility of temper meet with any misfortune his sorrow or resentment take entire possession of him and deprive him of all relish in the common occurrences of life the right enjoyment of which form the chief part of our happiness great pleasures be much less frequent than great pain so that a sensible temper must meet with fewer trials in the former way than in the latter not to mention that men of such lively passions be apt to be transport beyond all bound of prudence and discretion and to take false step in the conduct of life which be often irretrievable there be a delicacy of taste observable in some men which very much resemble this delicacy of passion and produce the same sensibility to beauty and deformity of every kind as that do to prosperity and adversity obligations and injuries when you present a poem or a picture to a man possess of this talent the delicacy of his feel make him be sensibly touch with every part of it nor be the masterly stroke perceive with more exquisite relish and satisfaction than the negligences or absurdities with disgust and uneasiness a polite and judicious conversation afford him the highest entertainment rudeness or impertinence be as great a punishment to him in short delicacy of taste have the same effect as delicacy of passion it enlarge the sphere both of our happiness and misery and make us sensible to pain as well as pleasures which escape the rest of mankind believe however every one will agree with me that notwithstanding this resemblance delicacy of taste be as much to be desire and cultivate as delicacy of passion be to be lament and to be remedied if possible the good or ill accidents of life be very little at our disposal but we be pretty much master what book we shall read what diversions we shall partake of and what company we shall keep philosophers have endeavour to render happiness entirely independent of every thing external that degree of perfection be impossible to be attain but every wise man will endeavour to place his happiness on such object chiefly as depend upon himself and that be not to be attain so much by any other mean as by this delicacy of sentiment when a man be possess of that talent he be more happy by what please his taste than by what gratify his appetites and receive more enjoyment from a poem or a piece of reason than the most expensive luxury can afforda whatever connection there may be originally between these two species of delicacy be persuade that nothing be so proper to cure us of this delicacy of passion as the cultivate of that higher and more refine taste which enable us to judge of the character of men of compositions of genius and of the productions of the nobler arts a greater or less relish for those obvious beauties which strike the sense depend entirely upon the greater or less sensibility of the temper but with regard to the sciences and liberal arts a fine taste be in some measure the same with strong sense or at least depend so much upon it that they be inseparable in order to judge aright of a composition of genius there be so many view to be take in so many circumstances to be compare and such a knowledge of human nature requisite that no man who be not possess of the soundest judgment will ever make a tolerable critic in such performances and this be a new reason for cultivate a relish in the liberal arts our judgment will strengthen by this exercise we shall form juster notions of life many things which please or afflict others will appear to us too frivolous to engage our attention and we shall lose by degrees that sensibility and delicacy of passion which be so incommodious but perhaps have go too far in say that a cultivate taste for the polite arts extinguish the passions and render us indifferent to those object which be so fondly pursue by the rest of mankind on farther reflection find that it rather improve our sensibility for all the tender and agreeable passions at the same time that it render the mind incapable of the rougher and more boisterous emotions ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes emollit mores nec sinit esse feros for this think there may be assign two very natural reason in the first place nothing be so improve to the temper as the study of the beauties either of poetry eloquence music or paint they give a certain elegance of sentiment to which the rest of mankind be strangers the emotions which they excite be soft and tender they draw off the mind from the hurry of business and interest cherish reflection dispose to tranquillity and produce an agreeable melancholy which of all dispositions of the mind be the best suit to love and friendship in the second place a delicacy of taste be favourable to love and friendship by confine our choice to few people and make us indifferent to the company and conversation of the greater part of men you will seldom find that mere men of the world whatever strong sense they may be endow with be very nice in distinguish character or in mark those insensible differences and gradations which make one man preferable to another any one that have competent sense be sufficient for their entertainment they talk to him of their pleasure and affairs with the same frankness that they would to another and find many who be fit to supply his place they never feel any vacancy or want in his absence but to make use of the allusion of a celebrate french author the judgment may be compare to a clock or watch where the most ordinary machine be sufficient to tell the hours but the most elaborate alone can point out the minutes and second and distinguish the smallest differences of time one that have well digest his knowledge both of book and men have little enjoyment but in the company of a few select companion he feel too sensibly how much all the rest of mankind fall short of the notions which he have entertain and his affections be thus confine within a narrow circle no wonder he carry them further than if they be more general and undistinguished the gaiety and frolic of a bottle companion improve with him into a solid friendship and the ardours of a youthful appetite become an elegant passion essay of the liberty of the press nothing be more apt to surprise a foreigner than the extreme liberty which we enjoy in this country of communicate whatever we please to the public and of openly censure every measure enter into by the king or his minister if the administration resolve upon war it be affirm that either wilfully or ignorantly they mistake the interest of the nation and that peace in the present situation of affairs be infinitely preferable if the passion of the minister lie towards peace our political writers breathe nothing but war and devastation and represent the pacific conduct of the government as mean and pusillanimous as this liberty be not indulge in any other government either republican or monarchical in holland and venice more than in france or spain it may very naturally give occasion to a question how it happen thatgreat britainalone enjoy this peculiar privilegea the reason why the laws indulge us in such a liberty seem to be derive from our mix form of government which be neither wholly monarchical nor wholly republican it will be find if mistake not a true observation in politics that the two extremes in government liberty and slavery commonly approach nearest to each other and that as you depart from the extremes and mix a little of monarchy with liberty the government become always the more free and on the other hand when you mix a little of liberty with monarchy the yoke become always the more grievous and intolerableb in a government such as that of france which be absolute and where law custom and religion concur all of them to make the people fully satisfy with their condition the monarch can not entertain any jealousy against his subject and therefore be apt to indulge them in great liberties both of speech and action in a government altogether republican such as that of holland where there be no magistrate so eminent as to give jealousy to the state there be no danger in intrust the magistrates with large discretionary power and though many advantage result from such power in preserve peace and order yet they lay a considerable restraint on mens action and make every private citizen pay a great respect to the government thus it seem evident that the two extremes of absolute monarchy and of a republic approach near to each other in some material circumstances in the first the magistrate have no jealousy of the people in the second the people have none of the magistrate which want of jealousy beget a mutual confidence and trust in both case and produce a species of liberty in monarchies and of arbitrary power in republics to justify the other part of the forego observation that in every government the mean be most wide of each other and that the mixtures of monarchy and liberty render the yoke either more easy or more grievous must take notice of a remark in tacitus with regard to the romans under the emperors that they neither could bear total slavery nor total liberty nec totam servitutem nec totam libertatem pati possunt this remark a celebrate poet have translate and apply to the english in his lively description of queen elizabeths policy and government et fit aimer son joug a langlois indompté qui ne peut ni servir ni vivre en liberté henriade liv accord to these remark we be to consider the roman government under the emperors as a mixture of despotism and liberty where the despotism prevail and the english government as a mixture of the same kind where the liberty predominate the consequences be conformable to the forego observation and such as may be expect from those mix form of government which beget a mutual watchfulness and jealousy the roman emperors be many of them the most frightful tyrants that ever disgrace human nature and it be evident that their cruelty be chiefly excite by their jealousy and by their observe that all the great men of rome bore with impatience the dominion of a family which but a little before be no wise superior to their own on the other hand as the republican part of the government prevail in england though with a great mixture of monarchy it be oblige for its own preservation to maintain a watchful jealousy over the magistrates to remove all discretionary power and to secure every ones life and fortune by general and inflexible laws no action must be deem a crime but what the law have plainly determine to be such no crime must be impute to a man but from a legal proof before his judge and even these judge must be his fellowsubjects who be oblige by their own interest to have a watchful eye over the encroachments and violence of the minister from these cause it proceed that there be as much liberty and even perhaps licentiousness in great britain as there be formerly slavery and tyranny in rome these principles account for the great liberty of the press in these kingdoms beyond what be indulge in any other governmentc it be apprehend that arbitrary power would steal in upon us be we not careful to prevent its progress and be there not an easy method of convey the alarm from one end of the kingdom to the other the spirit of the people must frequently be rouzed in order to curb the ambition of the court and the dread of rouzing this spirit must be employ to prevent that ambition nothing so effectual to this purpose as the liberty of the press by which all the learn wit and genius of the nation may be employ on the side of freedom and every one be animate to its defence as long therefore as the republican part of our government can maintain itself against the monarchical it will naturally be careful to keep the press open as of importance to its own preservation it must however be allow that the unbounded liberty of the press though it be difficult perhaps impossible to propose a suitable remedy for it be one of the evils attend those mixt form of governmentd essay that politics may be reduce to a science it be a question with several whether there be any essential difference between one form of government and another and whether every form may not become good or bad accord as it be well or ill administer be it once admit that all governments be alike and that the only difference consist in the character and conduct of the governors most political dispute would be at an end and all zeal for one constitution above another must be esteem mere bigotry and folly but though a friend to moderation can not forbear condemn this sentiment and should be sorry to think that human affairs admit of no greater stability than what they receive from the casual humour and character of particular men it be true those who maintain that the goodness of all government consist in the goodness of the administration may cite many particular instance in history where the very same government in different hand have vary suddenly into the two opposite extremes of good and bad compare the french government under henry and under henry oppression levityartifice on the part of the rulers faction sedition treachery rebellion disloyalty on the part of the subject these compose the character of the former miserable æra but when the patriot and heroic prince who succeed be once firmly seat on the throne the government the people every thing seem to be totally change and all from the difference of the temper and conduct of these two sovereignsa instance of this kind may be multiply almost without number from ancient as well as modern history foreign as well as domestic but here it may be proper to make a distinction all absolute governmentsb must very much depend on the administration and this be one of the great inconvenience attend that form of government but a republican and free government would be an obvious absurdity if the particular check and controuls provide by the constitution have really no influence and make it not the interest even of bad men to act for the public good such be the intention of these form of government and such be their real effect where they be wisely constitute as on the other hand they be the source of all disorder and of the blackest crimes where either skill or honesty have be want in their original frame and institution so great be the force of laws and of particular form of government and so little dependence have they on the humour and temper of men that consequences almost as general and certain may sometimes be deduce from them as any which the mathematical sciences afford us the constitution of the roman republic give the whole legislative power to the people without allow a negative voice either to the nobility or consuls this unbounded power they possess in a collective not in a representative body the consequences be when the people by success and conquest have become very numerous and have spread themselves to a great distance from the capital the citytribes though the most contemptible carry almost every vote they be therefore most cajole by every one that affect popularity they be support in idleness by the general distribution of corn and by particular bribe which they receive from almost every candidate by this mean they become every day more licentious and the campus martius be a perpetual scene of tumult and sedition arm slave be introduce among these rascally citizens so that the whole government fell into anarchy and the greatest happiness which the romans could look for be the despotic power of the cæsars such be the effect of democracy without a representative a nobility may possess the whole or any part of the legislative power of a state in two different ways either every nobleman share the power as part of the whole body or the whole body enjoy the power as compose of part which have each a distinct power and authority the venetian aristocracy be an instance of the first kind of government the polish of the second in the venetian government the whole body of nobility possess the whole power and no nobleman have any authority which he receive not from the whole in the polish government every nobleman by mean of his fiefs have a distinct hereditary authority over his vassals and the whole body have no authority but what it receive from the concurrence of its part the different operations and tendencies of these two species of government might be make apparent even a priori a venetian nobility be preferable to a polish let the humour and education of men be ever so much vary a nobility who possess their power in common will preserve peace and order both among themselves and their subject and no member can have authority enough to controul the laws for a moment the nobles will preserve their authority over the people but without any grievous tyranny or any breach of private property because such a tyrannical government promote not the interest of the whole body however it may that of some individuals there will be a distinction of rank between the nobility and people but this will be the only distinction in the state the whole nobility will form one body and the whole people another without any of those private feud and animosities which spread ruin and desolation every where it be easy to see the disadvantage of a polish nobility in every one of these particulars it be possible so to constitute a free government as that a single person call him doge prince or king shall possess a large share of power and shall form a proper balance or counterpoise to the other part of the legislature this chief magistrate may be either elective or hereditary and though the former institution may to a superficial view appear the most advantageous yet a more accurate inspection will discover in it greater inconveniencies than in the latter and such as be found on cause and principles eternal and immutable the fill of the throne in such a government be a point of too great and too general interest not to divide the whole people into factions whence a civil war the greatest of ills may be apprehend almost with certainty upon every vacancy the prince elect must be either a foreigner or a native the former will be ignorant of the people whom he be to govern suspicious of his new subject and suspect by them give his confidence entirely to strangers who will have no other care but of enrich themselves in the quickest manner while their master favour and authority be able to support them a native will carry into the throne all his private animosities and friendships and will never be view in his elevation without excite the sentiment of envy in those who formerly consider him as their equal not to mention that a crown be too high a reward ever to be give to merit alone and will always induce the candidates to employ force or money or intrigue to procure the vote of the electors so that such an election will give no better chance for superior merit in the prince than if the state have trust to birth alone for determine their sovereign it may therefore be pronounce as an universal axiom in politics that an hereditary prince a nobility without vassals and a people vote by their representatives form the bestmonarchy aristocracy anddemocracy but in order to prove more fully that politics admit of general truths which be invariable by the humour or education either of subject or sovereign it may not be amiss to observe some other principles of this science which may seem to deserve that character it may easily be observe that though free governments have be commonly the most happy for those who partake of their freedom yet be they the most ruinous and oppressive to their provinces and this observation may believe be fix as a maxim of the kind we be here speak of when a monarch extend his dominions by conquest he soon learn to consider his old and his new subject as on the same foot because in reality all his subject be to him the same except the few friends and favourites with whom he be personally acquaint he do not therefore make any distinction between them in his general laws and at the same time be careful to prevent all particular act of oppression on the one as well as on the other but a free state necessarily make a great distinction and must always do so till men learn to love their neighbour as well as themselves the conquerors in such a government be all legislators and will be sure to contrive matter by restrictions on trade and by tax so as to draw some private as well as public advantage from their conquests provincial governors have also a better chance in a republic to escape with their plunder by mean of bribery or intrigue and their fellowcitizens who find their own state to be enrich by the spoil of the subject provinces will be the more incline to tolerate such abuse not to mention that it be a necessary precaution in a free state to change the governors frequently which oblige these temporary tyrants to be more expeditious and rapacious that they may accumulate sufficient wealth before they give place to their successors what cruel tyrants be the romans over the world during the time of their commonwealth it be true they have laws to prevent oppression in their provincial magistrates but cicero inform us that the romans could not better consult the interest of the provinces than by repeal these very laws for in that case say he our magistrates have entire impunity would plunder no more than would satisfy their own rapaciousness whereas at present they must also satisfy that of their judge and of all the great men in rome of whose protection they stand in need who can read of the cruelties and oppressions of verres without horror and astonishment and who be not touch with indignation to hear that after cicero have exhaust on that abandon criminal all the thunder of his eloquence and have prevail so far as to get him condemn to the utmost extent of the laws yet that cruel tyrant live peaceably to old age in opulence and ease and thirty years afterwards be put into the proscription by mark anthony on account of his exorbitant wealth where he fell with cicero himself and all the most virtuous men of rome after the dissolution of the commonwealth the roman yoke become easier upon the provinces as tacitus inform us and it may be observe that many of the worst emperors domitian for instance be careful to prevent all oppression on the provinces intiberiuss time gaul be esteem richer than italy itself nor do find during the whole time of the roman monarchy that the empire become less rich or populous in any of its provinces though indeed its valour and military discipline be always upon the decline the oppression and tyranny of the carthaginians over their subject state in africa go so far as we learn from polybius that not content with exact the half of all the produce of the land which of itself be a very high rent they also load them with many other taxesd if we pass from ancient to modern time we shall still find the observation to hold the provinces of absolute monarchies be always better treat than those of free state compare the païs conquis of france with ireland and you will be convince of this truth though this latter kingdom be in a good measure people from england possess so many right and privilege as should naturally make it challenge better treatment than that of a conquer province corsica be also an obvious instance to the same purpose there be an observation in machiavel with regard to the conquests of alexander the great which think may be regard as one of those eternal political truths which no time nor accidents can vary it may seem strange say that politician that such sudden conquests as those of alexander should be possess so peaceably by his successors and that the persians during all the confusions and civil war among the greeks never make the smallest effort towards the recovery of their former independent government to satisfy us concern the cause of this remarkable event we may consider that a monarch may govern his subject in two different ways he may either follow the maxims of the eastern princes and stretch his authority so far as to leave no distinction of rank among his subject but what proceed immediately from himself no advantage of birth no hereditary honour and possessions and in a word no credit among the people except from his commission alone or a monarch may exert his power after a milder manner like other european princes and leave other source of honour beside his smile and favour birth title possessions valour integrity knowledge or great and fortunate atchievements in the former species of government after a conquest it be impossible ever to shake off the yoke since no one possess among the people so much personal credit and authority as to begin such an enterprize whereas in the latter the least misfortune or discord among the victors will encourage the vanquish to take arm who have leaders ready to prompt and conduct them in every undertake such be the reason of machiavel which seem solid and conclusive though wish he have not mix falsehood with truth in assert that monarchies govern accord to eastern policy though more easily keep when once subdue yet be the most difficult to subdue since they can not contain any powerful subject whose discontent and faction may facilitate the enterprizes of an enemy for besides that such a tyrannical government enervate the courage of men and render them indifferent towards the fortunes of their sovereign besides this say we find by experience that even the temporary and delegate authority of the general and magistrates be always in such governments as absolute within its sphere as that of the prince himself be able with barbarians accustom to a blind submission to produce the most dangerous and fatal revolutions so that in every respect a gentle government be preferable and give the greatest security to the sovereign as well as to the subject legislators therefore ought not to trust the future government of a state entirely to chance but ought to provide a system of laws to regulate the administration of public affairs to the latest posterity effect will always correspond to cause and wise regulations in any commonwealth be the most valuable legacy that can be leave to future age in the smallest court or office the state form and methods by which business must be conduct be find to be a considerable check on the natural depravity of mankind why should not the case be the same in public affairs can we ascribe the stability and wisdom of the venetian government through so many age to any thing but the form of government and be it not easy to point out those defect in the original constitution which produce the tumultuous governments of athens and rome and end at last in the ruin of these two famous republics and so little dependance have this affair on the humour and education of particular men that one part of the same republic may be wisely conduct and another weakly by the very same men merely on account of the difference of the form and institutions by which these part be regulate historians inform us that this be actually the case with genoa for while the state be always full of sedition and tumult and disorder the bank of st george which have become a considerable part of the people be conduct for several age with the utmost integrity and wisdom the age of greatest public spirit be not always most eminent for private virtue good laws may beget order and moderation in the government where the manners and customs have instill little humanity or justice into the temper of men the most illustrious period of the roman history consider in a political view be that between the begin of the first and end of the last punic war the due balance between the nobility and the people be then fix by the contest of the tribunes and not be yet lose by the extent of conquests yet at this very time the horrid practice of poison be so common that during part of a season a prætor punish capitally for this crime above three thousand persons in a part of italy and find informations of this nature still multiply upon him there be a similar or rather a worse instance in the more early time of the commonwealth so deprave in private life be that people whom in their histories we so much admire doubt not but they be really more virtuous during the time of the two triumvirates when they be tear their common country to piece and spread slaughter and desolation over the face of the earth merely for the choice of tyrants f here then be a sufficient inducement to maintain with the utmost zeal in every free state those form and institutions by which liberty be secure the public good consult and the avarice or ambition of particular men restrain and punish nothing do more honour to human nature than to see it susceptible of so noble a passion as nothing can be a greater indication of meanness of heart in any man than to see him destitute of it a man who love only himself without regard to friendship and desert merit the severest blame and a man who be only susceptible of friendship without public spirit or a regard to the community be deficient in the most material part of virtue but this be a subject which need not be longer insist on at present there be enow of zealots on both side who kindle up the passions of their partizans and under pretence of public good pursue the interest and end of their particular faction for my part shall always be more fond of promote moderation than zeal though perhaps the surest way of produce moderation in every party be to increase our zeal for the public let us therefore try if it be possible from the forego doctrine to draw a lesson of moderation with regard to the party into which our country be at presentg divide at the same time that we allow not this moderation to abate the industry and passion with which every individual be bind to pursue the good of his country those who either attack or defend a minister in such a government as ours where the utmost liberty be allow always carry matter to an extreme and exaggerate his merit or demerit with regard to the public his enemies be sure to charge him with the greatest enormities both in domestic and foreign management and there be no meanness or crime of which in their account he be not capable unnecessary war scandalous treaties profusion of public treasure oppressive tax every kind of maladministration be ascribe to him to aggravate the charge his pernicious conduct it be say will extend its baleful influence even to posterity by undermine the best constitution in the world and disorder that wise system of laws institutions and customs by which our ancestors during so many centuries have be so happily govern he be not only a wicked minister in himself but have remove every security provide against wicked minister for the future on the other hand the partizans of the minister make his panegyric run as high as the accusation against him and celebrate his wise steady and moderate conduct in every part of his administration the honour and interest of the nation support abroad public credit maintain at home persecution restrain faction subdue the merit of all these bless be ascribe solely to the minister at the same time he crown all his other merit by a religious care of the best constitution in the world which he have preserve in all its part and have transmit entire to be the happiness and security of the latest posterity when this accusation and panegyric be receive by the partizans of each party no wonder they beget an extraordinary ferment on both side and fill the nation with violent animosities but would fain persuade these partyzealots that there be a flat contradiction both in the accusation and panegyric and that it be impossible for either of them to run so high be it not for this contradiction if our constitution be really that noble fabric the pride ofbritain the envy of our neighbour raise by the labour of so many centuries repair at the expence of so many millions and cement by such a profusion of blood say if our constitution do in any degree deserve these eulogiesh it would never have suffer a wicked and weak minister to govern triumphantly for a course of twenty years when oppose by the greatest geniuses in the nation who exercise the utmost liberty of tongue and pen in parliament and in their frequent appeal to the people but if the minister be wicked and weak to the degree so strenuously insist on the constitution must be faulty in its original principles and he can not consistently be charge with undermine the best form of government in the world a constitution be only so far good as it provide a remedy against maladministration and if the british when in its greatest vigour and repair by two such remarkable events as the revolution and accession by which our ancient royal family be sacrifice to it if our constitution say with so great advantage do not in fact provide any such remedy we be rather behold to any minister who undermine it and afford us an opportunity of erect a better in its place would employ the same topics to moderate the zeal of those who defend the minister be our constitution so excellent then a change of ministry can be no such dreadful event since it be essential to such a constitution in every ministry both to preserve itself from violation and to prevent all enormities in the administration be our constitution very bad then so extraordinary a jealousy and apprehension on account of change be ill place and a man should no more be anxious in this case than a husband who have marry a woman from the stew should be watchful to prevent her infidelity public affairs in such a government must necessarily go to confusion by whatever hand they be conduct and the zeal of patriots be in that case much less requisite than the patience and submission of philosophers the virtue and good intentions of cato and brutus be highly laudable but to what purpose do their zeal serve only to hasten the fatal period of the roman government and render its convulsions and die agonies more violent and painful would not be understand to mean that public affairs deserve no care and attention at all would men be moderate and consistent their claim might be admit at least might be examine the countryparty might still assert that our constitution though excellent will admit of maladministration to a certain degree and therefore if the minister be bad it be proper to oppose him with a suitable degree of zeal and on the other hand the courtparty may be allow upon the supposition that the minister be good to defend and with some zeal too his administration would only persuade men not to contend as if they be fight pro aris focis and change a good constitution into a bad one by the violence of their factionsi have not here consider any thing that be personal in the present controversy in the best civil constitution where every man be restrain by the most rigid laws it be easy to discover either the good or bad intentions of a minister and to judge whether his personal character deserve love or hatred but such question be of little importance to the public and lay those who employ their pen upon them under a just suspicion either of malevolence or of flattery essay of the first principles of government nothing appear more surprizing to those who consider human affairs with a philosophical eye than the easiness with which the many be govern by the few and the implicit submission with which men resign their own sentiments and passions to those of their rulers when we enquire by what mean this wonder be effect we shall find that as force be always on the side of the govern the governors have nothing to support them but opinion it be therefore on opinion only that government be found and this maxim extend to the most despotic and most military governments as well as to the most free and most popular the soldan of egypt or the emperor of rome might drive his harmless subject like brute beasts against their sentiments and inclination but he must at least have lead his mamalukes or prætorian band like men by their opinion opinion be of two kinds to wit opinion of interest and opinion of right by opinion of interest chiefly understand the sense of the general advantage which be reap from government together with the persuasion that the particular government which be establish be equally advantageous with any other that could easily be settle when this opinion prevail among the generality of a state or among those who have the force in their hand it give great security to any government right be of two kinds right to power and right to property what prevalence opinion of the first kind have over mankind may easily be understand by observe the attachment which all nations have to their ancient government and even to those name which have have the sanction of antiquity antiquity always beget the opinion of right and whatever disadvantageous sentiments we may entertain of mankind they be always find to be prodigal both of blood and treasure in the maintenance of public justicea there be indeed no particular in which at first sight there may appear a greater contradiction in the frame of the human mind than the present when men act in a faction they be apt without shame or remorse to neglect all the tie of honour and morality in order to serve their party and yet when a faction be form upon a point of right or principle there be no occasion where men discover a greater obstinacy and a more determine sense of justice and equity the same social disposition of mankind be the cause of these contradictory appearances it be sufficiently understand that the opinion of right to property be of moment in all matter of government a note author have make property the foundation of all government and most of our political writers seem incline to follow him in that particular this be carry the matter too far but still it must be own that the opinion of right to property have a great influence in this subject upon these three opinions therefore of public interest of right to power and of right to property be all governments found and all authority of the few over the many there be indeed other principles which add force to these and determine limit or alter their operation such as selfinterestfear and affection but still we may assert that these other principles can have no influence alone but suppose the antecedent influence of those opinions abovementioned they be therefore to be esteem the secondary not the original principles of government for first as to selfinterest by which mean the expectation of particular reward distinct from the general protection which we receive from government it be evident that the magistrates authority must be antecedently establish at least be hop for in order to produce this expectation the prospect of reward may augment his authority with regard to some particular persons but can never give birth to it with regard to the public men naturally look for the greatest favour from their friends and acquaintance and therefore the hop of any considerable number of the state would never center in any particular set of men if these men have no other title to magistracy and have no separate influence over the opinions of mankind the same observation may be extend to the other two principles of fear and affection no man would have any reason to fear the fury of a tyrant if he have no authority over any but from fear since as a single man his bodily force can reach but a small way and all the farther power he possess must be found either on our own opinion or on the presume opinion of others and though affection to wisdom and virtue in a sovereign extend very far and have great influence yet he must antecedently be suppose invest with a public character otherwise the public esteem will serve him in no stead nor will his virtue have any influence beyond a narrow sphere a government may endure for several age though the balance of power and the balance of property do not coincide this chiefly happen where any rank or order of the state have acquire a large share in the property but from the original constitution of the government have no share in the power under what pretence would any individual of that order assume authority in public affairs as men be commonly much attach to their ancient government it be not to be expect that the public would ever favour such usurpations but where the original constitution allow any share of power though small to an order of men who possess a large share of the property it be easy for them gradually to stretch their authority and bring the balance of power to coincide with that of property this have be the case with the house of commons in england most writers that have treat of the british government have suppose that as the lower house represent all the commons of great britain its weight in the scale be proportion to the property and power of all whom it represent but this principle must not be receive as absolutely true for though the people be apt to attach themselves more to the house of commons than to any other member of the constitution that house be choose by them as their representatives and as the public guardians of their liberty yet be there instance where the house even when in opposition to the crown have not be follow by the people as we may particularly observe of the tory house of commons in the reign of king william be the members oblige to receive instructions from their constituents like the dutch deputies this would entirely alter the case and if such immense power and riches as those of all the commons of great britain be bring into the scale it be not easy to conceive that the crown could either influence that multitude of people or withstand that overbalance of property it be true the crown have great influence over the collective body in the elections of members but be this influence which at present be only exert once in seven years to be employ in bring over the people to every vote it would soon be waste and no skill popularity or revenue could support it must therefore be of opinion that an alteration in this particular would introduce a total alteration in our government and would soon reduce it to a pure republic and perhaps to a republic of no inconvenient form for though the people collect in a body like the roman tribes be quite unfit for government yet when disperse in small body they be more susceptible both of reason and order the force of popular currents and tide be in a great measure break and the public interest may be pursue with some method and constancy but it be needle to reason any farther concern a form of government which be never likely to have place in great britain and which seem not to be the aim of any party amongst us let us cherish and improve our ancient government as much as possible without encourage a passion for such dangerous noveltiesb essay of the origin of government man bear in a family be compel to maintain society from necessity from natural inclination and from habit the same creature in his farther progress be engage to establish political society in order to administer justice without which there can be no peace among them nor safety nor mutual intercourse we be therefore to look upon all the vast apparatus of our government as have ultimately no other object or purpose but the distribution of justice or in other word the support of the twelve judge kings and parliaments fleet and armies officer of the court and revenue ambassadors minister and privycounsellors be all subordinate in their end to this part of administration even the clergy as their duty lead them to inculcate morality may justly be think so far as regard this world to have no other useful object of their institution all men be sensible of the necessity of justice to maintain peace and order and all men be sensible of the necessity of peace and order for the maintenance of society yet notwithstanding this strong and obvious necessity such be the frailty or perverseness of our nature it be impossible to keep men faithfully and unerringly in the paths of justice some extraordinary circumstances may happen in which a man find his interest to be more promote by fraud or rapine than hurt by the breach which his injustice make in the social union but much more frequently he be seduce from his great and important but distant interest by the allurement of present though often very frivolous temptations this great weakness be incurable in human nature men must therefore endeavour to palliate what they can not cure they must institute some persons under the appellation of magistrates whose peculiar office it be to point out the decree of equity to punish transgressors to correct fraud and violence and to oblige men however reluctant to consult their own real and permanent interest in a word obedience be a new duty which must be invent to support that of justice and the tyes of equity must be corroborate by those of allegiance but still view matter in an abstract light it may be think that nothing be gain by this alliance and that the factitious duty of obedience from its very nature lay as feeble a hold of the human mind as the primitive and natural duty of justice peculiar interest and present temptations may overcome the one as well as the other they be equally expose to the same inconvenience and the man who be incline to be a bad neighbour must be lead by the same motives well or ill understand to be a bad citizen and subject not to mention that the magistrate himself may often be negligent or partial or unjust in his administration experience however prove that there be a great difference between the case order in society we find be much better maintain by mean of government and our duty to the magistrate be more strictly guard by the principles of human nature than our duty to our fellowcitizens the love of dominion be so strong in the breast of man that many not only submit to but court all the dangers and fatigue and care of government and men once raise to that station though often lead astray by private passions find in ordinary case a visible interest in the impartial administration of justice the persons who first attain this distinction by the consent tacit or express of the people must be endow with superior personal qualities of valour force integrity or prudence which command respect and confidence and after government be establish a regard to birth rank and station have a mighty influence over men and enforce the decree of the magistrate the prince or leader exclaim against every disorder which disturb his society he summon all his partizans and all men of probity to aid him in correct and redress it and he be readily follow by all indifferent persons in the execution of his office he soon acquire the power of reward these service and in the progress of society he establish subordinate minister and often a military force who find an immediate and a visible interest in support his authority habit soon consolidate what other principles of human nature have imperfectly found and men once accustom to obedience never think of depart from that path in which they and their ancestors have constantly tread and to which they be confine by so many urgent and visible motives but though this progress of human affairs may appear certain and inevitable and though the support which allegiance bring to justice be found on obvious principles of human nature it can not be expect that men should beforehand be able to discover them or foresee their operation government commence more casually and more imperfectly it be probable that the first ascendant of one man over multitudes begin during a state of war where the superiority of courage and of genius discover itself most visibly where unanimity and concert be most requisite and where the pernicious effect of disorder be most sensibly felt the long continuance of that state an incident common among savage tribes enured the people to submission and if the chieftain possess as much equity as prudence and valour he become even during peace the arbiter of all differences and could gradually by a mixture of force and consent establish his authority the benefit sensibly felt from his influence make it be cherish by the people at least by the peaceable and well dispose among them and if his son enjoy the same good qualities government advance the sooner to maturity and perfection but be still in a feeble state till the farther progress of improvement procure the magistrate a revenue and enable him to bestow reward on the several instrument of his administration and to inflict punishments on the refractory and disobedient before that period each exertion of his influence must have be particular and found on the peculiar circumstances of the case after it submission be no longer a matter of choice in the bulk of the community but be rigorously exact by the authority of the supreme magistrate in all governments there be a perpetual intestine struggle open or secret between authority and liberty and neither of them can ever absolutely prevail in the contest a great sacrifice of liberty must necessarily be make in every government yet even the authority which confine liberty can never and perhaps ought never in any constitution to become quite entire and uncontroulable the sultan be master of the life and fortune of any individual but will not be permit to impose new tax on his subject a french monarch can impose tax at pleasure but would find it dangerous to attempt the live and fortunes of individuals religion also in most countries be commonly find to be a very intractable principle and other principles or prejudice frequently resist all the authority of the civil magistrate whose power be found on opinion can never subvert other opinions equally root with that of his title to dominion the government which in common appellation receive the appellation of free be that which admit of a partition of power among several members whose unite authority be no less or be commonly greater than that of any monarch but who in the usual course of administration must act by general and equal laws that be previously know to all the members and to all their subject in this sense it must be own that liberty be the perfection of civil society but still authority must be acknowledge essential to its very existence and in those contest which so often take place between the one and the other the latter may on that account challenge the preference unless perhaps one may say and it may be say with some reason that a circumstance which be essential to the existence of civil society must always support itself and need be guard with less jealousy than one that contribute only to its perfection which the indolence of men be so apt to neglect or their ignorance to overlook essay of the independency of parliamenta political writers have establish it as a maxim that in contrive any system of government and fix the several check and controuls of the constitution every man ought to be suppose a knave and to have no other end in all his action than private interest by this interest we must govern him and by mean of it make him notwithstanding his insatiable avarice and ambition cooperate to public good without this say they we shall in vain boast of the advantage of any constitution and shall find in the end that we have no security for our liberties or possessions except the goodwill of our rulers that be we shall have no security at all it be therefore a just political maxim that every man must be suppose a knave though at the same time it appear somewhat strange that a maxim should be true in politics which be false in fact but to satisfy us on this head we may consider that men be generally more honest in their private than in their public capacity and will go greater lengths to serve a party than when their own private interest be alone concern honour be a great check upon mankind but where a considerable body of men act together this check be in a great measure remove since a man be sure to be approve of by his own party for what promote the common interest and he soon learn to despise the clamour of adversaries to which we may add that every court or senate be determine by the greater number of voice so that if selfinterest influence only the majority as it will always dob the whole senate follow the allurements of this separate interest and act as if it contain not one member who have any regard to public interest and liberty when there offer therefore to our censure and examination any plan of government real or imaginary where the power be distribute among several court and several order of men we should always consider the separate interest of each court and each order and if we find that by the skilful division of power this interest must necessarily in its operation concur with public we may pronounce that government to be wise and happy if on the contrary separate interest be not check and be not direct to the public we ought to look for nothing but faction disorder and tyranny from such a government in this opinion be justify by experience as well as by the authority of all philosophers and politicians both antient and modern how much therefore would it have surprise such a genius as cicero or tacitus to have be tell that in a future age there should arise a very regular system of mix government where the authority be so distribute that one rank whenever it please might swallow up all the rest and engross the whole power of the constitution such a government they would say will not be a mix government for so great be the natural ambition of men that they be never satisfy with power and if one order of men by pursue its own interest can usurp upon every other order it will certainly do so and render itself as far as possible absolute and uncontroulable but in this opinion experience shew they would have be mistake for this be actually the case with the british constitution the share of power allot by our constitution to the house of commons be so great that it absolutely command all the other part of the government the kings legislative power be plainly no proper check to it for though the king have a negative in frame laws yet this in fact be esteem of so little moment that whatever be vote by the two house be always sure to pass into a law and the royal assent be little better than a form the principal weight of the crown lie in the executive power but besides that the executive power in every government be altogether subordinate to the legislative besides this say the exercise of this power require an immense expence and the commons have assume to themselves the sole right of grant money how easy therefore would it be for that house to wrest from the crown all these power one after another by make every grant conditional and choose their time so well that their refusal of supply should only distress the government without give foreign power any advantage over us do the house of commons depend in the same manner on the king and have none of the members any property but from his gift would not he command all their resolutions and be from that moment absolute as to the house of lord they be a very powerful support to the crown so long as they be in their turn support by it but both experience and reason shew that they have no force or authority sufficient to maintain themselves alone without such support how therefore shall we solve this paradox and by what mean be this member of our constitution confine within the proper limit since from our very constitution it must necessarily have as much power as it demand and can only be confine by itself how be this consistent with our experience of human nature answer that the interest of the body be here restrain by that of the individuals and that the house of commons stretch not its power because such an usurpation would be contrary to the interest of the majority of its members the crown have so many offices at its disposal that when assist by the honest and disinterested part of the house it will always command the resolutions of the whole so far at least as to preserve the antient constitution from danger we may therefore give to this influence what name we please we may call it by the invidious appellations of corruption and dependence but some degree and some kind of it be inseparable from the very nature of the constitution and necessary to the preservation of our mix government instead then of assert absolutely that the dependence of parliament in every degree be an infringement of british liberty the countryparty should have make some concessions to their adversaries and have only examine what be the proper degree of this dependence beyond which it become dangerous to liberty but such a moderation be not to be expect in partymen of any kind after a concession of this nature all declamation must be abandon and a calm enquiry into the proper degree of courtinfluence and parliamentary dependence would have be expect by the readers and though the advantage in such a controversy might possibly remain to the countryparty yet the victory would not be so compleat as they wish for nor would a true patriot have give an entire loose to his zeal for fear of run matter into a contrary extreme by diminish too far the influence of the crown it be therefore think best to deny that this extreme could ever be dangerous to the constitution or that the crown could ever have too little influence over members of parliament all question concern the proper medium between extremes be difficult to be decide both because it be not easy to find word proper to fix this medium and because the good and ill in such case run so gradually into each other as even to render our sentiments doubtful and uncertain but there be a peculiar difficulty in the present case which would embarrass the most know and most impartial examiner the power of the crown be always lodge in a single person either king or minister and as this person may have either a greater or less degree of ambition capacity courage popularity or fortune the power which be too great in one hand may become too little in another in pure republics where the authority be distribute among several assemblies or senates the check and controuls be more regular in their operation because the members of such numerous assemblies may be presume to be always nearly equal in capacity and virtue and it be only their number riches or authority which enter into consideration but a limit monarchy admit not of any such stability nor be it possible to assign to the crown such a determinate degree of power as will in every hand form a proper counterbalance to the other part of the constitution this be an unavoidable disadvantage among the many advantage attend that species of government essay whether the british government incline more to absolute monarchy or to a republic it afford a violent prejudice against almost every science that no prudent man however sure of his principles dare prophesy concern any event or foretel the remote consequences of things a physician will not venture to pronounce concern the condition of his patient a fortnight or month after and still less dare a politician foretel the situation of public affairs a few years hence harrington think himself so sure of his general principle that the balance of power depend on that of property that he venture to pronounce it impossible ever to reestablish monarchy in england but his book be scarcely publish when the king be restore and we see that monarchy have ever since subsist upon the same foot as before notwithstanding this unlucky example will venture to examine an important question to wit whether thebritishgovernment incline more to absolute monarchy or to a republic and in which of these two species of government it will most probably terminate as there seem not to be any great danger of a sudden revolution either way shall at least escape the shame attend my temerity if should be find to have be mistake those who assert that the balance of our government incline towards absolute monarchy may support their opinion by the follow reason that property have a great influence on power can not possibly be deny but yet the general maxim that the balance of one depend on the balance of the other must be receive with several limitations it be evident that much less property in a single hand will be able to counterbalance a greater property in several not only because it be difficult to make many persons combine in the same view and measure but because property when unite cause much greater dependence than the same property when disperse a hundred persons of l a year apiece can consume all their income and no body shall ever be the better for them except their servants and tradesmen who justly regard their profit as the product of their own labour but a man possess of l a year if he have either any generosity or any cunning may create a great dependence by obligations and still a greater by expectations hence we may observe that in all free governments any subject exorbitantly rich have always create jealousy even though his riches bore no proportion to those of the state crassuss fortune if remember well amount only to about two millions and a half of our moneya b yet we find that though his genius be nothing extraordinary he be able by mean of his riches alone to counterbalance during his lifetime the power of pompey as well as that of cæsar who afterwards become master of the world the wealth of the medici make them master of florence though it be probable it be not considerable compare to the unite property of that opulent republic these considerations be apt to make one entertain a magnificent idea of the british spirit and love of liberty since we could maintain our free government during so many centuries against our sovereigns who besides the power and dignity and majesty of the crown have always be possess of much more property than any subject have ever enjoy in any commonwealth but it may be say that this spirit however great will never be able to support itself against that immense property which be now lodge in the king and which be still encreasing upon a moderate computation there be near three millions a year at the disposal of the crown the civil list amount to near a million the collection of all tax to another and the employments in the army and navy together with ecclesiastical preferments to above a third million an enormous sum and what may fairly be compute to be more than a thirtieth part of the whole income and labour of the kingdom when we add to this great property the encreasing luxury of the nation our proneness to corruption together with the great power and prerogatives of the crown and the command of military force there be no one but must despair of be able without extraordinary efforts to support our free government much longer under these disadvantage on the other hand those who maintain that the byass of the british government lean towards a republic may support their opinion by specious arguments it may be say that though this immense property in the crown be join to the dignity of first magistrate and to many other legal power and prerogatives which should naturally give it greater influence yet it really become less dangerous to liberty upon that very account be england a republic and be any private man possess of a revenue a third or even a tenth part as large as that of the crown he would very justly excite jealousy because he would infallibly have great authority in the government and such an irregular authority not avow by the laws be always more dangerous than a much greater authority derive from them a man possess of usurp power can set no bound to his pretensionsc his partizans have liberty to hope for every thing in his favour his enemies provoke his ambition with his fear by the violence of their opposition and the government be throw into a ferment every corrupt humour in the state naturally gather to him on the contrary a legal authority though great have always some bound which terminate both the hop and pretensions of the person possess of it the laws must have provide a remedy against its excesses such an eminent magistrate have much to fear and little to hope from his usurpations and as his legal authority be quietly submit to he have small temptation and small opportunity of extend it farther besides it happen with regard to ambitious aim and project what may be observe with regard to sects of philosophy and religion a new sect excite such a ferment and be both oppose and defend with such vehemence that it always spread faster and multiply its partizans with greater rapidity than any old establish opinion recommend by the sanction of the laws and of antiquity such be the nature of novelty that where any thing please it become doubly agreeable if new but if it displease it be doubly displease upon that very account and in most case the violence of enemies be favourable to ambitious project as well as the zeal of partizans it may farther be say that though men be much govern by interest yet even interest itself and all human affairs be entirely govern by opinion now there have be a sudden and sensible change in the opinions of men within these last fifty years by the progress of learn and of liberty most people in this island have divest themselves of all superstitious reverence to name and authority the clergy have much lostd their credit their pretensions and doctrines have be ridicule and even religion can scarcely support itself in the world the mere name of king command little respect and to talk of a king as gods vicegerent on earth or to give him any of those magnificent title which formerly dazzle mankind would but excite laughter in every one though the crown by mean of its large revenue may maintain its authority in time of tranquillity upon private interest and influence yet as the least shock or convulsion must break all these interest to piece the royal power be no longer support by the settle principles and opinions of men will immediately dissolve have men be in the same disposition at the revolution as they be at present monarchy would have run a great risque of be entirely lose in this island durst venture to deliver my own sentiments amidst these opposite arguments would assert that unless there happen some extraordinary convulsion the power of the crown by mean of its large revenue be rather upon the encrease though at the same time own that its progress seem very slow and almost insensible the tide have run long and with some rapidity to the side of popular government and be just begin to turn towards monarchy it be well know that every government must come to a period and that death be unavoidable to the political as well as to the animal body but as one kind of death may be preferable to another it may be enquire whether it be more desirable for the british constitution to terminate in a popular government or in absolute monarchy here would frankly declare that though liberty be preferable to slavery in almost every case yet should rather wish to see an absolute monarch than a republic in this island for let us consider what kind of republic we have reason to expect the question be not concern any fine imaginary republic of which a man may form a plan in his closet there be no doubt but a popular government may be imagine more perfect than absolute monarchy or even than our present constitution but what reason have we to expect that any such government will ever be establish in great britain upon the dissolution of our monarchy if any single person acquire power enough to take our constitution to piece and put it up anew he be really an absolute monarch and we have already have an instance of this kind sufficient to convince us that such a person will never resign his power or establish any free government matter therefore must be trust to their natural progress and operation and the house of commons accord to its present constitution must be the only legislature in such a popular government the inconveniencies attend such a situation of affairs present themselves by thousands if the house of commons in such a case ever dissolve itself which be not to be expect we may look for a civil war every election if it continue itself we shall suffer all the tyranny of a faction subdivide into new factions and as such a violent government can not long subsist we shall at last after many convulsions and civil war find repose in absolute monarchy which it would have be happier for us to have establish peaceably from the begin absolute monarchy therefore be the easiest death the true euthanasia of the british constitution thus if we have reason to be more jealous of monarchy because the danger be more imminent from that quarter we have also reason to be more jealous of popular government because that danger be more terrible this may teach us a lesson of moderation in all our political controversies essay of party in general of all men that distinguish themselves by memorable achievements the first place of honour seem due to legislators and founder of state who transmit a system of laws and institutions to secure the peace happiness and liberty of future generations the influence of useful inventions in the arts and sciences may perhaps extend farther than that of wise laws whose effect be limit both in time and place but the benefit arise from the former be not so sensible as that which result from the latter speculative sciences do indeed improve the mind but this advantage reach only to a few persons who have leisure to apply themselves to them and as to practical arts which encrease the commodities and enjoyments of life it be well know that mens happiness consist not so much in an abundance of these as in the peace and security with which they possess them and those bless can only be derive from good government not to mention that general virtue and good morals in a state which be so requisite to happiness can never arise from the most refine precepts of philosophy or even the severest injunctions of religion but must proceed entirely from the virtuous education of youth the effect of wise laws and institutions must therefore presume to differ from lord bacon in this particular and must regard antiquity as somewhat unjust in its distribution of honour when it make gods of all the inventors of useful arts such as cere bacchus æsculapius and dignify legislators such as romulus and theseus only with the appellation of demigods and heroes as much as legislators and founder of state ought to be honour and respect among men as much ought the founder of sects and factions to be detest and hat because the influence of faction be directly contrary to that of laws factions subvert government render laws impotent and beget the fiercest animosities among men of the same nation who ought to give mutual assistance and protection to each other and what should render the founder of party more odious be the difficulty of extirpate these weed when once they have take root in any state they naturally propagate themselves for many centuries and seldom end but by the total dissolution of that government in which they be sow they be besides plant which grow most plentifully in the richest soil and though absolute governments be not wholly free from them it must be confess that they rise more easily and propagate themselves faster in free governments where they always infect the legislature itself which alone could be able by the steady application of reward and punishments to eradicate them factions may be divide into personal and real that be into factions found on personal friendship or animosity among such as compose the contend party and into those found on some real difference of sentiment or interest the reason of this distinction be obvious though must acknowledge that party be seldom find pure and unmixed either of the one kind or the other it be not often see that a government divide into factions where there be no difference in the view of the constituent members either real or apparent trivial or material and in those factions which be found on the most real and most material difference there be always observe a great deal of personal animosity or affection but notwithstanding this mixture a party may be denominate either personal or real accord to that principle which be predominant and be find to have the greatest influence personal factions arise most easily in small republics every domestic quarrel there become an affair of state love vanity emulation any passion as well as ambition and resentment beget public division the neri and bianchi of florence the fregosi and adorni of genoa the colonesi and orsini of modern rome be party of this kind men have such a propensity to divide into personal factions that the smallest appearance of real difference will produce them what can be imagine more trivial than the difference between one colour of livery and another in horse race yet this difference beget two most inveterate factions in the greek empire the prasini and veneti who never suspend their animosities till they ruin that unhappy government we find in the roman history a remarkable dissension between two tribes the pollia and papiria which continue for the space of near three hundred years and discover itself in their suffrages at every election of magistrates this faction be the more remarkable as it could continue for so long a tract of time even though it do not spread itself nor draw any of the other tribes into a share of the quarrel if mankind have not a strong propensity to such divisions the indifference of the rest of the community must have suppress this foolish animosity that have not any aliment of new benefit and injuries of general sympathy and antipathy which never fail to take place when the whole state be rent into two equal factionsa nothing be more usual than to see party which have begin upon a real difference continue even after that difference be lose when men be once inlisted on opposite side they contract an affection to the persons with whom they be unite and an animosity against their antagonists and these passions they often transmit to their posterity the real difference between guelf and ghibbelline be long lose in italy before these factions be extinguish the guelfs adhere to the pope the ghibbellines to the emperor yet the family of sforza who be in alliance with the emperor though they be guelfs be expel milan by the king of france assist by jacomo trivulzio and the ghibbellines the pope concur with the latter and they form league with the pope against the emperor the civil war which arise some few years ago in morocco between the black and white merely on account of their complexion be found on a pleasant difference we laugh at them but believe be things rightly examine we afford much more occasion of ridicule to the moor for what be all the war of religion which have prevail in this polite and know part of the world they be certainly more absurd than the moorish civil war the difference of complexion be a sensible and a real difference but the controversy about an article of faith which be utterly absurd and unintelligible be not a difference in sentiment but in a few phrase and expressions which one party accept of without understand them and the other refuse in the same mannerc real factions may be divide into those from interest from principle and from affection of all factions the first be the most reasonable and the most excusable where two order of men such as the nobles and people have a distinct authority in a government not very accurately balance and model they naturally follow a distinct interest nor can we reasonably expect a different conduct consider that degree of selfishness implant in human nature it require great skill in a legislator to prevent such party and many philosophers be of opinion that this secret like the grand elixir or perpetual motion may amuse men in theory but can never possibly be reduce to practice in despotic governments indeed factions often do not appear but they be not the less real or rather they be more real and more pernicious upon that very account the distinct order of men nobles and people soldier and merchants have all a distinct interest but the more powerful oppress the weaker with impunity and without resistance which beget a seem tranquillity in such governmentsd there have be an attempt in england to divide the land and trade part of the nation but without success the interest of these two body be not really distinct and never will be so till our public debts encrease to such a degree as to become altogether oppressive and intolerable party from principle especially abstract speculative principle be know only to modern time and be perhaps the most extraordinary and unaccountable phænomenon that have yet appear in human affairs where different principles beget a contrariety of conduct which be the case with all different political principles the matter may be more easily explain a man who esteem the true right of government to lie in one man or one family can not easily agree with his fellowcitizen who think that another man or family be possess of this right each naturally wish that right may take place accord to his own notions of it but where the difference of principle be attend with no contrariety of action but every one may follow his own way without interfere with his neighbour as happen in all religious controversies what madness what fury can beget such unhappy and such fatal divisions two men travel on the highway the one east the other west can easily pass each other if the way be broad enough but two men reason upon opposite principles of religion can not so easily pass without shock though one should think that the way be also in that case sufficiently broad and that each might proceed without interruption in his own course but such be the nature of the human mind that it always lay hold on every mind that approach it and as it be wonderfully fortify by an unanimity of sentiments so be it shock and disturb by any contrariety hence the eagerness which most people discover in a dispute and hence their impatience of opposition even in the most speculative and indifferent opinions this principle however frivolous it may appear seem to have be the origin of all religious war and divisions but as this principle be universal in human nature its effect would not have be confine to one age and to one sect of religion do it not there concur with other more accidental cause which raise it to such a height as to produce the greatest misery and devastation most religions of the ancient world arise in the unknown age of government when men be as yet barbarous and uninstructed and the prince as well as peasant be dispose to receive with implicit faith every pious tale or fiction which be offer him the magistrate embrace the religion of the people and enter cordially into the care of sacred matter naturally acquire an authority in them and unite the ecclesiastical with the civil power but the christian religion arise while principles directly opposite to it be firmly establish in the polite part of the world who despise the nation that first broach this novelty no wonder that in such circumstances it be but little countenance by the civil magistrate and that the priesthood be allow to engross all the authority in the new sect so bad a use do they make of this power even in those early time that the primitive persecutions may perhaps in part be ascribe to the violence instill by them into their followers and the same principles of priestly government continue after christianity become the establish religion they have engender a spirit of persecution which have ever since be the poison of human society and the source of the most inveterate factions in every government such divisions therefore on the part of the people may justly be esteem factions of principle but on the part of the priests who be the prime movers they be really factions of interest there be another cause beside the authority of the priests and the separation of the ecclesiastical and civil power which have contribute to render christendom the scene of religious war and divisions religions that arise in age totally ignorant and barbarous consist mostly of traditional tales and fictions which may be different in every sect without be contrary to each other and even when they be contrary every one adhere to the tradition of his own sect without much reason or disputation but as philosophy be widely spread over the world at the time when christianity arise the teachers of the new sect be oblige to form a system of speculative opinions to divide with some accuracy their article of faith and to explain comment confute and defend with all the subtilty of argument and science hence naturally arise keenness in dispute when the christian religion come to be split into new divisions and heresies and this keenness assist the priests in their policy of beget a mutual hatred and antipathy among their delude followers sects of philosophy in the ancient world be more zealous than party of religion but in modern time party of religion be more furious and enrage than the most cruel factions that ever arise from interest and ambition have mention party from affection as a kind of real party beside those from interest and principle by party from affection understand those which be found on the different attachments of men towards particular families and persons whom they desire to rule over them these factions be often very violent though must own it may seem unaccountable that men should attach themselves so strongly to persons with whom they be no wise acquaint whom perhaps they never saw and from whom they never receive nor can ever hope for any favour yet this we often find to be the case and even with men who on other occasion discover no great generosity of spirit nor be find to be easily transport by friendship beyond their own interest we be apt to think the relation between us and our sovereign very close and intimate the splendour of majesty and power bestow an importance on the fortunes even of a single person and when a man goodnature do not give him this imaginary interest his illnature will from spite and opposition to persons whose sentiments be different from his own essay of the party of great britain be the british government propose as a subject of speculation one would immediately perceive in it a source of division and party which it would be almost impossible for it under any administration to avoid the just balance between the republican and monarchical part of our constitution be really in itself so extremely delicate and uncertain that when join to mens passions and prejudice it be impossible but different opinions must arise concern it even among persons of the best understand those of mild temper who love peace and order and detest sedition and civil war will always entertain more favourable sentiments of monarchy than men of bold and generous spirit who be passionate lovers of liberty and think no evil comparable to subjection and slavery and though all reasonable men agree in general to preserve our mix government yet when they come to particulars some will incline to trust greater power to the crown to bestow on it more influence and to guard against its encroachments with less caution than others who be terrify at the most distant approach of tyranny and despotic power thus be there party of principle involve in the very nature of our constitution which may properly enough be denominate those of court and countrya the strength and violence of each of these party will much depend upon the particular administration an administration may be so bad as to throw a great majority into the opposition as a good administration will reconcile to the court many of the most passionate lovers of liberty but however the nation may fluctuate between them the party themselves will always subsist so long as we be govern by a limit monarchy but besides this difference of principle those party be very much foment by a difference of interest without which they could scarcely ever be dangerous or violent the crown will naturally bestow all trust and power upon those whose principles real or pretend be most favourable to monarchical government and this temptation will naturally engage them to go greater lengths than their principles would otherwise carry them their antagonists who be disappoint in their ambitious aim throw themselves into the party whose sentiments incline them to be most jealous of royal power and naturally carry those sentiments to a greater height than sound politics will justify thus court and country which be the genuine offspring of the british government be a kind of mix party and be influence both by principle and by interest the head of the factions be commonly most govern by the latter motive the inferior members of them by the formerb as to ecclesiastical party we may observe that in all age of the world priests have be enemies to libertyc and it be certain that this steady conduct of theirs must have be found on fix reason of interest and ambition liberty of think and of express our thoughts be always fatal to priestly power and to those pious frauds on which it be commonly found and by an infallible connexion which prevail among all kinds of liberty this privilege can never be enjoy at least have never yet be enjoy but in a free government hence it must happen in such a constitution as that of great britain that the establish clergy while things be in their natural situation will always be of the courtparty as on the contrary dissenters of all kinds will be of the countryparty since they can never hope for that toleration which they stand in need of but by mean of our free government all princes that have aim at despotic power have know of what importance it be to gain the establish clergy as the clergy on their part have shew a great facility in enter into the view of such princesgustavus vaza be perhaps the only ambitious monarch that ever depress the church at the same time that he discourage liberty but the exorbitant power of the bishops in sweden who at that time overtop the crown itself together with their attachment to a foreign family be the reason of his embrace such an unusual system of politics this observation concern the propensity of priests to the government of a single person be not true with regard to one sect only the presbyterian and calvinistic clergy in holland be profess friends to the family of orange as the arminians who be esteem heretics be of the louvestein faction and zealous for liberty but if a prince have the choice of both it be easy to see that he will prefer the episcopal to the presbyterian form of government both because of the greater affinity between monarchy and episcopacy and because of the facility which he will find in such a government of rule the clergy by mean of their ecclesiastical superiors if we consider the first rise of party in england during the great rebellion we shall observe that it be conformable to this general theory and that the species of government give birth to them by a regular and infallible operation the english constitution before that period have lie in a kind of confusion yet so as that the subject possess many noble privilege which though not exactly bound and secure by law be universally deem from long possession to belong to them as their birthright an ambitious or rather a misguide prince arise who deem all these privilege to be concessions of his predecessors revokeable at pleasure and in prosecution of this principle he openly act in violation of liberty during the course of several years necessity at last constrain him to call a parliament the spirit of liberty arise and spread itself the prince be without any support be oblige to grant every thing require of him and his enemies jealous and implacable set no bound to their pretensions here then begin those contest in which it be no wonder that men of that age be divide into different party since even at this day the impartial be at a loss to decide concern the justice of the quarrel the pretensions of the parliament if yield to break the balance of the constitution by render the government almost entirely republican if not yield to the nation be perhaps still in danger of absolute power from the settle principles and inveterate habit of the king which have plainly appear in every concession that he have be constrain to make to his people in this question so delicate and uncertain men naturally fell to the side which be most conformable to their usual principles and the more passionate favourers of monarchy declare for the king as the zealous friends of liberty side with the parliament the hop of success be nearly equal on both side interest have no general influence in this contest so that roundhead and cavalier be merely party of principle neither of which disown either monarchy or liberty but the former party incline most to the republican part of our government the latter to the monarchical in this respect they may be consider as court and countryparty enflamed into a civil war by an unhappy concurrence of circumstances and by the turbulent spirit of the age the commonwealths men and the partizans of absolute power lay conceal in both party and form but an inconsiderable part of them the clergy have concur with the kings arbitrary design and in return be allow to persecute their adversaries whom they call heretics and schismatics the establish clergy be episcopal the nonconformists presbyterian so that all things concur to throw the former without reserve into the kings party and the latter into that of the parliamentf every one know the event of this quarrel fatal to the king first to the parliament afterwards after many confusions and revolutions the royal family be at last restore and the ancient government reestablishedcharles be not make wiser by the example of his father but prosecute the same measure though at first with more secrecy and caution new party arise under the appellation of whig and tory which have continue ever since to confound and distract our government to determine the nature of these party be perhaps one of the most difficult problems that can be meet with and be a proof that history may contain question as uncertain as any to be find in the most abstract sciences we have see the conduct of the two party during the course of seventy years in a vast variety of circumstances possess of power and deprive of it during peace and during war persons who profess themselves of one side or other we meet with every hour in company in our pleasures in our serious occupations we ourselves be constrain in a manner to take party and live in a country of the highest liberty every one may openly declare all his sentiments and opinions yet be we at a loss to tell the nature pretensions and principles of the different factionsg when we compare the party of whig and tory with those of roundhead and cavalier the most obvious difference that appear between them consist in the principles of passive obedience and indefeasible right which be but little hear of among the cavaliers but become the universal doctrine and be esteem the true characteristic of a tory be these principles push into their most obvious consequences they imply a formal renunciation of all our liberties and an avowal of absolute monarchy since nothing can be a greater absurdity than a limit power which must not be resist even when it exceed its limitations but as the most rational principles be often but a weak counterpoise to passion it be no wonder that these absurd principlesh be find too weak for that effect the tories as men be enemies to oppression and also as englishmen they be enemies to arbitrary power their zeal for liberty be perhaps less fervent than that of their antagonists but be sufficient to make them forget all their general principles when they saw themselves openly threaten with a subversion of the ancient government from these sentiments arise the revolution an event of mighty consequence and the firmest foundation of british liberty the conduct of the tories during that event and after it will afford us a true insight into the nature of that party in the first place they appear to have have the genuine sentiments of britons in their affection for liberty and in their determine resolution not to sacrifice it to any abstract principle whatsoever or to any imaginary right of princes this part of their character might justly have be doubt of before the revolution from the obvious tendency of their avow principles and from theiri compliances with a court which seem to make little secret of its arbitrary design the revolution shew them to have be in this respect nothing but a genuine courtparty such as might be expect in a british government that be lovers of liberty but greater lovers of monarchy it must however be confess that they carry their monarchical principles farther even in practice but more so in theory than be in any degree consistent with a limit government secondly neither their principles nor affections concur entirely or heartily with the settlement make at the revolution or with that which have since take place this part of their character may seem opposite to the former since any other settlement in those circumstances of the nation must probably have be dangerous if not fatal to liberty but the heart of man be make to reconcile contradictions and this contradiction be not greater than that between passive obedience and the resistance employ at the revolution a tory therefore since the revolution may be define in a few word to be a lover of monarchy though without abandon liberty and a partizan of the family ofstuart as a whig may be define to be a lover of liberty though without renounce monarchy and a friend to the settlement in theprotestantlinej these different view with regard to the settlement of the crown be accidental but natural additions to the principles of the court and country party which be the genuine divisions in the british government a passionate lover of monarchy be apt to be displease at any change of the succession as savour too much of a commonwealth a passionate lover of liberty be apt to think that every part of the government ought to be subordinate to the interest of liberty some who will not venture to assert that the real difference between whig and tory be lose at the revolution seem incline to think that the difference be now abolish and that affairs be so far return to their natural state that there be at present no other party among us but court and country that be men who by interest or principle be attach either to monarchy or liberty the tories have be so long oblige to talk in the republican stile that they seem to have make convert of themselves by their hypocrisy and to have embrace the sentiments as well as language of their adversaries there be however very considerable remain of that party in england with all their old prejudice and a proof that court and country be not our only party be that almost all the dissenters side with the court and the lower clergy at least of the church of england with the opposition this may convince us that some bias still hang upon our constitution some extrinsic weight which turn it from its natural course and cause a confusion in our party k essay of superstition and enthusiasm that the corruption of the best things produce the worst be grow into a maxim and be commonly prove among other instance by the pernicious effect of superstition and enthusiasm the corruptions of true religion these two species of false religion though both pernicious be yet of a very different and even of a contrary nature the mind of man be subject to certain unaccountable terrors and apprehensions proceed either from the unhappy situation of private or public affairs from ill health from a gloomy and melancholy disposition or from the concurrence of all these circumstances in such a state of mind infinite unknown evils be dread from unknown agents and where real object of terror be want the soul active to its own prejudice and foster its predominant inclination find imaginary ones to whose power and malevolence it set no limit as these enemies be entirely invisible and unknown the methods take to appease them be equally unaccountable and consist in ceremonies observances mortifications sacrifice present or in any practice however absurd or frivolous which either folly or knavery recommend to a blind and terrify credulity weakness fear melancholy together with ignorance be therefore the true source of superstition but the mind of man be also subject to an unaccountable elevation and presumption arise from prosperous success from luxuriant health from strong spirit or from a bold and confident disposition in such a state of mind the imagination swell with great but confuse conceptions to which no sublunary beauties or enjoyments can correspond every thing mortal and perishable vanish as unworthy of attention and a full range be give to the fancy in the invisible regions or world of spirit where the soul be at liberty to indulge itself in every imagination which may best suit its present taste and disposition hence arise rapturestransports and surprise flight of fancy and confidence and presumption still encreasing these raptures be altogether unaccountable and seem quite beyond the reach of our ordinary faculties be attribute to the immediate inspiration of that divine be who be the object of devotion in a little time the inspire person come to regard himself as a distinguish favourite of the divinity and when this frenzy once take place which be the summit of enthusiasm every whimsy be consecrate human reason and even morality be reject as fallacious guide and the fanatic madman deliver himself over blindly and without reserve to the suppose illapses of the spirit and to inspiration from above hope pride presumption a warm imagination together with ignorance be therefore the true source of enthusiasm these two species of false religion might afford occasion to many speculations but shall confine myself at present to a few reflections concern their different influence on government and society a my first reflection be that superstition be favourable to priestly power and enthusiasm not less or rather more contrary to it than sound reason and philosophy as superstition be found on fear sorrow and a depression of spirit it represent the man to himself in such despicable colour that he appear unworthy in his own eye of approach the divine presence and naturally have recourse to any other person whose sanctity of life or perhaps impudence and cunning have make him be suppose more favour by the divinity to him the superstitious entrust their devotions to his care they recommend their prayers petition and sacrifice and by his mean they hope to render their address acceptable to their incense deity hence the origin of priestsb who may justly be regardedc as an invention of a timorous and abject superstition which ever diffident of itself dare not offer up its own devotions but ignorantly think to recommend itself to the divinity by the mediation of his suppose friends and servants as superstition be a considerable ingredient in almost all religions even the most fanatical there be nothing but philosophy able entirely to conquer these unaccountable terrors hence it proceed that in almost every sect of religion there be priests to be find but the stronger mixture there be of superstition the higher be the authority of the priesthoodd on the other hand it may be observe that all enthusiasts have be free from the yoke of ecclesiastics and have express great independence in their devotion with a contempt of form ceremonies and traditions the quakers be the most egregious though at the same time the most innocent enthusiasts that have yet be know and be perhaps the only sect that have never admit priests amongst them the independents of all the english sectaries approach nearest to the quakers in fanaticism and in their freedom from priestly bondage the presbyterians follow after at an equal distance in both particulars in short this observation be found in experience and will also appear to be found in reason if we consider that as enthusiasm arise from a presumptuous pride and confidence it think itself sufficiently qualify to approach the divinity without any human mediator its rapturous devotions be so fervent that it even imagine itself actually to approach him by the way of contemplation and inward converse which make it neglect all those outward ceremonies and observances to which the assistance of the priests appear so requisite in the eye of their superstitious votaries the fanatic consecrate himself and bestow on his own person a sacred character much superior to what form and ceremonious institutions can confer on any other my second reflection with regard to these species of false religion be that religions which partake of enthusiasm be on their first rise more furious and violent than those which partake of superstition but in a little time become more gentle and moderate the violence of this species of religion when excite by novelty and animate by opposition appear from numberless instance of the anabaptists in germany the camisars in france the levellers and other fanatics in england and the covenanters in scotland enthusiasm be found on strong spirit and a presumptuous boldness of character it naturally beget the most extreme resolutions especially after it rise to that height as to inspire the delude fanatic with the opinion of divine illuminations and with a contempt for the common rule of reason morality and prudence it be thus enthusiasm produce the most cruel disorder in human society but its fury be like that of thunder and tempest which exhaust themselves in a little time and leave the air more calm and serene than before when the first fire of enthusiasm be spend men naturally in all fanatical sects sink into the greatest remissness and coolness in sacred matter there be no body of men among them endow with sufficient authority whose interest be concern to support the religious spirit no rites no ceremonies no holy observances which may enter into the common train of life and preserve the sacred principles from oblivion superstition on the contrary steal in gradually and insensibly render men tame and submissive be acceptable to the magistrate and seem inoffensive to the people till at last the priest have firmly establish his authority become the tyrant and disturber of human society by his endless contentions persecutions and religious war how smoothly do the romish church advance in her acquisition of power but into what dismal convulsions do she throw all europe in order to maintain it on the other hand our sectaries who be formerly such dangerous bigots be now become very free reasoners and the quakers seem to approach nearly the only regular body of deists in the universe the literati or the disciples of confucius in china my third observation on this head be that superstition be an enemy to civil liberty and enthusiasm a friend to it as superstition groan under the dominion of priests and enthusiasm be destructive of all ecclesiastical power this sufficiently account for the present observation not to mention that enthusiasm be the infirmity of bold and ambitious temper be naturally accompany with a spirit of liberty as superstition on the contrary render men tame and abject and fit them for slavery we learn from english history that during the civil war the independents and deists though the most opposite in their religious principles yet be unite in their political ones and be alike passionate for a commonwealth and since the origin of whig and tory the leaders of the whigs have either be deists or profest latitudinarians in their principles that be friends to toleration and indifferent to any particular sect of christians while the sectaries who have all a strong tincture of enthusiasm have always without exception concur with that party in defence of civil liberty the resemblance in their superstitions long unite the highchurch tories and the roman catholics in support of prerogative and kingly power though experience of the tolerate spirit of the whigs seem of late to have reconcile the catholics to that party the molinists and jansenists in france have a thousand unintelligible dispute which be not worthy the reflection of a man of sense but what principally distinguish these two sects and alone merit attention be the different spirit of their religion the molinists conduct by the jesuits be great friends to superstition rigid observers of external form and ceremonies and devote to the authority of the priests and to tradition the jansenists be enthusiasts and zealous promoters of the passionate devotion and of the inward life little influence by authority and in a word but half catholics the consequences be exactly conformable to the forego reason the jesuits be the tyrants of the people and the slave of the court and the jansenists preserve alive the small spark of the love of liberty which be to be find in the french nation essay of the dignity or meanness of human naturea there be certain sects which secretly form themselves in the learn world as well as factions in the political and though sometimes they come not to an open rupture they give a different turn to the ways of think of those who have take part on either side the most remarkable of this kind be the sects found on the different sentiments with regard to the dignity of human nature which be a point that seem to have divide philosophers and poets as well as divine from the begin of the world to this day some exalt our species to the sky and represent man as a kind of human demigod who derive his origin from heaven and retain evident mark of his lineage and descent others insist upon the blind side of human nature and can discover nothing except vanity in which man surpass the other animals whom he affect so much to despise if an author possess the talent of rhetoric and declamation he commonly take part with the former if his turn lie towards irony and ridicule he naturally throw himself into the other extreme be far from think that all those who have depreciate our species have be enemies to virtue and have expose the frailties of their fellow creatures with any bad intention on the contrary be sensible that a delicate sense of morals especially when attend with a splenetic temperb be apt to give a man a disgust of the world and to make him consider the common course of human affairs with too much indignation must however be of opinion that the sentiments of those who be incline to think favourably of mankind be more advantageous to virtue than the contrary principles which give us a mean opinion of our nature when a man be prepossess with a high notion of his rank and character in the creation he will naturally endeavour to act up to it and will scorn to do a base or vicious action which might sink him below that figure which he make in his own imagination accordingly we find that all our polite and fashionable moralists insist upon this topic and endeavour to represent vice as unworthy of man as well as odious in itselfc we find few dispute that be not found on some ambiguity in the expression and be persuade that the present dispute concern the dignity or meanness of human nature be not more exempt from it than any other it may therefore be worth while to consider what be real and what be only verbal in this controversy that there be a natural difference between merit and demerit virtue and vice wisdom and folly no reasonable man will deny yet be it evident that in affix the term which denote either our approbation or blame we be commonly more influence by comparison than by any fix unalterable standard in the nature of things in like manner quantity and extension and bulk be by every one acknowledge to be real things but when we call any animal great or little we always form a secret comparison between that animal and others of the same species and it be that comparison which regulate our judgment concern its greatness a dog and a horse may be of the very same size while the one be admire for the greatness of its bulk and the other for the smallness when be present therefore at any dispute always consider with myself whether it be a question of comparison or not that be the subject of the controversy and if it be whether the disputants compare the same object together or talk of things that be widely differentd in form our notions of human nature we be apt to make a comparison between men and animals the only creatures endow with think that fall under our sense certainly this comparison be favourable to mankind on the one hand we see a creature whose thoughts be not limit by any narrow bound either of place or time who carry his research into the most distant regions of this globe and beyond this globe to the planets and heavenly body look backward to consider the first origin at least the history of human race cast his eye forward to see the influence of his action upon posterity and the judgments which will be form of his character a thousand years hence a creature who trace cause and effect to a great length and intricacy extract general principles from particular appearances improve upon his discoveries correct his mistake and make his very errors profitable on the other hand we be present with a creature the very reverse of this limit in its observations and reason to a few sensible object which surround it without curiosity without foresight blindly conduct by instinct and attain in a short time its utmost perfection beyond which it be never able to advance a single step what a wide difference be there between these creatures and how exalt a notion must we entertain of the former in comparison of the latter there be two mean commonly employ to destroy this conclusion first by make an unfair representation of the case and insist only upon the weaknesses of human nature and secondly by form a new and secret comparison between man and be of the most perfect wisdom among the other excellencies of man this be one that he can form an idea of perfections much beyond what he have experience of in himself and be not limit in his conception of wisdom and virtue he can easily exalt his notions and conceive a degree of knowledge which when compare to his own will make the latter appear very contemptible and will cause the difference between that and the sagacity of animals in a manner to disappear and vanish now this be a point in which all the world be agree that human understand fall infinitely short of perfect wisdom it be proper we should know when this comparison take place that we may not dispute where there be no real difference in our sentiments man fall much more short of perfect wisdom and even of his own ideas of perfect wisdom than animals do of man yet the latter difference be so considerable that nothing but a comparison with the former can make it appear of little moment it be also usual to compare one man with another and find very few whom we can call wise or virtuous we be apt to entertain a contemptible notion of our species in general that we may be sensible of the fallacy of this way of reason we may observe that the honourable appellations of wise and virtuous be not annex to any particular degree of those qualities of wisdom and virtue but arise altogether from the comparison we make between one man and another when we find a man who arrive at such a pitch of wisdom as be very uncommon we pronounce him a wise man so that to say there be few wise men in the world be really to say nothing since it be only by their scarcity that they merit that appellation be the lowest of our species as wise as tully or lord bacon we should still have reason to say that there be few wise men for in that case we should exalt our notions of wisdom and should not pay a singular honour to any one who be not singularly distinguish by his talents in like manner have hear it observe by thoughtless people that there be few women possess of beauty in comparison of those who want it not consider that we bestow the epithet of beautiful only on such as possess a degree of beauty that be common to them with a few the same degree of beauty in a woman be call deformity which be treat as real beauty in one of our sex as it be usual in form a notion of our species to compare it with the other species above or below it or to compare the individuals of the species among themselves so we often compare together the different motives or actuate principles of human nature in order to regulate our judgment concern it and indeed this be the only kind of comparison which be worth our attention or decide any thing in the present question be our selfish and vicious principles so much predominant above our social and virtuous as be assert by some philosophers we ought undoubtedly to entertain a contemptible notion of human nature there be much of a dispute of word in all this controversy when a man deny the sincerity of all public spirit or affection to a country and community be at a loss what to think of him perhaps he never felt this passion in so clear and distinct a manner as to remove all his doubt concern its force and reality but when he proceed afterwards to reject all private friendship if no interest or selflove intermix itself be then confident that he abuse term and confound the ideas of things since it be impossible for any one to be so selfish or rather so stupid as to make no difference between one man and another and give no preference to qualities which engage his approbation and esteem be he also say as insensible to anger as he pretend to be to friendship and do injury and wrong no more affect him than kindness or benefit impossible he do not know himself he have forget the movements of his heart or rather he make use of a different language from the rest of his countrymen and call not things by their proper name what say you of natural affection subjoin be that also a species of selflove yes all be selflove your children be love only because they be yours your friend for a like reason and your country engage you only so far as it have a connexion with yourself be the idea of self remove nothing would affect you you would be altogether unactive and insensible or if you ever give yourself any movement it would only be from vanity and a desire of fame and reputation to this same self be will reply to receive your interpretation of human action provide you admit the facts that species of selflove which display itself in kindness to others you must allow to have great influence over human action and even greater on many occasion than that which remain in its original shape and form for how few be there who have a family children and relations do not spend more on the maintenance and education of these than on their own pleasures this indeed you justly observe may proceed from their selflove since the prosperity of their family and friends be one or the chief of their pleasures as well as their chief honour be you also one of these selfish men and you be sure of every ones good opinion and good will or not to shock your ears with these expressions the selflove of every one and mine among the rest will then incline us to serve you and speak well of youe in my opinion there be two things which have lead astray those philosophers that have insist so much on the selfishness of man in the first place they find that every act of virtue or friendship be attend with a secret pleasure whence they conclude that friendship and virtue could not be disinterested but the fallacy of this be obvious the virtuous sentiment or passion produce the pleasure and do not arise from it feel a pleasure in do good to my friend because love him but do not love him for the sake of that pleasure in the second place it have always be find that the virtuous be far from be indifferent to praise and therefore they have be represent as a set of vainglorious men who have nothing in view but the applauses of others but this also be a fallacy it be very unjust in the world when they find any tincture of vanity in a laudable action to depreciate it upon that account or ascribe it entirely to that motive the case be not the same with vanity as with other passions where avarice or revenge enter into any seemingly virtuous action it be difficult for us to determine how far it enter and it be natural to suppose it the sole actuate principle but vanity be so closely ally to virtue and to love the fame of laudable action approach so near the love of laudable action for their own sake that these passions be more capable of mixture than any other kinds of affection and it be almost impossible to have the latter without some degree of the former accordingly we find that this passion for glory be always warp and vary accord to the particular taste or disposition of the mind on which it fall nero have the same vanity in drive a chariot that trajan have in govern the empire with justice and ability to love the glory of virtuous deeds be a sure proof of the love of virtue essay of libertya those who employ their pen on political subject free from partyrage and partyprejudices cultivate a science which of all others contribute most to public utility and even to the private satisfaction of those who addict themselves to the study of it be apt however to entertain a suspicion that the world be still too young to fix many general truths in politics which will remain true to the latest posterity we have not as yet have experience of three thousand years so that not only the art of reason be still imperfect in this science as in all others but we even want sufficient materials upon which we can reason it be not fully know what degree of refinement either in virtue or vice human nature be susceptible of nor what may be expect of mankind from any great revolution in their education customs or principles machiavel be certainly a great genius but have confine his study to the furious and tyrannical governments of ancient time or to the little disorderly principalities of italy his reason especially upon monarchical government have be find extremely defective and there scarcely be any maxim in his prince which subsequent experience have not entirely refute a weak prince say he be incapable of receive good counsel for if he consult with several he will not be able to choose among their different counsel if he abandon himself to one that minister may perhaps have capacity but he will not long be a minister he will be sure to dispossess his master and place himself and his family upon the throne mention this among many instance of the errors of that politician proceed in a great measure from his have live in too early an age of the world to be a good judge of political truth almost all the princes of europe be at present govern by their minister and have be so for near two centuries and yet no such event have ever happen or can possibly happen sejanus might project dethrone the cæsars but fleury though ever so vicious could not while in his sense entertain the least hop of dispossess the bourbons trade be never esteem an affair of state till the last century and there scarcely be any ancient writer on politics who have make mention of it even the italians have keep a profound silence with regard to it though it have now engage the chief attention as well of minister of state as of speculative reasoners the great opulence grandeur and military achievements of the two maritime power seem first to have instruct mankind in the importance of an extensive commerce have therefore intend in this essay to make a full comparison of civil liberty and absolute government and to showc the great advantage of the former above the latter begin to entertain a suspicion that no man in this age be sufficiently qualify for such an undertake and that whatever any one should advance on that head would in all probability be refute by further experience and be reject by posterity such mighty revolutions have happen in human affairs and so many events have arise contrary to the expectation of the ancients that they be sufficient to beget the suspicion of still further change it have be observe by the ancients that all the arts and sciences arise among free nations and that the persians and egyptians notwithstanding their ease opulence and luxury make but faint efforts towards a relish in those finer pleasures which be carry to such perfection by the greeks amidst continual war attend with poverty and the greatest simplicity of life and manners it have also be observe that when the greeks lose their liberty though they increase mightily in riches by mean of the conquests of alexander yet the arts from that moment decline among them and have never since be able to raise their head in that climate learn be transplant to rome the only free nation at that time in the universe and have meet with so favourable a soil it make prodigious shoot for above a century till the decay of liberty produce also the decay of letter and spread a total barbarism over the world from these two experiment of which each be double in its kind and shew the fall of learn in absolute governments as well as its rise in popular ones longinus think himself sufficiently justify in assert that the arts and sciences could never flourish but in a free government and in this opinion he have be follow by several eminent writers in our own country who either confine their view merely to ancient facts or entertain too great a partiality in favour of that form of government establish amongst us but what would these writers have say to the instance of modern rome and of florence of which the former carry to perfection all the finer arts of sculpture paint and music as well as poetry though it groan under tyranny and under the tyranny of priests while the latter make its chief progress in the arts and sciences after it begin to lose its liberty by the usurpation of the family of medici ariosto tasso galileo more than raphael and michael angelo be not bear in republics and though the lombard school be famous as well as the roman yet the venetians have have the smallest share in its honour and seem rather inferior to the other italians in their genius for the arts and sciences rubens establish his school at antwerp not at amsterdam dresden not hamburgh be the centre of politeness in germany but the most eminent instance of the flourish of learn in absolute governments be that of france which scarcely ever enjoy any establish liberty and yet have carry the arts and sciences as near perfection as any other nation the english be perhaps greater philosophersd the italians better painters and musicians the romans be greater orators but the french be the only people except the greeks who have be at once philosophers poets orators historians painters architects sculptors and musicians with regard to the stage they have excel even the greeks who far excel the englishe and in common life they have in a great measure perfect that art the most useful and agreeable of any lart de vivre the art of society and conversation if we consider the state of the sciences and polite arts in our own country horaces observation with regard to the romans may in a great measure be apply to the british sed in longum tamen ævum manserunt hodieque manent vestigia ruris the elegance and propriety of style have be very much neglect among us we have no dictionary of our language and scarcely a tolerable grammar the first polite prose we have be writ by a man who be still alive as to sprat locke and even temple they know too little of the rule of art to be esteem elegant writers the prose of bacon harrington and milton be altogether stiff and pedantic though their sense be excellent men in this country have be so much occupy in the great dispute of religion politics and philosophy that they have no relish for the seemingly minute observations of grammar and criticism and though this turn of think must have considerably improve our sense and our talent of reason it must be confess that even in those sciences abovementioned we have not any standardbook which we can transmit to posterity and the utmost we have to boast of be a few essay towards a more just philosophy which indeed promise well but have not as yet reach any degree of perfection it have become an establish opinion that commerce can never flourish but in a free government and this opinion seem to be found on a longer and larger experience than the forego with regard to the arts and sciences if we trace commerce in its progress through tyre athens syracuse carthage venice florence genoa antwerp holland england c we shall always find it to have fix its seat in free governments the three greatest trade towns now in europe be london amsterdam and hamburgh all free cities and protestant cities that be enjoy a double liberty it must however be observe that the great jealousy entertain of late with regard to the commerce of france seem to prove that this maxim be no more certain and infallible than the forego and that the subject of an absolute prince may become our rival in commerce as well as in learn durst deliver my opinion in an affair of so much uncertainty would assert that notwithstanding the efforts of the french there be something hurtful to commerce inherent in the very nature of absolute government and inseparable from it though the reason should assign for this opinion be somewhat different from that which be commonly insist on private property seem to me almost as secure in a civilize european monarchy as in a republic nor be danger much apprehend in such a government from the violence of the sovereign more than we commonly dread harm from thunder or earthquakes or any accident the most unusual and extraordinary avarice the spur of industry be so obstinate a passion and work its way through so many real dangers and difficulties that it be not likely to be scar by an imaginary danger which be so small that it scarcely admit of calculation commerce therefore in my opinion be apt to decay in absolute governments not because it be there less secure but because it be less honourable a subordination of rank be absolutely necessary to the support of monarchy birth title and place must be honour above industry and riches and while these notions prevail all the considerable traders will be tempt to throw up their commerce in order to purchase some of those employments to which privilege and honour be annex since be upon this head of the alterations which time have produce or may produce in politics must observe that all kinds of government free and absolute seem to have undergo in modern time a great change for the better with regard both to foreign and domestic management the balance of power be a secret in politics fully know only to the present age and must add that the internal police of state have also receive great improvements within the last century we be inform by sallust that catilines army be much augment by the accession of the highwaymen about rome though believe that all of that profession who be at present disperse over europe would not amount to a regiment in ciceros plead for milo find this argument among others make use of to prove that his client have not assassinate clodius have milo say he intend to have kill clodius he have not attack him in the daytime and at such a distance from the city he have waylay him at night near the suburbs where it might have be pretend that he be kill by robbers and the frequency of the accident would have favour the deceit this be a surprizing proof of the loose police of rome and of the number and force of these robbers since clodius be at that time attend by thirty slave who be completely arm and sufficiently accustom to blood and danger in the frequent tumults excite by that seditious tribunef but though all kinds of government be improve in modern time yet monarchical government seem to have make the greatest advance towards perfection it may now be affirm of civilize monarchies what be formerly say in praise of republics alone that they be a government of laws not of men they be find susceptible of order method and constancy to a surprizing degree property be there secure industry encourage the arts flourish and the prince live secure among his subject like a father among his children there be perhaps and have be for two centuries near two hundred absolute princes great and small in europe and allow twenty years to each reign we may suppose that there have be in the whole two thousand monarchs or tyrants as the greeks would have call them yet of these there have not be one not even philip of spain so bad as tiberius caligula nero or domitian who be four in twelve amongst the roman emperorsg it must however be confess that though monarchical governments have approach nearer to popular ones in gentleness and stability they be still inferior our modern education and customs instil more humanity and moderation than the ancient but have not as yet be able to overcome entirely the disadvantage of that form of government but here must beg leave to advance a conjecture which seem probable but which posterity alone can fully judge of be apt to think that in monarchical governments there be a source of improvement and in popular governments a source of degeneracy which in time will bring these species of civil polity still nearer an equality the greatest abuse which arise in france the most perfect model of pure monarchy proceed not from the number or weight of the tax beyond what be to be meet with in free countries but from the expensive unequal arbitrary and intricate method of levy them by which the industry of the poor especially of the peasants and farmers be in a great measure discourage and agriculture render a beggarly and slavish employment but to whose advantage do these abuse tend if to that of the nobility they might be esteem inherent in that form of government since the nobility be the true support of monarchy and it be natural their interest should be more consult in such a constitution than that of the people but the nobility be in reality the chief losers by this oppression since it ruin their estates and beggar their tenant the only gainers by it be the finançiersh a race of men rather odious to the nobility and the whole kingdom if a prince or minister therefore should arise endow with sufficient discernment to know his own and the public interest and with sufficient force of mind to break through ancient customs we might expect to see these abuse remedied in which case the difference between that absolute government and our free one would not appear so considerable as at present the source of degeneracy which may be remark in free governments consist in the practice of contract debt and mortgage the public revenues by which tax may in time become altogether intolerable and all the property of the state be bring into the hand of the public this practice be of modern date the atheniansi though govern by a republic pay near two hundred per cent for those sum of money which any emergence make it necessary for them to borrow as we learn from xenophon among the moderns the dutch first introduce the practice of borrow great sum at low interest and have well nigh ruin themselves by it absolute princes have also contract debt but as an absolute prince may make a bankruptcy when he please his people can never be oppress by his debts in popular governments the people and chiefly those who have the highest offices be commonly the public creditors it be difficult for the state to make use of this remedy which however it may sometimes be necessary be always cruel and barbarous this therefore seem to be an inconvenience which nearly threaten all free governments especially our own at the present juncture of affairs and what a strong motive be this to encrease our frugality of public money lest for want of it we be reduce by the multiplicity of tax or what be worse by our public impotence and inability for defence to curse our very liberty and wish ourselves in the same state of servitude with all the nations that surround us essay of eloquence those who consider the periods and revolutions of human kind as represent in history be entertain with a spectacle full of pleasure and variety and see with surprize the manners customs and opinions of the same species susceptible of such prodigious change in different periods of time it may however be observe that in civil history there be find a much greater uniformity than in the history of learn and science and that the war negociations and politics of one age resemble more those of another than the taste wit and speculative principles interest and ambition honour and shame friendship and enmity gratitude and revenge be the prime movers in all public transactions and these passions be of a very stubborn and intractable nature in comparison of the sentiments and understand which be easily vary by education and example the goths be much more inferior to the romans in taste and science than in courage and virtue but not to compare together nations so widely differenta it may be observe that even this later period of human learn be in many respect of an opposite character to the ancient and that if we be superior in philosophy we be still notwithstanding all our refinements much inferior in eloquence in ancient time no work of genius be think to require so great part and capacity as the speak in public and some eminent writers have pronounce the talents even of a great poet or philosopher to be of an inferior nature to those which be requisite for such an undertake greece and rome produce each of them but one accomplish orator and whatever praise the other celebrate speakers might merit they be still esteem much inferior to these great model of eloquence it be observable that the ancient critics could scarcely find two orators in any age who deserve to be place precisely in the same rank and possess the same degree of merit calvus cælius curio hortensius cæsar rise one above another but the greatest of that age be inferior to cicero the most eloquent speaker that have ever appear in rome those of fine taste however pronounce this judgment of the roman orator as well as of the grecian that both of them surpass in eloquence all that have ever appear but that they be far from reach the perfection of their art which be infinite and not only exceed human force to attain but human imagination to conceive cicero declare himself dissatisfy with his own performances nay even with those of demosthenes ita sunt avidæ capaces meæ aures say he semper aliquid immensum infinitumque desiderant b of all the polite and learn nations england alone possess a popular government or admit into the legislature such numerous assemblies as can be suppose to lie under the dominion of eloquence but what have england to boast of in this particular in enumerate the great men who have do honour to our country we exult in our poets and philosophers but what orators be ever mention or where be the monuments of their genius to be meet with there be find indeed in our histories the name of several who direct the resolutions of our parliament but neither themselves nor others have take the pain to preserve their speeches and the authority which they possess seem to have be owe to their experience wisdom or power more than to their talents for oratory at present there be above half a dozen speakers in the two house who in the judgment of the public have reach very near the same pitch of eloquence and no man pretend to give any one the preference above the rest this seem to me a certain proof that none of them have attain much beyond a mediocrity in their art and that the species of eloquence which they aspire to give no exercise to the sublimer faculties of the mind but may be reach by ordinary talents and a slight application a hundred cabinetmakers in london can work a table or a chair equally well but no one poet can write verse with such spirit and elegance as mr pope we be tell that when demosthenes be to plead all ingenious men flock to athens from the most remote part of greece as to the most celebrate spectacle of the world at london you may see men saunter in the court of request while the most important debate be carry on in the two house and many do not think themselves sufficiently compensate for the lose of their dinners by all the eloquence of our most celebrate speakers when old cibber be to act the curiosity of several be more excite than when our prime minister be to defend himself from a motion for his removal or impeachment even a person unacquainted with the noble remain of ancient orators may judge from a few stroke that the stile or species of their eloquence be infinitely more sublime than that which modern orators aspire to how absurd would it appear in our temperate and calm speakers to make use of an apostrophe like that noble one of demosthenes so much celebrate by quintilian and longinus when justify the unsuccessful battle of chæronea he break out no my fellowcitizens no you have not err swear by the man of those heroes who fight for the same cause in the plain ofmarathon and platæa who could now endure such a bold and poetical figure as that which cicero employ after describe in the most tragical term the crucifixion of a roman citizen should paint the horrors of this scene not toromancitizens not to the ally of our state not to those who have ever hear of theromanname not even to men but to brutecreatures or to go farther should lift up my voice in the most desolate solitude to the rock and mountains yet should surely see those rude and inanimate part of nature move with horror and indignation at the recital of so enormous an action with what a blaze of eloquence must such a sentence be surround to give it grace or cause it to make any impression on the hearers and what noble art and sublime talents be requisite to arrive by just degrees at a sentiment so bold and excessive to inflame the audience so as to make them accompany the speaker in such violent passions and such elevate conceptions and to conceal under a torrent of eloquence the artifice by which all this be effectuate should this sentiment even appear to us excessive as perhaps it justly may it will at least serve to give an idea of the stile of ancient eloquence where such swell expressions be not reject as wholly monstrous and giganticc suitable to this vehemence of think and expression be the vehemence of action observe in the ancient orators the supplosio pedis or stamp with the foot be one of the most usual and moderate gesture which they make use of though that be now esteem too violent either for the senate bar or pulpit and be only admit into the theatre to accompany the most violent passions which be there represent one be somewhat at a loss to what cause we may ascribe so sensible a decline of eloquence in later age the genius of mankind at all time be perhaps equal the moderns have apply themselves with great industry and success to all the other arts and sciences and a learn nation possess a popular government a circumstance which seem requisite for the full display of these noble talents but notwithstanding all these advantage our progress in eloquence be very inconsiderable in comparison of the advance which we have make in all other part of learn shall we assert that the strain of ancient eloquence be unsuitable to our age and ought not to be imitate by modern orators whatever reason may be make use of to prove this be persuade they will be find upon examination to be unsound and unsatisfactory first it may be say that in ancient time during the flourish period of greek and roman learn the municipal laws in every state be but few and simple and the decision of cause be in a great measure leave to the equity and common sense of the judge the study of the laws be not then a laborious occupation require the drudgery of a whole life to finish it and incompatible with every other study or profession the great statesmen and general among the romans be all lawyers and cicero to shew the facility of acquire this science declare that in the midst of all his occupations he would undertake in a few days to make himself a complete civilian now where a pleader address himself to the equity of his judge he have much more room to display his eloquence than where he must draw his arguments from strict laws statutes and precedents in the former case many circumstances must be take in many personal considerations regard and even favour and inclination which it belong to the orator by his art and eloquence to conciliate may be disguise under the appearance of equity but how shall a modern lawyer have leisure to quit his toilsome occupations in order to gather the flower of parnassus or what opportunity shall he have of display them amidst the rigid and subtile arguments objections and reply which he be oblige to make use of the greatest genius and greatest orator who should pretend to plead before the chancellor after a months study of the laws would only labour to make himself ridiculous be ready to own that this circumstance of the multiplicity and intricacy of laws be a discouragement to eloquence in modern time but assert that it will not entirely account for the decline of that noble art it may banish oratory from westminsterhall but not from either house of parliament among the athenians the areopagites expressly forbid all allurements of eloquence and some have pretend that in the greek orations write in the judiciary form there be not so bold and rhetorical a stile as appear in the roman but to what a pitch do the athenians carry their eloquence in the deliberative kind when affairs of state be canvass and the liberty happiness and honour of the republic be the subject of debate dispute of this nature elevate the genius above all others and give the fullest scope to eloquence and such dispute be very frequent in this nation secondly it may be pretend that the decline of eloquence be owe to the superior good sense of the moderns who reject with disdain all those rhetorical trick employ to seduce the judge and will admit of nothing but solid argument in any debate or deliberation if a man be accuse of murder the fact must be prove by witness and evidence and the laws will afterwards determine the punishment of the criminal it would be ridiculous to describe in strong colour the horror and cruelty of the action to introduce the relations of the dead and at a signal make them throw themselves at the feet of the judge implore justice with tear and lamentations and still more ridiculous would it be to employ a picture represent the bloody deed in order to move the judge by the display of so tragical a spectacle though we know that this artifice be sometimes practise by the pleaders of old now banish the pathetic from public discourse and you reduce the speakers merely to modern eloquence that be to good sense deliver in proper expression perhaps it may be acknowledge that our modern customs or our superior good sense if you will should make our orators more cautious and reserve than the ancient in attempt to inflame the passions or elevate the imagination of their audience but see no reason why it should make them despair absolutely of succeed in that attempt it should make them redouble their art not abandon it entirely the ancient orators seem also to have be on their guard against this jealousy of their audience but they take a different way of elude it they hurry away with such a torrent of sublime and pathetic that they leave their hearers no leisure to perceive the artifice by which they be deceive nay to consider the matter aright they be not deceive by any artifice the orator by the force of his own genius and eloquence first inflame himself with anger indignation pity sorrow and then communicate those impetuous movements to his audience do any man pretend to have more good sense than julius cæsar yet that haughty conqueror we know be so subdue by the charm of ciceros eloquence that he be in a manner constrain to change his settle purpose and resolution and to absolve a criminal whom before that orator plead he be determine to condemn d some objections own notwithstanding his vast success may lie against some passages of the roman orator he be too florid and rhetorical his figure be too strike and palpable the divisions of his discourse be draw chiefly from the rule of the school and his wit disdain not always the artifice even of a pun rhyme or jingle of word the grecian address himself to an audience much less refine than the roman senate or judge the lowest vulgar of athens be his sovereigns and the arbiters of his eloquence yet be his manner more chaste and austere than that of the other could it be copy its success would be infallible over a modern assembly it be rapid harmony exactly adjust to the sense it be vehement reason without any appearance of art it be disdain anger boldness freedom involve in a continue stream of argument and of all human productions the orations of demosthenes present to us the model which approach the nearest to perfectiond thirdly it may be pretend that the disorder of the ancient governments and the enormous crimes of which the citizens be often guilty afford much ampler matter for eloquence than can be meet with among the moderns be there no verres or catiline there would be no cicero but that this reason can have no great influence be evident it would be easy to find a philip in modern time but where shall we find a demosthenes what remain then but that we lay the blame on the want of genius or of judgment in our speakers who either find themselves incapable of reach the heights of ancient eloquence or reject all such endeavour as unsuitable to the spirit of modern assemblies a few successful attempt of this nature might rouze the genius of the nation excite the emulation of the youth and accustom our ears to a more sublime and more pathetic elocution than what we have be hitherto entertain with there be certainly something accidental in the first rise and the progress of the arts in any nation doubt whether a very satisfactory reason can be give why ancient rome though it receive all its refinements from greece could attain only to a relish for statuary paint and architecture without reach the practice of these arts while modern rome have be excite by a few remain find among the ruin of antiquity and have produce artists of the greatest eminence and distinction have such a cultivate genius for oratory as wallerse for poetry arise during the civil war when liberty begin to be fully establish and popular assemblies to enter into all the most material point of government be persuade so illustrious an example would have give a quite different turn to british eloquence and make us reach the perfection of the ancient model our orators would then have do honour to their country as well as our poets geometers and philosophers and british ciceros have appear as well as british archimedesesf and virgils g it be seldom or never find when a false taste in poetry or eloquence prevail among any people that it have be prefer to a true upon comparison and reflection it commonly prevail merely from ignorance of the true and from the want of perfect model to lead men into a juster apprehension and more refine relish of those productions of genius when these appear they soon unite all suffrages in their favour and by their natural and powerful charm gain over even the most prejudice to the love and admiration of them the principles of every passion and of every sentiment be in every man and when touch properly they rise to life and warm the heart and convey that satisfaction by which a work of genius be distinguish from the adulterate beauties of a capricious wit and fancy and if this observation be true with regard to all the liberal arts it must be peculiarly so with regard to eloquence which be merely calculate for the public and for men of the world can not with any pretence of reason appeal from the people to more refine judge but must submit to the public verdict without reserve or limitation whoever upon comparison be deem by a common audience the greatest orator ought most certainly to be pronounce such by men of science and erudition and though an indifferent speaker may triumph for a long time and be esteem altogether perfect by the vulgar who be satisfy with his accomplishments and know not in what he be defective yet whenever the true genius arise he draw to him the attention of every one and immediately appear superior to his rival now to judge by this rule ancient eloquence that be the sublime and passionate be of a much juster taste than the modern or the argumentative and rational and if properly execute will always have more command and authority over mankind we be satisfy with our mediocrity because we have have no experience of any thing better but the ancients have experience of both and upon comparison give the preference to that kind of which they have leave us such applaud model for if mistake not our modern eloquence be of the same stile or species with that which ancient critics denominate attic eloquence that be calm elegant and subtile which instruct the reason more than affect the passions and never raise its tone above argument or common discourse such be the eloquence of lysias among the athenians and of calvus among the romans these be esteem in their time but when compare with demosthenes and cicero be eclipse like a taper when set in the ray of a meridian sun those latter orators possess the same elegance and subtilty and force of argument with the former but what render them chiefly admirable be that pathetic and sublime which on proper occasion they throw into their discourse and by which they command the resolution of their audience of this species of eloquence we have scarcely have any instance in england at least in our public speakers in our writers we have have some instance which have meet with great applause and might assure our ambitious youth of equal or superior glory in attempt for the revival of ancient eloquence lord bolingbrokes productions with all their defect in argument method and precisionh contain a force and energy which our orators scarcely ever aim at though it be evident that such an elevate stile have much better grace in a speaker than in a writer and be assure of more prompt and more astonish success it be there second by the grace of voice and action the movements be mutually communicate between the orator and the audience and the very aspect of a large assembly attentive to the discourse of one man must inspire him with a peculiar elevation sufficient to give a propriety to the strongest figure and expressions it be true there be a great prejudice against set speeches and a man can not escape ridicule who repeat a discourse as a schoolboy do his lesson and take no notice of any thing that have be advance in the course of the debate but where be the necessity of fall into this absurdity a public speaker must know beforehand the question under debate he may compose all the arguments objections and answer such as he think will be most proper for his discourse if any thing new occur he may supply it from his invention nor will the difference be very apparent between his elaborate and his extemporary compositions the mind naturally continue with the same impetus or force which it have acquire by its motion as a vessel once impel by the oars carry on its course for some time when the original impulse be suspend shall conclude this subject with observe that even though our modern orators should not elevate their stile or aspire to a rivalship with the ancient yet be there in most of their speeches a material defect which they might correct without depart from that compose air of argument and reason to which they limit their ambition their great affectation of extemporary discourse have make them reject all order and method which seem so requisite to argument and without which it be scarcely possible to produce an entire conviction on the mind it be not that one would recommend many divisions in a public discourse unless the subject very evidently offer them but it be easy without this formality to observe a method and make that method conspicuous to the hearers who will be infinitely please to see the arguments rise naturally from one another and will retain a more thorough persuasion than can arise from the strongest reason which be throw together in confusion essay of the rise and progress of the arts and sciences nothing require greater nicety in our enquiries concern human affairs than to distinguish exactly what be owe to chance and what proceed from cause nor be there any subject in which an author be more liable to deceive himself by false subtilties and refinements to say that any event be derive from chance cut short all farther enquiry concern it and leave the writer in the same state of ignorance with the rest of mankind but when the event be suppose to proceed from certain and stable cause he may then display his ingenuity in assign these cause and as a man of any subtilty can never be at a loss in this particular he have thereby an opportunity of swell his volumes and discover his profound knowledge in observe what escape the vulgar and ignorant the distinguish between chance and cause must depend upon every particular man sagacity in consider every particular incident but if be to assign any general rule to help us in apply this distinction it would be the follow what depend upon a few persons be in a great measure to be ascribe to chance or secret and unknown cause what arise from a great number may often be account for by determinate and know cause two natural reason may be assign for this rule first if you suppose a dye to have any bias however small to a particular side this bias though perhaps it may not appear in a few throw will certainly prevail in a great number and will cast the balance entirely to that side in like manner when any cause beget a particular inclination or passion at a certain time and among a certain people though many individuals may escape the contagion and be rule by passions peculiar to themselves yet the multitude will certainly be seize by the common affection and be govern by it in all their action secondly those principles or cause which be fit to operate on a multitude be always of a grosser and more stubborn nature less subject to accidents and less influence by whim and private fancy than those which operate on a few only the latter be commonly so delicate and refine that the smallest incident in the health education or fortune of a particular person be sufficient to divert their course and retard their operation nor be it possible to reduce them to any general maxims or observations their influence at one time will never assure us concern their influence at another even though all the general circumstances should be the same in both case to judge by this rule the domestic and the gradual revolutions of a state must be a more proper subject of reason and observation than the foreign and the violent which be commonly produce by single persons and be more influence by whim folly or caprice than by general passions and interest the depression of the lord and rise of the commons in england after the statutes of alienation and the encrease of trade and industry be more easily account for by general principles than the depression of the spanish and rise of the french monarchy after the death of charles quint have harry cardinal richlieu and louis be spaniards and philip and and charles be frenchmen the history of these two nations have be entirely reverse for the same reason it be more easy to account for the rise and progress of commerce in any kingdom than for that of learn and a state which should apply itself to the encouragement of the one would be more assure of success than one which should cultivate the other avarice or the desire of gain be an universal passion which operate at all time in all place and upon all persons but curiosity or the love of knowledge have a very limit influence and require youth leisure education genius and example to make it govern any person you will never want booksellers while there be buyers of book but there may frequently be readers where there be no author multitudes of people necessity and liberty have beget commerce in holland but study and application have scarcely produce any eminent writers we may therefore conclude that there be no subject in which we must proceed with more caution than in trace the history of the arts and sciences lest we assign cause which never exist and reduce what be merely contingent to stable and universal principles those who cultivate the sciences in any state be always few in number the passion which govern them limit their taste and judgment delicate and easily pervert and their application disturb with the smallest accident chance therefore or secret and unknown cause must have a great influence on the rise and progress of all the refine arts but there be a reason which induce me not to ascribe the matter altogether to chance though the persons who cultivate the sciences with such astonish success as to attract the admiration of posterity be always few in all nations and all age it be impossible but a share of the same spirit and genius must be antecedently diffuse throughout the people among whom they arise in order to produce form and cultivate from their earliest infancy the taste and judgment of those eminent writers the mass can not be altogether insipid from which such refine spirit be extract there be a god within us say ovid who breathe that divine fire by which we be animate poets in all age have advance this claim to inspiration there be not however any thing supernatural in the case their fire be not kindle from heaven it only run along the earth be catch from one breast to another and burn brightest where the materials be best prepare and most happily dispose the question therefore concern the rise and progress of the arts and sciences be not altogether a question concern the taste genius and spirit of a few but concern those of a whole people and may therefore be account for in some measure by general cause and principles grant that a man who should enquire why such a particular poet as homer for instance exist at such a place in such a time would throw himself headlong into chimæra and could never treat of such a subject without a multitude of false subtilties and refinements he might as well pretend to give a reason why such particular general as fabius and scipio live in rome at such a time and why fabius come into the world before scipio for such incidents as these no other reason can be give than that of horace scit genius natale come qui temperat astrum naturæ deus humanæ mortalis in unum quodque caput vultu mutabilis albus ater but be persuade that in many case good reason might be give why such a nation be more polite and learn at a particular time than any of its neighbour at least this be so curious a subject that it be a pity to abandon it entirely before we have find whether it be susceptible of reason and can be reduce to any general principlesa my first observation on this head be that it be impossible for the arts and sciences to arise at first among any people unless that people enjoy the bless of a free government in the first age of the world when men be as yet barbarous and ignorant they seek no farther security against mutual violence and injustice than the choice of some rulers few or many in whom they place an implicit confidence without provide any security by laws or political institutions against the violence and injustice of these rulers if the authority be center in a single person and if the people either by conquest or by the ordinary course of propagation encrease to a great multitude the monarch find it impossible in his own person to execute every office of sovereignty in every place must delegate his authority to inferior magistrates who preserve peace and order in their respective district as experience and education have not yet refine the judgments of men to any considerable degree the prince who be himself unrestrained never dream of restrain his minister but delegate his full authority to every one whom he set over any portion of the people all general laws be attend with inconveniencies when apply to particular case and it require great penetration and experience both to perceive that these inconveniencies be fewer than what result from full discretionary power in every magistrate and also to discern what general laws be upon the whole attend with fewest inconveniencies this be a matter of so great difficulty that men may have make some advance even in the sublime arts of poetry and eloquence where a rapidity of genius and imagination assist their progress before they have arrive at any great refinement in their municipal laws where frequent trials and diligent observation can alone direct their improvements it be not therefore to be suppose that a barbarous monarch unrestrained and uninstructed will ever become a legislator or think of restrain his bashaws in every province or even his cadis in every village we be tell that the late czar though actuate with a noble genius and smite with the love and admiration of european arts yet profess an esteem for the turkish policy in this particular and approve of such summary decisions of cause as be practise in that barbarous monarchy where the judge be not restrain by any methods form or laws he do not perceive how contrary such a practice would have be to all his other endeavour for refine his people arbitrary power in all case be somewhat oppressive and debase but it be altogether ruinous and intolerable when contract into a small compass and become still worse when the person who possess it know that the time of his authority be limit and uncertain habet subjectos tanquam suos viles ut alienos he govern the subject with full authority as if they be his own and with negligence or tyranny as belong to another a people govern after such a manner be slave in the full and proper sense of the word and it be impossible they can ever aspire to any refinements of taste or reason they dare not so much as pretend to enjoy the necessaries of life in plenty or security to expect therefore that the arts and sciences should take their first rise in a monarchy be to expect a contradiction before these refinements have take place the monarch be ignorant and uninstructed and not have knowledge sufficient to make him sensible of the necessity of balance his government upon general laws he delegate his full power to all inferior magistrates this barbarous policy debase the people and for ever prevent all improvements be it possible that before science be know in the world a monarch could possess so much wisdom as to become a legislator and govern his people by law not by the arbitrary will of their fellowsubjects it might be possible for that species of government to be the first nursery of arts and sciences but that supposition seem scarcely to be consistent or rational it may happen that a republic in its infant state may be support by as few laws as a barbarous monarchy and may entrust as unlimited an authority to its magistrates or judge but besides that the frequent elections by the people be a considerable check upon authority it be impossible but in time the necessity of restrain the magistrates in order to preserve liberty must at last appear and give rise to general laws and statutes the roman consuls for some time decide all cause without be confine by any positive statutes till the people bear this yoke with impatience create the decemvirs who promulgate the twelve table a body of laws which though perhaps they be not equal in bulk to one english act of parliament be almost the only write rule which regulate property and punishment for some age in that famous republic they be however sufficient together with the form of a free government to secure the live and properties of the citizens to exempt one man from the dominion of another and to protect every one against the violence or tyranny of his fellowcitizens in such a situation the sciences may raise their head and flourish but never can have be amidst such a scene of oppression and slavery as always result from barbarous monarchies where the people alone be restrain by the authority of the magistrates and the magistrates be not restrain by any law or statute an unlimited despotism of this nature while it exist effectually put a stop to all improvements and keep men from attain that knowledge which be requisite to instruct them in the advantage arise from a better police and more moderate authority here then be the advantage of free state though a republic should be barbarous it necessarily by an infallible operation give rise to law even before mankind have make any considerable advance in the other sciences from law arise security from security curiosity and from curiosity knowledge the latter step of this progress may be more accidental but the former be altogether necessary a republic without laws can never have any duration on the contrary in a monarchical government law arise not necessarily from the form of government monarchy when absolute contain even something repugnant to law great wisdom and reflexion can alone reconcile them but such a degree of wisdom can never be expect before the greater refinements and improvements of human reason these refinements require curiosity security and law the first growth therefore of the arts and sciences can never be expect in despotic governmentsb there be other cause which discourage the rise of the refine arts in despotic governments though take the want of laws and the delegation of full power to every petty magistrate to be the principal eloquence certainly spring up more naturally in popular governments emulation too in every accomplishment must there be more animate and enliven and genius and capacity have a fuller scope and career all these cause render free governments the only proper nursery for the arts and sciences the next observation which shall make on this head be that nothing be more favourable to the rise of politeness and learn than a number of neighbour and independent state connect together by commerce and policy the emulation which naturally arise among those neighbour state be an obvious source of improvement but what would chiefly insist on be the stop which such limit territories give both to power and to authority extend governments where a single person have great influence soon become absolute but small ones change naturally into commonwealths a large government be accustom by degrees to tyranny because each act of violence be at first perform upon a part which be distant from the majority be not take notice of nor excite any violent ferment besides a large government though the whole be discontent may by a little art be keep in obedience while each part ignorant of the resolutions of the rest be afraid to begin any commotion or insurrection not to mention that there be a superstitious reverence for princes which mankind naturally contract when they do not often see the sovereign and when many of them become not acquaint with him so as to perceive his weaknesses and as large state can afford a great expence in order to support the pomp of majesty this be a kind of fascination on men and naturally contribute to the enslave of them in a small government any act of oppression be immediately know throughout the whole the murmur and discontent proceed from it be easily communicate and the indignation arise the higher because the subject be not apt to apprehend in such state that the distance be very wide between themselves and their sovereign no man say the prince of conde be a hero to his valet de chambre it be certain that admiration and acquaintance be altogether incompatible towards any mortal creaturec sleep and love convince even alexander himself that he be not a god but suppose that such as daily attend him could easily from the numberless weaknesses to which he be subject have give him many still more convince proof of his humanity but the divisions into small state be favourable to learn by stop the progress of authority as well as that of power reputation be often as great a fascination upon men as sovereignty and be equally destructive to the freedom of think and examination but where a number of neighbour state have a great intercourse of arts and commerce their mutual jealousy keep them from receive too lightly the law from each other in matter of taste and of reason and make them examine every work of art with the greatest care and accuracy the contagion of popular opinion spread not so easily from one place to another it readily receive a check in some state or other where it concur not with the prevail prejudice and nothing but nature and reason or at least what bear them a strong resemblanced can force its way through all obstacles and unite the most rival nations into an esteem and admiration of it greece be a cluster of little principalities which soon become republics and be unite both by their near neighbourhood and by the tie of the same language and interest they enter into the closest intercourse of commerce and learn there concur a happy climate a soil not unfertile and a most harmonious and comprehensive language so that every circumstance among that people seem to favour the rise of the arts and sciences each city produce its several artists and philosophers who refuse to yield the preference to those of the neighbour republics their contention and debate sharpen the wits of men a variety of object be present to the judgment while each challenge the preference to the rest and the sciences not be dwarf by the restraint of authority be enable to make such considerable shoot as be even at this time the object of our admiration after the romanchristian or catholic church have spread itself over the civilize world and have engross all the learn of the time be really one large state within itself and unite under one head this variety of sects immediately disappear and the peripatetic philosophy be alone admit into all the school to the utter depravation of every kind of learn but mankind have at length throw off this yoke affairs be now return nearly to the same situation as before and europe be at present a copy at large of what greece be formerly a pattern in miniature we have see the advantage of this situation in several instance what check the progress of the cartesian philosophy to which the french nation shew such a strong propensity towards the end of the last century but the opposition make to it by the other nations of europe who soon discover the weak side of that philosophy the severest scrutiny which newtons theory have undergo proceed not from his own countrymen but from foreigners and if it can overcome the obstacles which it meet with at present in all part of europe it will probably go down triumphant to the latest posterity the english be become sensible of the scandalous licentiousness of their stage from the example of the french decency and morals the french be convince that their theatre have become somewhat effeminate by too much love and gallantry and begin to approve of the more masculine taste of some neighbour nations in china there seem to be a pretty considerable stock of politeness and science which in the course of so many centuries might naturally be expect to ripen into something more perfect and finish than what have yet arise from them but china be one vast empire speak one language govern by one law and sympathize in the same manners the authority of any teacher such as confucius be propagate easily from one corner of the empire to the other none have courage to resist the torrent of popular opinion and posterity be not bold enough to dispute what have be universally receive by their ancestors this seem to be one natural reason why the sciences have make so slow a progress in that mighty empire if we consider the face of the globe europe of all the four part of the world be the most break by seas rivers and mountains and greece of all countries of europe hence these regions be naturally divide into several distinct governments and hence the sciences arise in greece and europe have be hitherto the most constant habitation of them have sometimes be incline to think that interruptions in the periods of learn be they not attend with such a destruction of ancient book and the record of history would be rather favourable to the arts and sciences by break the progress of authority and dethrone the tyrannical usurpers over human reason in this particular they have the same influence as interruptions in political governments and societies consider the blind submission of the ancient philosophers to the several master in each school and you will be convince that little good could be expect from a hundred centuries of such a servile philosophy even the eclectics who arise about the age of augustus notwithstanding their profess to chuse freely what please them from every different sect be yet in the main as slavish and dependent as any of their brethren since they seek for truth not in nature but in the several school where they suppose she must necessarily be find though not unite in a body yet disperse in part upon the revival of learn those sects of stoics and epicureans platonists and pythagoricians could never regain any credit or authority and at the same time by the example of their fall keep men from submit with such blind deference to those new sects which have attempt to gain an ascendant over them the third observation which shall form on this head of the rise and progress of the arts and sciences be that though the only proper nursery of these noble plant be a free state yet may they be transplant into any government and that a republic be most favourable to the growth of the sciences a civilize monarchy to that of the polite arts to balance a large state or society whether monarchical or republican on general laws be a work of so great difficulty that no human genius however comprehensive be able by the mere dint of reason and reflection to effect it the judgments of many must unite in this work experience must guide their labour time must bring it to perfection and the feel of inconveniencies must correct the mistake which they inevitably fall into in their first trials and experiment hence appear the impossibility that this undertake should be begin and carry on in any monarchy since such a form of government ere civilize know no other secret or policy than that of entrust unlimited power to every governor or magistrate and subdivide the people into so many class and order of slavery from such a situation no improvement can ever be expect in the sciences in the liberal arts in laws and scarcely in the manual arts and manufacture the same barbarism and ignorance with which the government commence be propagate to all posterity and can never come to a period by the efforts or ingenuity of such unhappy slave but though law the source of all security and happiness arise late in any government and be the slow product of order and of liberty it be not preserve with the same difficulty with which it be produce but when it have once take root be a hardy plant which will scarcely ever perish through the ill culture of men or the rigour of the season the arts of luxury and much more the liberal arts which depend on a refine taste or sentiment be easily lose because they be always relish by a few only whose leisure fortune and genius fit them for such amusements but what be profitable to every mortal and in common life when once discover can scarcely fall into oblivion but by the total subversion of society and by such furious inundations of barbarous invaders as obliterate all memory of former arts and civility imitation also be apt to transport these coarser and more useful arts from one climate to another and make them precede the refine arts in their progress though perhaps they spring after them in their first rise and propagation from these cause proceed civilize monarchies where the arts of government first invent in free state be preserve to the mutual advantage and security of sovereign and subject however perfect therefore the monarchical form may appear to some politicians it owe all its perfection to the republican nor be it possible that a pure despotism establish among a barbarous people can ever by its native force and energy refine and polish itself it must borrow its laws and methods and institutions and consequently its stability and order from free governments these advantage be the sole growth of republics the extensive despotism of a barbarous monarchy by enter into the detail of the government as well as into the principal point of administration for ever prevent all such improvements in a civilize monarchy the prince alone be unrestrained in the exercise of his authority and possess alone a power which be not bound by any thing but custom example and the sense of his own interest every minister or magistrate however eminent must submit to the general laws which govern the whole society and must exert the authority delegate to him after the manner which be prescribe the people depend on none but their sovereign for the security of their property he be so far remove from them and be so much exempt from private jealousies or interest that this dependence be scarcely felt and thus a species of government arise to which in a high political rant we may give the name of tyranny but which by a just and prudent administration may afford tolerable security to the people and may answer most of the end of political society but though in a civilize monarchy as well as in a republic the people have security for the enjoyment of their property yet in both these form of government those who possess the supreme authority have the disposal of many honour and advantage which excite the ambition and avarice of mankind the only difference be that in a republic the candidates for office must look downwards to gain the suffrages of the people in a monarchy they must turn their attention upwards to court the good grace and favour of the great to be successful in the former way it be necessary for a man to make himself useful by his industry capacity or knowledge to be prosperous in the latter way it be requisite for him to render himself agreeable by his wit complaisance or civility a strong genius succeed best in republics a refine taste in monarchies and consequently the sciences be the more natural growth of the one and the polite arts of the other not to mention that monarchies receive their chief stability from a superstitious reverence to priests and princes have commonly abridge the liberty of reason with regard to religion and politics and consequently metaphysics and morals all these form the most considerable branch of science mathematics and natural philosophy which only remain be not half so valuablee among the arts of conversation no one please more than mutual deference or civility which lead us to resign our own inclinations to those of our companion and to curb and conceal that presumption and arrogance so natural to the human mind a goodnatured man who be well educate practise this civility to every mortal without premeditation or interest but in order to render that valuable quality general among any people it seem necessary to assist the natural disposition by some general motive where power rise upwards from the people to the great as in all republics such refinements of civility be apt to be little practise since the whole state be by that mean bring near to a level and every member of it be render in a great measure independent of another the people have the advantage by the authority of their suffrages the great by the superiority of their station but in a civilize monarchy there be a long train of dependence from the prince to the peasant which be not great enough to render property precarious or depress the mind of the people but be sufficient to beget in every one an inclination to please his superiors and to form himself upon those model which be most acceptable to people of condition and education politeness of manners therefore arise most naturally in monarchies and court and where that flourish none of the liberal arts will be altogether neglect or despise the republics in europe be at present note for want of politeness the goodmanners of aswisscivilized inholland be an expression for rusticity among the french the english in some degree fall under the same censure notwithstanding their learn and genius and if the venetians be an exception to the rule they owe it perhaps to their communication with the other italians most of whose governments beget a dependence more than sufficient for civilize their manners it be difficult to pronounce any judgment concern the refinements of the ancient republics in this particular but be apt to suspect that the arts of conversation be not bring so near to perfection among them as the arts of write and composition the scurrility of the ancient orators in many instance be quite shock and exceed all belief vanity too be often not a little offensive in author of those age as well as the common licentiousness and immodesty of their stile quicunque impudicus adulter ganeo manu ventre pene bona patria laceraverat say sallust in one of the gravest and most moral passages of his historynam fuit ante helenam cunnus teterrima belli causa be an expression of horace in trace the origin of moral good and evilovid and lucretius be almost as licentious in their stile as lord rochester though the former be fine gentlemen and delicate writers and the latterg from the corruptions of that court in which he live seem to have throw off all regard to shame and decency juvenal inculcate modesty with great zeal but set a very bad example of it if we consider the impudence of his expressions shall also be bold to affirm that among the ancients there be not much delicacy of breed or that polite deference and respect which civility oblige us either to express or counterfeit towards the persons with whom we converse cicero be certainly one of the finest gentlemen of his age yet must confess have frequently be shock with the poor figure under which he represent his friend atticus in those dialogues where he himself be introduce as a speaker that learn and virtuous roman whose dignity though he be only a private gentleman be inferior to that of no one in rome be there shew in rather a more pitiful light than philalethess friend in our modern dialogues he be a humble admirer of the orator pay him frequent compliment and receive his instructions with all the deference which a scholar owe to his master even cato be treat in somewhat of a cavalier manner in the dialogues de finibus h one of the most particular detail of a real dialogue which we meet with in antiquity be relate by polybius when philip king of macedon a prince of wit and part meet with titus flamininus one of the politest of the romans as we learn from plutarch accompany with ambassadors from almost all the greek cities the ætolian ambassador very abruptly tell the king that he talk like a fool or a madman ληρειν thats evident say his majesty even to a blind man which be a raillery on the blindness of his excellency yet all this do not pass the usual bound for the conference be not disturb and flamininus be very well divert with these stroke of humour at the end when philip crave a little time to consult with his friends of whom he have none present the roman general be desirous also to shew his wit as the historian say tell him that perhaps the reason why he have none of his friends with him be because he have murder them all which be actually the case this unprovoked piece of rusticity be not condemn by the historian cause no farther resentment in philip than to excite a sardonian smile or what we call a grin and hinder him not from renew the conference next day plutarch too mention this raillery amongst the witty and agreeable say of flamininusi j cardinal wolsey apologize for his famous piece of insolence in say ego et rex meus and my king by observe that this expression be conformable to the latin idiom and that a roman always name himself before the person to whom or of whom he spake yet this seem to have be an instance of want of civility among that people the ancients make it a rule that the person of the greatest dignity should be mention first in the discourse insomuch that we find the spring of a quarrel and jealousy between the romans and ætolians to have be a poets name the ætolians before the romans in celebrate a victory gain by their unite arm over the macedonians thus livia disgust tiberius by place her own name before his in an inscription k no advantage in this world be pure and unmixed in like manner as modern politeness which be naturally so ornamental run often into affectation and foppery disguise and insincerity so the ancient simplicity which be naturally so amiable and affect often degenerate into rusticity and abuse scurrility and obscenity if the superiority in politeness should be allow to modern time the modern notions of gallantry the natural produce of court and monarchies will probably be assign as the cause of this refinement no one deny this invention to be modern but some of the more zealous partizans of the ancients have assert it to be foppish and ridiculous and a reproach rather than a credit to the present age it may here be proper to examine this question nature have implant in all live creatures an affection between the sex which even in the fiercest and most rapacious animals be not merely confine to the satisfaction of the bodily appetite but beget a friendship and mutual sympathy which run through the whole tenor of their live nay even in those species where nature limit the indulgence of this appetite to one season and to one object and form a kind of marriage or association between a single male and female there be yet a visible complacency and benevolence which extend farther and mutually soften the affections of the sex towards each otherl how much more must this have place in man where the confinement of the appetite be not natural but either be derive accidentally from some strong charm of love or arise from reflections on duty and convenience nothing therefore can proceed less from affectation than the passion of gallantry it be natural in the highest degree art and education in the most elegant court make no more alteration on it than on all the other laudable passions they only turn the mind more towards it they refine it they polish it and give it a proper grace and expression but gallantry be as generous as it be natural to correct such gross vices as lead us to commit real injury on others be the part of morals and the object of the most ordinary education where that be not attend to in some degree no human society can subsist but in order to render conversation and the intercourse of mind more easy and agreeable goodmanners have be invent and have carry the matter somewhat farther wherever nature have give the mind a propensity to any vice or to any passion disagreeable to others refine breed have teach men to throw the bias on the opposite side and to preserve in all their behaviour the appearance of sentiments different from those to which they naturally incline thus as we be commonly proud and selfish and apt to assume the preference above others a polite man learn to behave with deference towards his companion and to yield the superiority to them in all the common incidents of society in like manner wherever a persons situation may naturally beget any disagreeable suspicion in him it be the part of goodmanners to prevent it by a study display of sentiments directly contrary to those of which he be apt to be jealous thus old men know their infirmities and naturally dread contempt from the youth hence welleducated youth redouble the instance of respect and deference to their elders strangers and foreigners be without protection hence in all polite countries they receive the highest civilities and be entitle to the first place in every company a man be lord in his own family and his guests be in a manner subject to his authority hence he be always the lowest person in the company attentive to the want of every one and give himself all the trouble in order to please which may not betray too visible an affectation or impose too much constraint on his guests gallantry be nothing but an instance of the same generous attention as nature have give man the superiority above woman by endow him with greater strength both of mind and body it be his part to alleviate that superiority as much as possible by the generosity of his behaviour and by a study deference and complaisance for all her inclinations and opinions barbarous nations display this superiority by reduce their females to the most abject slavery by confine them by beat them by sell them by kill them but the male sex among a polite people discover their authority in a more generous though not a less evident manner by civility by respect by complaisance and in a word by gallantry in good company you need not ask who be the master of the feast the man who sit in the lowest place and who be always industrious in help every one be certainly the person we must either condemn all such instance of generosity as foppish and affect or admit of gallantry among the rest the ancient muscovites wed their wive with a whip instead of a ring the same people in their own house take always the precedency above foreigners even foreign ambassadors these two instance of their generosity and politeness be much of a piece gallantry be not less compatible with wisdom and prudence than with nature and generosity and when under proper regulations contribute more than any other invention to the entertainment and improvement of the youth of both sexesm among every species of animals nature have found on the love between the sex their sweetest and best enjoyment but the satisfaction of the bodily appetite be not alone sufficient to gratify the mind and even among brutecreatures we find that their play and dalliance and other expressions of fondness form the greatest part of the entertainment in rational be we must certainly admit the mind for a considerable share be we to rob the feast of all its garniture of reason discourse sympathy friendship and gaiety what remain would scarcely be worth acceptance in the judgment of the truly elegant and luxurious what better school for manners than the company of virtuous women where the mutual endeavour to please must insensibly polish the mind where the example of the female softness and modesty must communicate itself to their admirers and where the delicacy of that sex put every one on his guard lest he give offence by any breach of decencyn among the ancients the character of the fairsex be consider as altogether domestic nor be they regard as part of the polite world or of good company this perhaps be the true reason why the ancients have not leave us one piece of pleasantry that be excellent unless one may except the banquet of xenophon and the dialogues of lucian though many of their serious compositions be altogether inimitable horace condemn the coarse railleries and cold jest of plautus but though the most easy agreeable and judicious writer in the world be his own talent for ridicule very strike or refine this therefore be one considerable improvement which the polite arts have receive from gallantry and from court where it first aroseo but to return from this digression shall advance it as a fourth observation on this subject of the rise and progress of the arts and sciences that when the arts and sciences come to perfection in any state from that moment they naturally or rather necessarily decline and seldom or never revive in that nation where they formerly flourish it must be confess that this maxim though conformable to experience may at first sight be esteem contrary to reason if the natural genius of mankind be the same in all age and in almost all countries as seem to be the truth it must very much forward and cultivate this genius to be possess of pattern in every art which may regulate the taste and fix the object of imitation the model leave us by the ancients give birth to all the arts about years ago and have mightily advance their progress in every country of europe why have they not a like effect during the reign of trajan and his successors when they be much more entire and be still admire and study by the whole world so late as the emperor justinian the poet by way of distinction be understand among the greeks to be homer among the romans virgil such admiration still remain for these divine geniuses though no poet have appear for many centuries who could justly pretend to have imitate them a man genius be always in the begin of life as much unknown to himself as to others and it be only after frequent trials attend with success that he dare think himself equal to those undertake in which those who have succeed have fix the admiration of mankind if his own nation be already possess of many model of eloquence he naturally compare his own juvenile exercise with these and be sensible of the great disproportion be discourage from any farther attempt and never aim at a rivalship with those author whom he so much admire a noble emulation be the source of every excellence admiration and modesty naturally extinguish this emulation and no one be so liable to an excess of admiration and modesty as a truly great genius next to emulation the greatest encourager of the noble arts be praise and glory a writer be animate with new force when he hear the applauses of the world for his former productions and be rouse by such a motive he often reach a pitch of perfection which be equally surprizing to himself and to his readers but when the post of honour be all occupy his first attempt be but coldly receive by the public be compare to productions which be both in themselves more excellent and have already the advantage of an establish reputation be moliere and corneille to bring upon the stage at present their early productions which be formerly so well receive it would discourage the young poets to see the indifference and disdain of the public the ignorance of the age alone could have give admission to the prince oftyre but it be to that we owe the moor have every man in his humour be reject we have never see volpone perhaps it may not be for the advantage of any nation to have the arts import from their neighbour in too great perfection this extinguish emulation and sink the ardour of the generous youth so many model of italian paint bring into england instead of excite our artists be the cause of their small progress in that noble art the same perhaps be the case of rome when it receive the arts from greece that multitude of polite productions in the french language disperse all over germany and the north hinder these nations from cultivate their own language and keep them still dependent on their neighbour for those elegant entertainments it be true the ancients have leave us model in every kind of write which be highly worthy of admiration but besides that they be write in languages know only to the learn besides this say the comparison be not so perfect or entire between modern wits and those who live in so remote an age have waller be bear in rome during the reign of tiberius his first productions have be despise when compare to the finish odes of horace but in this island the superiority of the roman poet diminish nothing from the fame of the english we esteem ourselves sufficiently happy that our climate and language could produce but a faint copy of so excellent an original in short the arts and sciences like some plant require a fresh soil and however rich the land may be and however you may recruit it by art or care it will never when once exhaust produce any thing that be perfect or finish in the kind essay the epicurean it be a great mortification to the vanity of man that his utmost art and industry can never equal the meanest of natures productions either for beauty or value art be only the underworkman and be employ to give a few stroke of embellishment to those piece which come from the hand of the master some of the drapery may be of his draw but he be not allow to touch the principal figure art may make a suit of clothe but nature must produce a man even in those productions commonly denominate work of art we find that the noblest of the kind be behold for their chief beauty to the force and happy influence of nature to thea native enthusiasm of the poets we owe whatever be admirable in their productions the greatest genius where nature at any time fail him for she be not equal throw aside the lyre and hop not from the rule of art to reach that divine harmony which must proceed from her inspiration alone how poor be those songs where a happy flow of fancy have not furnish materials for art to embellish and refine but of all the fruitless attempt of art no one be so ridiculous as that which the severe philosophers have undertake the produce of an artificial happiness and make us be please by rule of reason and by reflection why do none of them claim the reward which xerxes promise to him who should invent a new pleasure unless perhaps they invent so many pleasures for their own use that they despise riches and stand in no need of any enjoyments which the reward of that monarch could procure them be apt indeed to think that they be not will to furnish the persian court with a new pleasure by present it with so new and unusual an object of ridicule their speculations when confine to theory and gravely deliver in the school of greece might excite admiration in their ignorant pupils but the attempt to reduce such principles to practice would soon have betray their absurdity you pretend to make me happy by reason and by rule of art you must then create me anew by rule of art for on my original frame and structure do my happiness depend but you want power to effect this and skill too be afraid nor can entertain a less opinion of natures wisdom than of yours and let her conduct the machine which she have so wisely frame find that should only spoil it by my tamper to what purpose should pretend to regulate refine or invigorate any of those spring or principles which nature have implant in me be this the road by which must reach happiness but happiness imply ease contentment repose and pleasure not watchfulness care and fatigue the health of my body consist in the facility with which all its operations be perform the stomach digest the aliment the heart circulate the blood the brain separate and refine the spirit and all this without my concern myself in the matter when by my will alone can stop the blood as it run with impetuosity along its canal then may hope to change the course of my sentiments and passions in vain should strain my faculties and endeavour to receive pleasure from an object which be not fit by nature to affect my organs with delight may give myself pain by my fruitless endeavour but shall never reach any pleasure away then with all those vain pretences of make ourselves happy within ourselves of feast on our own thoughts of be satisfy with the consciousness of welldoing and of despise all assistance and all supply from external object this be the voice of pride not of nature and it be well if even this pride could support itself and communicate a real inward pleasure however melancholy or severe but this impotent pride can do no more than regulate the outside and with infinite pain and attention compose the language and countenance to a philosophical dignity in order to deceive the ignorant vulgar the heart mean while be empty of all enjoyment and the mind unsupported by its proper object sink into the deepest sorrow and dejection miserable but vain mortal thy mind be happy within itself with what resources be it endow to fill so immense a void and supply the place of all thy bodily sense and faculties can thy head subsist without thy other members in such a situation what foolish figure must it make do nothing else but sleep and ake into such a lethargy or such a melancholy must thy mind be plunge when deprive of foreign occupations and enjoyments keep me therefore no longer in this violent constraint confine me not within myself but point out to me those object and pleasures which afford the chief enjoyment but why do apply to you proud and ignorant sag to shew me the road to happiness let me consult my own passions and inclinations in them must read the dictate of nature not in your frivolous discourse but see propitious to my wish the divine the amiable pleasure the supreme love of gods and men advance towards me at her approach my heart beat with genial heat and every sense and every faculty be dissolve in joy while she pour around me all the embellishments of the spring and all the treasure of the autumn the melody of her voice charm my ears with the softest music as she invite me to partake of those delicious fruit which with a smile that diffuse a glory on the heavens and the earth she present to me the sportive cupids who attend her or fan me with their odoriferous wing or pour on my head the most fragrant oil or offer me their sparkle nectar in golden goblets o for ever let me spread my limbs on this bed of roses and thus thus feel the delicious moments with soft and downy step glide along but cruel chance whither do you fly so fast why do my ardent wish and that load of pleasures under which you labour rather hasten than retard your unrelenting pace suffer me to enjoy this soft repose after all my fatigue in search of happiness suffer me to satiate myself with these delicacies after the pain of so long and so foolish an abstinence but it will not do the roses have lose their hue the fruit its flavour and that delicious wine whose fume so late intoxicate all my sense with such delight now solicit in vain the sate palate pleasure smile at my languor she beckon her sister virtue to come to her assistance the gay the frolic virtue observe the call and bring along the whole troop of my jovial friends welcome thrice welcome my ever dear companion to these shady bower and to this luxurious repast your presence have restore to the rise its hue and to the fruit its flavour the vapours of this sprightly nectar now again play around my heart while you partake of my delight and discover in your chearful look the pleasure which you receive from my happiness and satisfaction the like do receive from yours and encourage by your joyous presence shall again renew the feast with which from too much enjoyment my sense be well nigh sate while the mind keep not pace with the body nor afford relief to her oerburthened partner in our chearful discourse better than in the formal reason of the school be true wisdom to be find in our friendly endearments better than in the hollow debate of statesmen and pretend patriots do true virtue display itself forgetful of the past secure of the future let us here enjoy the present and while we yet possess a be let us fix some good beyond the power of fate or fortune tomorrow will bring its own pleasures along with it or should it disappoint our fond wish we shall at least enjoy the pleasure of reflect on the pleasures of today fear not my friends that the barbarous dissonance of bacchus and of his revellers should break in upon this entertainment and confound us with their turbulent and clamorous pleasures the sprightly muse wait around and with their charm symphony sufficient to soften the wolves and tygers of the savage desert inspire a soft joy into every bosom peace harmony and concord reign in this retreat nor be the silence ever break but by the music of our songs or the chearful accent of our friendly voice but hark the favourite of the muse the gentle damon strike the lyre and while he accompany its harmonious note with his more harmonious song he inspire us with the same happy debauch of fancy by which he be himself transport ye happy youth he sing ye favour of heaven while the wanton spring pour upon you all her bloom honour let not glory seduce you with her delusive blaze to pass in peril and dangers this delicious season this prime of life wisdom point out to you the road to pleasure nature too beckon you to follow her in that smooth and flowery path will you shut your ears to their command voice will you harden your heart to their soft allurements oh delude mortals thus to lose your youth thus to throw away so invaluable a present to trifle with so perish a bless contemplate well your recompence consider that glory which so allure your proud hearts and seduce you with your own praise it be an echo a dream nay the shadow of a dream dissipate by every wind and lose by every contrary breath of the ignorant and illjudging multitude you fear not that even death itself shall ravish it from you but behold while you be yet alive calumny bereave you of it ignorance neglect it nature enjoy it not fancy alone renounce every pleasure receive this airy recompence empty and unstable as herself thus the hours pass unperceived along and lead in their wanton train all the pleasures of sense and all the joy of harmony and friendship smile innocence close the procession and while she present herself to our ravish eye she embellish the whole scene and render the view of these pleasures as transport after they have past us as when with laugh countenance they be yet advance towards us but the sun have sink below the horizon and darkness steal silently upon us have now bury all nature in an universal shade rejoice my friends continue your repast or change it for soft repose though absent your joy or your tranquillity shall still be mine but whither do you go or what new pleasures call you from our society be there aught agreeable without your friends and can aught please in which we partake not yes my friends the joy which now seek admit not of your participation here alone wish your absence and here alone can find a sufficient compensation for the loss of your society but have not advance far through the shade of the thick wood which spread a double night around me ere methinks perceive through the gloom the charm cælia the mistress of my wish who wander impatient through the grove and prevent the appoint hour silently chide my tardy step but the joy which she receive from my presence best plead my excuse and dissipate every anxious and every angry think leave room for nought but mutual joy and rapture with what word my fair one shall express my tenderness or describe the emotions which now warm my transport bosom word be too faint to describe my love and if alas you feel not the same flame within you in vain shall endeavour to convey to you a just conception of it but your every word and every motion suffice to remove this doubt and while they express your passion serve also to enflame mine how amiable this solitude this silence this darkness no object now importune the ravish soul the think the sense all full of nothing but our mutual happiness wholly possess the mind and convey a pleasure which delude mortals vainly seek for in every other enjoyment but whyb do your bosom heave with these sigh while tear bathe your glow cheek why distract your heart with such vain anxieties why so often ask me how long my love shall yet endure alas my cælia can resolve this question do know how long my life shall yet endure but do this also disturb your tender breast and be the image of our frail mortality for ever present with you to throw a damp on your gayest hours and poison even those joy which love inspire consider rather that if life be frail if youth be transitory we should well employ the present moment and lose no part of so perishable an existence yet a little moment and these shall be no more we shall be as if we have never be not a memory of us be leave upon earth and even the fabulous shade below will not afford us a habitation our fruitless anxieties our vain project our uncertain speculations shall all be swallow up and lose our present doubt concern the original cause of all things must never alas be resolve this alone we may be certain of that if any govern mind preside he must be please to see us fulfil the end of our be and enjoy that pleasure for which alone we be create let this reflection give ease to your anxious thoughts but render not your joy too serious by dwell for ever upon it it be sufficient once to be acquaint with this philosophy in order to give an unbounded loose to love and jollity and remove all the scruple of a vain superstition but while youth and passion my fair one prompt our eager desire we must find gayer subject of discourse to intermix with these amorous caress essay the stoic there be this obvious and material difference in the conduct of nature with regard to man and other animals that have endow the former with a sublime celestial spirit and have give him an affinity with superior be she allow not such noble faculties to lie lethargic or idle but urge him by necessity to employ on every emergence his utmost art and industry brutecreatures have many of their necessities supply by nature be cloathed and arm by this beneficent parent of all things and where their own industry be requisite on any occasion nature by implant instincts still supply them with the art and guide them to their good by her unerring precepts but man expose naked and indigent to the rude elements rise slowly from that helpless state by the care and vigilance of his parent and have attain his utmost growth and perfection reach only a capacity of subsist by his own care and vigilance every thing be sell to skill and labour and where nature furnish the materials they be still rude and unfinished till industry ever active and intelligent refine them from their brute state and fit them for human use and convenience acknowledge therefore o man the beneficence of nature for she have give thee that intelligence which supply all thy necessities but let not indolence under the false appearance of gratitude persuade thee to rest content with her present wouldest thou return to the raw herbage for thy food to the open sky for thy cover and to stone and club for thy defence against the ravenous animals of the desert then return also to thy savage manners to thy timorous superstition to thy brutal ignorance and sink thyself below those animals whose condition thou admirest and wouldest so fondly imitate thy kind parent nature have give thee art and intelligence have fill the whole globe with materials to employ these talents hearken to her voice which so plainly tell thee that thou thyself shouldest also be the object of thy industry and that by art and attention alone thou canst acquire that ability which will raise thee to thy proper station in the universe behold this artizan who convert a rude and shapeless stone into a noble metal and mold that metal by his cunning hand create as it be by magic every weapon for his defence and every utensil for his convenience he have not this skill from nature use and practice have teach it him and if thou wouldest emulate his success thou must follow his laborious footsteps but while thou ambitiously aspirest to perfect thy bodily power and faculties wouldest thou meanly neglect thy mind and from a preposterous sloth leave it still rude and uncultivated as it come from the hand of nature far be such folly and negligence from every rational be if nature have be frugal in her gift and endowments there be the more need of art to supply her defect if she have be generous and liberal know that she still expect industry and application on our part and revenge herself in proportion to our negligent ingratitude the richest genius like the most fertile soil when uncultivated shoot up into the rankest weed and instead of vines and olives for the pleasure and use of man produce to its slothful owner the most abundant crop of poison the great end of all human industry be the attainment of happiness for this be arts invent sciences cultivate laws ordain and societies model by the most profound wisdom of patriots and legislators even the lonely savage who lie expose to the inclemency of the elements and the fury of wild beasts forget not for a moment this grand object of his be ignorant as he be of every art of life he still keep in view the end of all those arts and eagerly seek for felicity amidst that darkness with which he be environ but as much as the wildest savage be inferior to the polish citizen who under the protection of laws enjoy every convenience which industry have invent so much be this citizen himself inferior to the man of virtue and the true philosopher who govern his appetites subdue his passions and have learn from reason to set a just value on every pursuit and enjoyment for be there an art and apprenticeship necessary for every other attainment and be there no art of life no rule no precepts to direct us in this principal concern can no particular pleasure be attain without skill and can the whole be regulate without reflection or intelligence by the blind guidance of appetite and instinct surely then no mistake be ever commit in this affair but every man however dissolute and negligent proceed in the pursuit of happiness with as unerring a motion as that which the celestial body observe when conduct by the hand of the almighty they roll along the ethereal plain but if mistake be often be inevitably commit let us register these mistake let us consider their cause let us weigh their importance let us enquire for their remedy when from this we have fix all the rule of conduct we be philosophers when we have reduce these rule to practice we be sag like many subordinate artists employ to form the several wheel and spring of a machine such be those who excel in all the particular arts of life he be the master workman who put those several part together move them accord to just harmony and proportion and produce true felicity as the result of their conspire order while thou hast such an allure object in view shall that labour and attention requisite to the attainment of thy end ever seem burdensome and intolerable know that this labour itself be the chief ingredient of the felicity to which thou aspirest and that every enjoyment soon become insipid and distasteful when not acquire by fatigue and industry see the hardy hunters rise from their downy couch shake off the slumber which still weigh down their heavy eyelids and ere aurora have yet cover the heavens with her flame mantle hasten to the forest they leave behind in their own house and in the neighbour plain animals of every kind whose flesh furnish the most delicious fare and which offer themselves to the fatal stroke laborious man disdain so easy a purchase he seek for a prey which hide itself from his search or fly from his pursuit or defend itself from his violence have exert in the chace every passion of the mind and every member of the body he then find the charm of repose and with joy compare its pleasures to those of his engage labour and can vigorous industry give pleasure to the pursuit even of the most worthless prey which frequently escape our toil and can not the same industry render the cultivate of our mind the moderate of our passions the enlighten of our reason an agreeable occupation while we be every day sensible of our progress and behold our inward feature and countenance brighten incessantly with new charm begin by cure yourself of this lethargic indolence the task be not difficult you need but taste the sweets of honest labour proceed to learn the just value of every pursuit long study be not requisite compare though but for once the mind to the body virtue to fortune and glory to pleasure you will then perceive the advantage of industry you will then be sensible what be the proper object of your industry in vain do you seek repose from bed of roses in vain do you hope for enjoyment from the most delicious win and fruit your indolence itself become a fatigue your pleasure itself create disgust the mind unexercised find every delight insipid and loathsome and ere yet the body full of noxious humour feel the torment of its multiply diseases your nobler part be sensible of the invade poison and seek in vain to relieve its anxiety by new pleasures which still augment the fatal malady need not tell you that by this eager pursuit of pleasure you more and more expose yourself to fortune and accidents and rivet your affections on external object which chance may in a moment ravish from you shall suppose that your indulgent star favour you still with the enjoyment of your riches and possessions prove to you that even in the midst of your luxurious pleasures you be unhappy and that by too much indulgence you be incapable of enjoy what prosperous fortune still allow you to possess but surely the instability of fortune be a consideration not to be overlook or neglect happiness can not possibly exist where there be no security and security can have no place where fortune have any dominion though that unstable deity should not exert her rage against you the dread of it would still torment you would disturb your slumber haunt your dream and throw a damp on the jollity of your most delicious banquet the temple of wisdom be seat on a rock above the rage of the fight elements and inaccessible to all the malice of man the roll thunder break below and those more terrible instrument of human fury reach not to so sublime a height the sage while he breathe that serene air look down with pleasure mix with compassion on the errors of mistake mortals who blindly seek for the true path of life and pursue riches nobility honour or power for genuine felicity the greater part he behold disappoint of their fond wish some lament that have once possess the object of their desire it be ravish from them by envious fortune and all complain that even their own vow though grant can not give them happiness or relieve the anxiety of their distract mind but do the sage always preserve himself in this philosophical indifference and rest content with lament the miseries of mankind without ever employ himself for their relief do he constantly indulge this severe wisdom which by pretend to elevate him above human accidents do in reality harden his heart and render him careless of the interest of mankind and of society no he know that in this sullen apathy neither true wisdom nor true happiness can be find he feel too strongly the charm of the social affections ever to counteract so sweet so natural so virtuous a propensity even when bath in tear he lament the miseries of human race of his country of his friends and unable to give succour can only relieve them by compassion he yet rejoice in the generous disposition and feel a satisfaction superior to that of the most indulge sense so engage be the sentiments of humanity that they brighten up the very face of sorrow and operate like the sun which shin on a dusky cloud or fall rain paint on them the most glorious colour which be to be find in the whole circle of nature but it be not here alone that the social virtues display their energy with whatever ingredient you mix them they be still predominant as sorrow can not overcome them so neither can sensual pleasure obscure them the joy of love however tumultuous banish not the tender sentiments of sympathy and affection they even derive their chief influence from that generous passion and when present alone afford nothing to the unhappy mind but lassitude and disgust behold this sprightly debauchee who profess a contempt of all other pleasures but those of wine and jollity separate him from his companion like a spark from a fire where before it contribute to the general blaze his alacrity suddenly extinguish and though surround with every other mean of delight he lothes the sumptuous banquet and prefer even the most abstract study and speculation as more agreeable and entertain but the social passions never afford such transport pleasures or make so glorious an appearance in the eye both of god and man as when shake off every earthly mixture they associate themselves with the sentiments of virtue and prompt us to laudable and worthy action as harmonious colour mutually give and receive a lustre by their friendly union so do these ennoble sentiments of the human mind see the triumph of nature in parental affection what selfish passion what sensual delight be a match for it whether a man exult in the prosperity and virtue of his offspring or fly to their succour through the most threaten and tremendous dangers proceed still in purify the generous passion you will still the more admire its shin glory what charm be there in the harmony of mind and in a friendship found on mutual esteem and gratitude what satisfaction in relieve the distress in comfort the afflict in raise the fall and in stop the career of cruel fortune or of more cruel man in their insult over the good and virtuous but what supreme joy in the victories over vice as well as misery when by virtuous example or wise exhortation our fellowcreatures be teach to govern their passions reform their vices and subdue their worst enemies which inhabit within their own bosom but these object be still too limit for the human mind which be of celestial origin swell with the divinest and most enlarge affections and carry its attention beyond kindred and acquaintance extend its benevolent wish to the most distant posterity it view liberty and laws as the source of human happiness and devote itself with the utmost alacrity to their guardianship and protection toil dangers death itself carry their charm when we brave them for the public good and ennoble that be which we generously sacrifice for the interest of our country happy the man whom indulgent fortune allow to pay to virtue what he owe to nature and to make a generous gift of what must otherwise be ravish from him by cruel necessity in the true sage and patriot be unite whatever can distinguish human nature or elevate mortal man to a resemblance with the divinity the softest benevolence the most undaunted resolution the tenderest sentiments the most sublime love of virtue all these animate successively his transport bosom what satisfaction when he look within to find the most turbulent passions tune to just harmony and concord and every jar sound banish from this enchant music if the contemplation even of inanimate beauty be so delightful if it ravish the sense even when the fair form be foreign to us what must be the effect of moral beauty and what influence must it have when it embellish our own mind and be the result of our own reflection and industry but where be the reward of virtue and what recompence have nature provide for such important sacrifice as those of life and fortune which we must often make to it oh sons of earth be ye ignorant of the value of this celestial mistress and do ye meanly enquire for her portion when ye observe her genuine charm but know that nature have be indulgent to human weakness and have not leave this favourite child naked and unendowed she have provide virtue with the richest dowry but be careful lest the allurements of interest should engage such suitors as be insensible of the native worth of so divine a beauty she have wisely provide that this dowry can have no charm but in the eye of those who be already transport with the love of virtue glory be the portion of virtue the sweet reward of honourable toil the triumphant crown which cover the thoughtful head of the disinterested patriot or the dusty brow of the victorious warrior elevate by so sublime a prize the man of virtue look down with contempt on all the allurements of pleasure and all the menace of danger death itself lose its terrors when he consider that its dominion extend only over a part of him and that in spite of death and time the rage of the elements and the endless vicissitude of human affairs he be assure of an immortal fame among all the sons of men there surely be a be who preside over the universe and who with infinite wisdom and power have reduce the jar elements into just order and proportion let speculative reasoners dispute how far this beneficent be extend his care and whether he prolong our existence beyond the grave in order to bestow on virtue its just reward and render it fully triumphant the man of morals without decide any thing on so dubious a subject be satisfy with the portion mark out to him by the supreme disposer of all things gratefully he accept of that farther reward prepare for him but if disappoint he think not virtue an empty name but justly esteem it its own reward he gratefully acknowledge the bounty of his creator who by call him into existence have thereby afford him an opportunity of once acquire so invaluable a possession essay the platonist to some philosophers it appear matter of surprize that all mankind possess the same nature and be endow with the same faculties should yet differ so widely in their pursuits and inclinations and that one should utterly condemn what be fondly seek after by another to some it appear matter of still more surprize that a man should differ so widely from himself at different time and after possession reject with disdain what before be the object of all his vow and wish to me this feverish uncertainty and irresolution in human conduct seem altogether unavoidable nor can a rational soul make for the contemplation of the supreme be and of his work ever enjoy tranquillity or satisfaction while detain in the ignoble pursuits of sensual pleasure or popular applause the divinity be a boundless ocean of bliss and glory human mind be smaller stream which arise at first from this ocean seek still amid all their wander to return to it and to lose themselves in that immensity of perfection when check in this natural course by vice or folly they become furious and enrage and swell to a torrent do then spread horror and devastation on the neighbour plain in vain by pompous phrase and passionate expression each recommend his own pursuit and invite the credulous hearers to an imitation of his life and manners the heart belie the countenance and sensibly feel even amid the highest success the unsatisfactory nature of all those pleasures which detain it from its true object examine the voluptuous man before enjoyment measure the vehemence of his desire and the importance of his object find that all his happiness proceed only from that hurry of think which take him from himself and turn his view from his guilt and misery consider him a moment after he have now enjoy the pleasure which he fondly seek after the sense of his guilt and misery return upon him with double anguish his mind torment with fear and remorse his body depress with disgust and satiety but a more august at least a more haughty personage present himself boldly to our censure and assume the title of a philosopher and man of morals offer to submit to the most rigid examination he challenge with a visible though conceal impatience our approbation and applause and seem offend that we should hesitate a moment before we break out into admiration of his virtue see this impatience hesitate still more begin to examine the motives of his seem virtue but behold ere can enter upon this enquiry he fling himself from me and address his discourse to that crowd of heedless auditors fondly abuse them by his magnificent pretensions o philosopher thy wisdom be vain and thy virtue unprofitable thou seekest the ignorant applauses of men not the solid reflections of thy own conscience or the more solid approbation of that be who with one regard of his allseeing eye penetrate the universe thou surely art conscious of the hollowness of thy pretend probity whilst call thyself a citizen a son a friend thou forgettest thy higher sovereign thy true father thy greatest benefactor where be the adoration due to infinite perfection whence every thing good and valuable be derive where be the gratitude owe to thy creator who call thee forth from nothing who place thee in all these relations to thy fellowcreatures and require thee to fulfil the duty of each relation forbid thee to neglect what thou owest to himself the most perfect be to whom thou art connect by the closest tye but thou art thyself thy own idol thou worshippest thy imaginary perfections or rather sensible of thy real imperfections thou seekest only to deceive the world and to please thy fancy by multiply thy ignorant admirers thus not content with neglect what be most excellent in the universe thou desirest to substitute in his place what be most vile and contemptible consider all the work of mens hand all the inventions of human wit in which thou affectest so nice a discernment thou wilt find that the most perfect production still proceed from the most perfect think and that it be mind alone which we admire while we bestow our applause on the grace of a wellproportioned statue or the symmetry of a noble pile the statuary the architect come still in view and make us reflect on the beauty of his art and contrivance which from a heap of unformed matter could extract such expressions and proportion this superior beauty of think and intelligence thou thyself acknowledgest while thou invitest us to contemplate in thy conduct the harmony of affections the dignity of sentiments and all those grace of a mind which chiefly merit our attention but why stoppest thou short seest thou nothing farther that be valuable amid thy rapturous applauses of beauty and order art thou still ignorant where be to be find the most consummate beauty the most perfect order compare the work of art with those of nature the one be but imitations of the other the nearer art approach to nature the more perfect be it esteem but still how wide be its nearest approach and what an immense interval may be observe between them art copy only the outside of nature leave the inward and more admirable spring and principles as exceed her imitation as beyond her comprehension art copy only the minute productions of nature despair to reach that grandeur and magnificence which be so astonish in the masterly work of her original can we then be so blind as not to discover an intelligence and a design in the exquisite and most stupendous contrivance of the universe can we be so stupid as not to feel the warmest raptures of worship and adoration upon the contemplation of that intelligent be so infinitely good and wise the most perfect happiness surely must arise from the contemplation of the most perfect object but what more perfect than beauty and virtue and where be beauty to be find equal to that of the universe or virtue which can be compare to the benevolence and justice of the deity if aught can diminish the pleasure of this contemplation it must be either the narrowness of our faculties which conceal from us the greatest part of these beauties and perfections or the shortness of our live which allow not time sufficient to instruct us in them but it be our comfort that if we employ worthily the faculties here assign us they will be enlarge in another state of existence so as to render us more suitable worshippers of our maker and that the task which can never be finish in time will be the business of an eternity essay the sceptic have long entertain a suspicion with regard to the decisions of philosophers upon all subject and find in myself a greater inclination to dispute than assent to their conclusions there be one mistake to which they seem liable almost without exception they confine too much their principles and make no account of that vast variety which nature have so much affect in all her operations when a philosopher have once lay hold of a favourite principle which perhaps account for many natural effect he extend the same principle over the whole creation and reduce to it every phænomenon though by the most violent and absurd reason our own mind be narrow and contract we can not extend our conception to the variety and extent of nature but imagine that she be as much bound in her operations as we be in our speculation but if ever this infirmity of philosophers be to be suspect on any occasion it be in their reason concern human life and the methods of attain happiness in that case they be lead astray not only by the narrowness of their understand but by that also of their passions almost every one have a predominant inclination to which his other desire and affections submit and which govern him though perhaps with some intervals through the whole course of his life it be difficult for him to apprehend that any thing which appear totally indifferent to him can ever give enjoyment to any person or can possess charm which altogether escape his observation his own pursuits be always in his account the most engage the object of his passion the most valuable and the road which he pursue the only one that lead to happiness but would these prejudice reasoners reflect a moment there be many obvious instance and arguments sufficient to undeceive them and make them enlarge their maxims and principles do they not see the vast variety of inclinations and pursuits among our species where each man seem fully satisfy with his own course of life and would esteem it the greatest unhappiness to be confine to that of his neighbour do they not feel in themselves that what please at one time displease at another by the change of inclination and that it be not in their power by their utmost efforts to recall that taste or appetite which formerly bestow charm on what now appear indifferent or disagreeable what be the mean therefore of those general preferences of the town or country life of a life of action or one of pleasure of retirement or society when besides the different inclinations of different men every ones experience may convince him that each of these kinds of life be agreeable in its turn and that their variety or their judicious mixture chiefly contribute to the render all of them agreeable but shall this business be allow to go altogether at adventure and must a man consult only his humour and inclination in order to determine his course of life without employ his reason to inform him what road be preferable and lead most surely to happiness be there no difference then between one man conduct and another answer there be a great difference one man follow his inclination in chusing his course of life may employ much surer mean for succeed than another who be lead by his inclination into the same course of life and pursue the same object be riches the chief object of your desire acquire skill in your profession be diligent in the exercise of it enlarge the circle of your friends and acquaintance avoid pleasure and expence and never be generous but with a view of gain more than you could save by frugality would you acquire the public esteem guard equally against the extremes of arrogance and fawn let it appear that you set a value upon yourself but without despise others if you fall into either of the extremes you either provoke mens pride by your insolence or teach them to despise you by your timorous submission and by the mean opinion which you seem to entertain of yourself these you say be the maxims of common prudence and discretion what every parent inculcate on his child and what every man of sense pursue in the course of life which he have chosenwhat be it then you desire more do you come to a philosopher as to a cunning man to learn something by magic or witchcraft beyond what can be know by common prudence and discretionyes we come to a philosopher to be instruct how we shall chuse our end more than the mean for attain these end we want to know what desire we shall gratify what passion we shall comply with what appetite we shall indulge as to the rest we trust to common sense and the general maxims of the world for our instruction be sorry then have pretend to be a philosopher for find your question very perplex and be in danger if my answer be too rigid and severe of pass for a pedant and scholastic if it be too easy and free of be take for a preacher of vice and immorality however to satisfy you shall deliver my opinion upon the matter and shall only desire you to esteem it of as little consequence as do myself by that mean you will neither think it worthy of your ridicule nor your anger if we can depend upon any principle which we learn from philosophy this think may be consider as certain and undoubted that there be nothing in itself valuable or despicable desirable or hateful beautiful or deform but that these attribute arise from the particular constitution and fabric of human sentiment and affection what seem the most delicious food to one animal appear loathsome to another what affect the feel of one with delight produce uneasiness in another this be confessedly the case with regard to all the bodily sense but if we examine the matter more accurately we shall find that the same observation hold even where the mind concur with the body and mingle its sentiment with the exterior appetite desire this passionate lover to give you a character of his mistress he will tell you that he be at a loss for word to describe her charm and will ask you very seriously if ever you be acquaint with a goddess or an angel if you answer that you never be he will then say that it be impossible for you to form a conception of such divine beauties as those which his charmer possess so complete a shape such wellonline library of liberty essay moral political literary lf ed proportion feature so engage an air such sweetness of disposition such gaiety of humour you can infer nothing however from all this discourse but that the poor man be in love and that the general appetite between the sex which nature have infuse into all animals be in him determine to a particular object by some qualities which give him pleasure the same divine creature not only to a different animal but also to a different man appear a mere mortal be and be behold with the utmost indifference nature have give all animals a like prejudice in favour of their offspring as soon as the helpless infant see the light though in every other eye it appear a despicable and a miserable creature it be regard by its fond parent with the utmost affection and be prefer to every other object however perfect and accomplish the passion alone arise from the original structure and formation of human nature bestow a value on the most insignificant object we may push the same observation further and may conclude that even when the mind operate alone and feel the sentiment of blame or approbation pronounce one object deform and odious another beautiful and amiable say that even in this case those qualities be not really in the object but belong entirely to the sentiment of that mind which blame or praise grant that it will be more difficult to make this proposition evident and as it be palpable to negligent thinkers because nature be more uniform in the sentiments of the mind than in most feel of the body and produce a nearer resemblance in the inward than in the outward part of human kind there be something approach to principles in mental taste and critics can reason and dispute more plausibly than cook or perfumers we may observe however that this uniformity among human kind hinder not but that there be a considerable diversity in the sentiments of beauty and worth and that education custom prejudice caprice and humour frequently vary our taste of this kind you will never convince a man who be not accustom to italian music and have not an ear to follow its intricacies that a scotch tune be not preferable you have not even any single argument beyond your own taste which you can employ in your behalf and to your antagonist his particular taste will always appear a more convince argument to the contrary if you be wise each of you will allow that the other may be in the right and have many other instance of this diversity of taste you will both confess that beauty and worth be merely of a relative nature and consist in an agreeable sentiment produce by an object in a particular mind accord to the peculiar structure and constitution of that mind by this diversity of sentiment observable in human kind nature have perhaps intend to make us sensible of her authority and let us see what surprizing change she could produce on the passions and desire of mankind merely by the change of their inward fabric without any alteration on the object the vulgar may even be convince by this argument but men accustom to think may draw a more convince at least a more general argument from the very nature of the subject in the operation of reason the mind do nothing but run over its object as they be suppose to stand in reality without add any thing to them or diminish any thing from them if examine the ptolomaic and copernican systems endeavour only by my enquiries to know the real situation of the planets that be in other word endeavour to give them in my conception the same relations that they bear towards each other in the heavens to this operation of the mind therefore there seem to be always a real though often an unknown standard in the nature of things nor be truth or falsehood variable by the various apprehensions of mankind though all human race should for ever conclude that the sun move and the earth remain at rest the sun stir not an inch from his place for all these reason and such conclusions be eternally false and erroneous but the case be not the same with the qualities of beautiful and deform desirable and odious as with truth and falsehood in the former case the mind be not content with merely survey its object as they stand in themselves it also feel a sentiment of delight or uneasiness approbation or blame consequent to that survey and this sentiment determine it to affix the epithet beautiful or deform desirable or odious now it be evident that this sentiment must depend upon the particular fabric or structure of the mind which enable such particular form to operate in such a particular manner and produce a sympathy or conformity between the mind and its object vary the structure of the mind or inward organs the sentiment no longer follow though the form remain the same the sentiment be different from the object and arise from its operation upon the organs of the mind an alteration upon the latter must vary the effect nor can the same object present to a mind totally different produce the same sentiment this conclusion every one be apt to draw of himself without much philosophy where the sentiment be evidently distinguishable from the object who be not sensible that power and glory and vengeance be not desirable of themselves but derive all their value from the structure of human passions which beget a desire towards such particular pursuits but with regard to beauty either natural or moral the case be commonly suppose to be different the agreeable quality be think to lie in the object not in the sentiment and that merely because the sentiment be not so turbulent and violent as to distinguish itself in an evident manner from the perception of the object but a little reflection suffice to distinguish them a man may know exactly all the circle and ellipses of the copernican system and all the irregular spiral of the ptolomaic without perceive that the former be more beautiful than the latter euclid have fully explain every quality of the circle but have not in any proposition say a word of its beauty the reason be evident beauty be not a quality of the circle it lie not in any part of the line whose part be all equally distant from a common center it be only the effect which that figure produce upon a mind whose particular fabric or structure render it susceptible of such sentiments in vain would you look for it in the circle or seek it either by your sense or by mathematical reason in all the properties of that figure the mathematician who take no other pleasure in read virgil but that of examine eneass voyage by the map might perfectly understand the mean of every latin word employ by that divine author and consequently might have a distinct idea of the whole narration he would even have a more distinct idea of it than they could attain who have not study so exactly the geography of the poem he know therefore every thing in the poem but he be ignorant of its beauty because the beauty properly speak lie not in the poem but in the sentiment or taste of the reader and where a man have no such delicacy of temper as to make him feel this sentiment he must be ignorant of the beauty though possess of the science and understand of an angel the inference upon the whole be that it be not from the value or worth of the object which any person pursue that we can determine his enjoyment but merely from the passion with which he pursue it and the success which he meet with in his pursuit object have absolutely no worth or value in themselves they derive their worth merely from the passion if that be strong and steady and successful the person be happy it can not reasonably be doubt but a little miss dress in a new gown for a dancingschool ball receive as compleat enjoyment as the greatest orator who triumph in the spendor of his eloquence while he govern the passions and resolutions of a numerous assembly all the difference therefore between one man and another with regard to life consist either in the passion or in the enjoyment and these differences be sufficient to produce the wide extremes of happiness and misery to be happy the passion must neither be too violent nor too remiss in the first case the mind be in a perpetual hurry and tumult in the second it sink into a disagreeable indolence and lethargy to be happy the passion must be benign and social not rough or fierce the affections of the latter kind be not near so agreeable to the feel as those of the former who will compare rancour and animosity envy and revenge to friendship benignity clemency and gratitude to be happy the passion must be chearful and gay not gloomy and melancholy a propensity to hope and joy be real riches one to fear and sorrow real poverty some passions or inclinations in the enjoyment of their object be not so steady or constant as others nor convey such durable pleasure and satisfaction philosophical devotion for instance like the enthusiasm of a poet be the transitory effect of high spirit great leisure a fine genius and a habit of study and contemplation but notwithstanding all these circumstances an abstract invisible object like that which natural religion alone present to us can not long actuate the mind or be of any moment in life to render the passion of continuance we must find some method of affect the sense and imagination and must embrace some historical as well as philosophical account of the divinity popular superstitions and observances be even find to be of use in this particular though the temper of men be very different yet we may safely pronounce in general that a life of pleasure can not support itself so long as one of business but be much more subject to satiety and disgust the amusements which be the most durable have all a mixture of application and attention in them such as game and hunt and in general business and action fill up all the great vacancies in human life but where the temper be the best dispose for any enjoyment the object be often want and in this respect the passions which pursue external object contribute not so much to happiness as those which rest in ourselves since we be neither so certain of attain such object nor so secure in possess them a passion for learn be preferable with regard to happiness to one for riches some men be possess of great strength of mind and even when they pursue external object be not much affect by a disappointment but renew their application and industry with the greatest chearfulness nothing contribute more to happiness than such a turn of mind accord to this short and imperfect sketch of human life the happiest disposition of mind be the virtuous or in other word that which lead to action and employment render us sensible to the social passions steel the heart against the assault of fortune reduce the affections to a just moderation make our own thoughts an entertainment to us and incline us rather to the pleasures of society and conversation than to those of the sense this in the mean time must be obvious to the most careless reasoner that all dispositions of mind be not alike favourable to happiness and that one passion or humour may be extremely desirable while another be equally disagreeable and indeed all the difference between the condition of life depend upon the mind nor be there any one situation of affairs in itself preferable to another good and ill both natural and moral be entirely relative to human sentiment and affection no man would ever be unhappy could he alter his feel proteuslike he would elude all attack by the continual alterations of his shape and form but of this resource nature have in a great measure deprive us the fabric and constitution of our mind no more depend on our choice than that of our body the generality of men have not even the smallest notion that any alteration in this respect can ever be desirable as a stream necessarily follow the several inclinations of the grind on which it run so be the ignorant and thoughtless part of mankind actuate by their natural propensities such be effectually exclude from all pretensions to philosophy and the medicine of the mind so much boast but even upon the wise and thoughtful nature have a prodigious influence nor be it always in a man power by the utmost art and industry to correct his temper and attain that virtuous character to which he aspire the empire of philosophy extend over a few and with regard to these too her authority be very weak and limit men may well be sensible of the value of virtue and may desire to attain it but it be not always certain that they will be successful in their wish whoever consider without prejudice the course of human action will find that mankind be almost entirely guide by constitution and temper and that general maxims have little influence but so far as they affect our taste or sentiment if a man have a lively sense of honour and virtue with moderate passions his conduct will always be conformable to the rule of morality or if he depart from them his return will be easy and expeditious on the other hand where one be bear of so perverse a frame of mind of so callous and insensible a disposition as to have no relish for virtue and humanity no sympathy with his fellowcreatures no desire of esteem and applause such a one must be allow entirely incurable nor be there any remedy in philosophy he reap no satisfaction but from low and sensual object or from the indulgence of malignant passions he feel no remorse to controul his vicious inclinations he have not even that sense or taste which be requisite to make him desire a better character for my part know not how should address myself to such a one or by what arguments should endeavour to reform him should tell him of the inward satisfaction which result from laudable and humane action the delicate pleasure of disinterested love and friendship the last enjoyments of a good name and an establish character he might still reply that these be perhaps pleasures to such as be susceptible of them but that for his part he find himself of a quite different turn and disposition must repeat it my philosophy afford no remedy in such a case nor could do any thing but lament this persons unhappy condition but then ask if any other philosophy can afford a remedy or if it be possible by any system to render all mankind virtuous however perverse may be their natural frame of mind experience will soon convince us of the contrary and will venture to affirm that perhaps the chief benefit which result from philosophy arise in an indirect mannera and proceed more from its secret insensible influence than from its immediate application it be certain that a serious attention to the sciences and liberal arts soften and humanize the temper and cherish those fine emotions in which true virtue and honour consist it rarely very rarely happen that a man of taste and learn be not at least an honest man whatever frailties may attend him the bend of his mind to speculative study must mortify in him the passions of interest and ambition and must at the same time give him a greater sensibility of all the decencies and duties of life he feel more fully a moral distinction in character and manners nor be his sense of this kind diminish but on the contrary it be much encreased by speculation besides such insensible change upon the temper and disposition it be highly probable that others may be produce by study and application the prodigious effect of education may convince us that the mind be not altogether stubborn and inflexible but will admit of many alterations from its original make and structure let a man propose to himself the model of a character which he approve let him be well acquaint with those particulars in which his own character deviate from this model let him keep a constant watch over himself and bend his mind by a continual effort from the vices towards the virtues and doubt not but in time he will find in his temper an alteration for the better habit be another powerful mean of reform the mind and implant in it good dispositions and inclinations a man who continue in a course of sobriety and temperance will hate riot and disorder if he engage in business or study indolence will seem a punishment to him if he constrain himself to practise beneficence and affability he will soon abhor all instance of pride and violence where one be thoroughly convince that the virtuous course of life be preferable if he have but resolution enough for some time to impose a violence on himself his reformation need not be despair of the misfortune be that this conviction and this resolution never can have place unless a man be beforehand tolerably virtuous here then be the chief triumph of art and philosophy it insensibly refine the temper and it point out to us those dispositions which we should endeavour to attain by a constant bend of mind and by repeat habit beyond this can not acknowledge it to have great influence and must entertain doubt concern all those exhortations and consolations which be in such vogue among speculative reasoners we have already observe that no object be in themselves desirable or odious valuable or despicable but that object acquire these qualities from the particular character and constitution of the mind which survey them to diminish therefore or augment any persons value for an object to excite or moderate his passions there be no direct arguments or reason which can be employ with any force or influence the catch of fly like domitian if it give more pleasure be preferable to the hunt of wild beasts like william rufus or conquer of kingdoms like alexander but though the value of every object can be determine only by the sentiment or passion of every individual we may observe that the passion in pronounce its verdict consider not the object simply as it be in itself but survey it with all the circumstances which attend it a man transport with joy on account of his possess a diamond confine not his view to the glistering stone before him he also consider its rarity and thence chiefly arise his pleasure and exultation here therefore a philosopher may step in and suggest particular view and considerations and circumstances which otherwise would have escape us and by that mean he may either moderate or excite any particular passion it may seem unreasonable absolutely to deny the authority of philosophy in this respect but it must be confess that there lie this strong presumption against it that if these view be natural and obvious they would have occur of themselves without the assistance of philosophy if they be not natural they never can have any influence on the affections these be of a very delicate nature and can not be force or constrain by the utmost art or industry a consideration which we seek for on purpose which we enter into with difficulty which we can not retain without care and attention will never produce those genuine and durable movements of passion which be the result of nature and the constitution of the mind a man may as well pretend to cure himself of love by view his mistress through the artificial medium of a microscope or prospect and behold there the coarsen of her skin and monstrous disproportion of her feature as hope to excite or moderate any passion by the artificial arguments of a seneca or an epictetus the remembrance of the natural aspect and situation of the object will in both case still recur upon him the reflections of philosophy be too subtile and distant to take place in common life or eradicate any affection the air be too fine to breathe in where it be above the wind and cloud of the atmosphere another defect of those refine reflections which philosophy suggest to us be that commonly they can not diminish or extinguish our vicious passions without diminish or extinguish such as be virtuous and render the mind totally indifferent and unactive they be for the most part general and be applicable to all our affections in vain do we hope to direct their influence only to one side if by incessant study and meditation we have render them intimate and present to us they will operate throughout and spread an universal insensibility over the mind when we destroy the nerve we extinguish the sense of pleasure together with that of pain in the human body it will be easy by one glance of the eye to find one or other of these defect in most of those philosophical reflections so much celebrate both in ancient and modern time let not the injuries or violence of men say the philosophersever discompose you by anger or hatred would you be angry at the ape for its malice or the tyger for its ferocity this reflection lead us into a bad opinion of human nature and must extinguish the social affections it tend also to prevent all remorse for a man own crimes when he consider that vice be as natural to mankind as the particular instincts to brutecreatures all ills arise from the order of the universe which be absolutely perfect would you wish to disturb so divine an order for the sake of your own particular interest what if the ills suffer arise from malice or oppression but the vices and imperfections of men be also comprehend in the order of the universe if plague and earthquakes break not heavns design why then aborgiaor acatiline let this be allow and my own vices will also be a part of the same order to one who say that none be happy who be not above opinion a spartan reply then none be happy but knaves and robbers b man be bear to be miserable and be he surprized at any particular misfortune and can he give way to sorrow and lamentation upon account of any disaster yes he very reasonably lament that he should be bear to be miserable your consolation present a hundred ills for one of which you pretend to ease him you should always have before your eye death disease poverty blindness exile calumny and infamy as ills which be incident to human nature if any one of these ills fall to your lot you will bear it the better when you have reckon upon it answer if we confine ourselves to a general and distant reflection on the ills of human life that can have no effect to prepare us for them if by close and intense meditation we render them present and intimate to us that be the true secret for poison all our pleasures and render us perpetually miserable your sorrow be fruitless and will not change the course of destiny very true and for that very reason be sorry ciceros consolation for deafness be somewhat curious how many languages be there say he which you do not understand thepunic spanish gallic ægyptian c with regard to all these you be as if you be deaf yet you be indifferent about the matter be it then so great a misfortune to be deaf to one language more like better the repartee of antipater the cyreniac when some women be condole with him for his blindness what say he do you

globe in comparison of the infinite extent of nature this consideration be evidently too distant ever to have any effect or if it have any would it not destroy patriotism as well as ambition the same gallant author add with some reason that the bright eye of the ladies be the only object which lose nothing of their lustre or value from the most extensive view of astronomy but stand proof against every system would philosophers advise us to limit our affection to them cexile say plutarch to a friend in banishment be no evil mathematicians tell us that the whole earth be but a point compare to the heavens to change ones country then be little more than to remove from one street to another man be not a plant root to a certain spot of earth all soil and all climates be alike suit to him these topics be admirable could they fall only into the hand of banish persons but what if they come also to the knowledge of those who be employ in public affairs and destroy all their attachment to their native country or will they operate like the quack medicine which be equally good for a diabetes and a dropsy it be certain be a superior be thrust into a human body that the whole of life would to him appear so mean contemptible and puerile that he never could be induce to take part in any thing and would scarcely give attention to what pass around him to engage him to such a condescension as to play even the part of a philip with zeal and alacrity would be much more difficult than to constrain the same philip after have be a king and a conqueror during fifty years to mend old shoe with proper care and attention the occupation which lucian assign him in the infernal regions now all the same topics of disdain towards human affairs which could operate on this suppose be occur also to a philosopher but be in some measure disproportioned to human capacity and not be fortify by the experience of any thing better they make not a full impression on him he see but he feel not sufficiently their truth and be always a sublime philosopher when he need not that be as long as nothing disturb him or rouzes his affections while others play he wonder at their keenness and ardour but he no sooner put in his own stake than he be commonly transport with the same passions that he have so much condemn while he remain a simple spectator there be two considerations chiefly to be meet with in book of philosophy from which any important effect be to be expect and that because these considerations be draw from common life and occur upon the most superficial view of human affairs when we reflect on the shortness and uncertainty of life how despicable seem all our pursuits of happiness and even if we would extend our concern beyond our own life how frivolous appear our most enlarge and most generous project when we consider the incessant change and revolutions of human affairs by which laws and learn book and governments be hurry away by time as by a rapid stream and be lose in the immense ocean of matter such a reflection certainly tend to mortify all our passions but do it not thereby counterwork the artifice of nature who have happily deceive us into an opinion that human life be of some importance and may not such a reflection be employ with success by voluptuous reasoners in order to lead us from the paths of action and virtue into the flowery field of indolence and pleasure we be inform by thucydides that during the famous plague of athens when death seem present to every one a dissolute mirth and gaiety prevail among the people who exhort one another to make the most of life as long as it endure the same observation be make by boccace with regard to the plague of florence d a like principle make soldier during war be more addict to riot and expence than any other race of men present pleasure be always of importance and whatever diminish the importance of all other object must bestow on it an additional influence and valuee the second philosophical consideration which may often have an influence on the affections be derive from a comparison of our own condition with the condition of others this comparison we be continually make even in common life but the misfortune be that we be rather apt to compare our situation with that of our superiors than with that of our inferiors a philosopher correct this natural infirmity by turn his view to the other side in order to render himself easy in the situation to which fortune have confine him there be few people who be not susceptible of some consolation from this reflection though to a very goodnatured man the view of human miseries should rather produce sorrow than comfort and add to his lamentations for his own misfortunes a deep compassion for those of others such be the imperfection even of the best of these philosophical topics of consolation shall conclude this subject with observe that though virtue be undoubtedly the best choice when it be attainable yet such be the disorder and confusion of human affairs that no perfect or regular distribution of happiness and misery be ever in this life to be expect not only the goods of fortune and the endowments of the body both of which be important not only these advantage say be unequally divide between the virtuous and vicious but even the mind itself partake in some degree of this disorder and the most worthy character by the very constitution of the passions enjoy not always the highest felicity it be observable that though every bodily pain proceed from some disorder in the part or organ yet the pain be not always proportion to the disorder but be greater or less accord to the greater or less sensibility of the part upon which the noxious humour exert their influence a toothach produce more violent convulsions of pain than a phthisis or a dropsy in like manner with regard to the œconomy of the mind we may observe that all vice be indeed pernicious yet the disturbance or pain be not measure out by nature with exact proportion to the degree of vice nor be the man of highest virtue even abstract from external accidents always the most happy a gloomy and melancholy disposition be certainly to our sentiments a vice or imperfection but as it may be accompany with great sense of honour and great integrity it may be find in very worthy character though it be sufficient alone to imbitter life and render the person affect with it completely miserable on the other hand a selfish villain may possess a spring and alacrity of temper a certain gaiety of heartf which be indeed a good quality but which be reward much beyond its merit and when attend with good fortune will compensate for the uneasiness and remorse arise from all the other vices shall add as an observation to the same purpose that if a man be liable to a vice or imperfection it may often happen that a good quality which he possess along with it will render him more miserable than if he be completely vicious a person of such imbecility of temper as to be easily break by affliction be more unhappy for be endow with a generous and friendly disposition which give him a lively concern for others and expose him the more to fortune and accidents a sense of shame in an imperfect character be certainly a virtue but produce great uneasiness and remorse from which the abandon villain be entirely free a very amorous complexion with a heart incapable of friendship be happier than the same excess in love with a generosity of temper which transport a man beyond himself and render him a total slave to the object of his passion in a word human life be more govern by fortune than by reason be to be regard more as a dull pastime than as a serious occupation and be more influence by particular humour than by general principles shall we engage ourselves in it with passion and anxiety it be not worthy of so much concern shall we be indifferent about what happen we lose all the pleasure of the game by our phlegm and carelessness while we be reason concern life life be go and death though perhaps they receive him differently yet treat alike the fool and the philosopher to reduce life to exact rule and method be commonly a painful oft a fruitless occupation and be it not also a proof that we overvalue the prize for which we contend even to reason so carefully concern it and to fix with accuracy its just idea would be overvalue it be it not that to some temper this occupation be one of the most amuse in which life could possibly be employ essay of polygamy and divorce as marriage be an engagement enter into by mutual consent and have for its end the propagation of the species it be evident that it must be susceptible of all the variety of condition which consent establish provide they be not contrary to this end a man in conjoin himself to a woman be bind to her accord to the term of his engagement in beget children he be bind by all the tie of nature and humanity to provide for their subsistence and education when he have perform these two part of duty no one can reproach him with injustice or injury and as the term of his engagement as well as the methods of subsist his offspring may be various it be mere superstition to imagine that marriage can be entirely uniform and will admit only of one mode or form do not human laws restrain the natural liberty of men every particular marriage would be as different as contract or bargain of any other kind or species as circumstances vary and the laws propose different advantage we find that in different time and place they impose different condition on this important contract in tonquin it be usual for the sailors when the ship come into harbour to marry for the season and notwithstanding this precarious engagement they be assure it be say of the strictest fidelity to their bed as well as in the whole management of their affairs from those temporary spouses can not at present recollect my authorities but have somewhere read that the republic of athens have lose many of its citizens by war and pestilence allow every man to marry two wive in order the sooner to repair the waste which have be make by these calamities the poet euripides happen to be couple to two noisy vixens who so plague him with their jealousies and quarrel that he become ever after a profess woman hater and be the only theatrical writer perhaps the only poet that ever entertain an aversion to the sex in that agreeable romance call the history of thesevarambians where a great many men and a few women be suppose to be shipwreck on a desert coast the captain of the troop in order to obviate those endless quarrel which arise regulate their marriages after the follow manner he take a handsome female to himself alone assign one to every couple of inferior officer and to five of the lowest rank he give one wife in commona the ancient britons have a singular kind of marriage to be meet with among no other people any number of them as ten or a dozen join in a society together which be perhaps requisite for mutual defence in those barbarous time in order to link this society the closer they take an equal number of wive in common and whatever children be bear be repute to belong to all of them and be accordingly provide for by the whole community among the inferior creatures nature herself be the supreme legislator prescribe all the laws which regulate their marriages and vary those laws accord to the different circumstances of the creature where she furnish with ease food and defence to the newborn animal the present embrace terminate the marriage and the care of the offspring be commit entirely to the female where the food be of more difficult purchase the marriage continue for one season till the common progeny can provide for itself and then the union immediately dissolve and leave each of the party free to enter into a new engagement at the ensue season but nature have endow man with reason have not so exactly regulate every article of his marriage contract but have leave him to adjust them by his own prudence accord to his particular circumstances and situation municipal laws be a supply to the wisdom of each individual and at the same time by restrain the natural liberty of men make private interest submit to the interest of the public all regulations therefore on this head be equally lawful and equally conformable to the principles of nature though they be not all equally convenient or equally useful to society the laws may allow of polygamy as among the eastern nations or of voluntary divorce as among the greeks and romans or they may confine one man to one woman during the whole course of their live as among the modern europeans it may not be disagreeable to consider the advantage and disadvantage which result from each of these institutions the advocate for polygamy may recommend it as the only effectual remedy for the disorder of love and the only expedient for free men from that slavery to the females which the natural violence of our passions have impose upon us by this mean alone can we regain our right of sovereignty and sate our appetite reestablish the authority of reason in our mind and of consequence our own authority in our families man like a weak sovereign be unable to support himself against the wiles and intrigue of his subject must play one faction against another and become absolute by the mutual jealousy of the females to divide and to govern be an universal maxim and by neglect it the europeans undergo a more grievous and a more ignominious slavery than the turks or persians who be subject indeed to a sovereign that lie at a distance from them but in their domestic affairs rule with an uncontroulable swayb on the other hand it may be urge with better reason that this sovereignty of the male be a real usurpation and destroy that nearness of rank not to say equality which nature have establish between the sex we be by nature their lovers their friends their patrons would we willingly exchange such endear appellations for the barbarous title of master and tyrant in what capacity shall we gain by this inhuman proceed as lovers or as husband the lover be totally annihilate and courtship the most agreeable scene in life can no longer have place where women have not the free disposal of themselves but be buy and sell like the meanest animal the husband be as little a gainer have find the admirable secret of extinguish every part of love except its jealousy no rise without its thorn but he must be a foolish wretch indeed that throw away the rise and preserve only the thornc but the asiatic manners be as destructive to friendship as to love jealousy exclude men from all intimacies and familiarities with each other no one dare bring his friend to his house or table lest he bring a lover to his numerous wive hence all over the east each family be as much separate from another as if they be so many distinct kingdoms no wonder then that solomon live like an eastern prince with his seven hundred wive and three hundred concubines without one friend could write so pathetically concern the vanity of the world have he try the secret of one wife or mistress a few friends and a great many companion he might have find life somewhat more agreeable destroy love and friendship what remain in the world worth accept the bad education of children especially children of condition be another unavoidable consequence of these eastern institutions those who pass the early part of life among slave be only qualify to be themselves slave and tyrants and in every future intercourse either with their inferiors or superiors be apt to forget the natural equality of mankind what attention too can it be suppose a parent whose seraglio afford him fifty sons will give to instill principles of morality or science into a progeny with whom he himself be scarcely acquaint and whom he love with so divide an affection barbarism therefore appear from reason as well as experience to be the inseparable attendant of polygamyd to render polygamy more odious need not recount the frightful effect of jealousy and the constraint in which it hold the fairsex all over the east in those countries men be not allow to have any commerce with the females not even physicians when sickness may be suppose to have extinguish all wanton passions in the bosom of the fair and at the same time have render them unfit object of desire tournefort tell us that when he be bring into the grand signiors seraglio as a physician he be not a little surprized in look along a gallery to see a great number of naked arm stand out from the side of the room he could not imagine what this could mean till he be tell that those arm belong to body which he must cure without know any more about them than what he could learn from the arm he be not allow to ask a question of the patient or even of her attendants lest he might find it necessary to enquire concern circumstances which the delicacy of the seraglio allow not to be reveal hence physicians in the east pretend to know all diseases from the pulse as our quack in europe undertake to cure a person merely from see his water suppose have monsieurtournefort be of this latter kind he would not in constantinople have be allow by the jealous turks to be furnish with materials requisite for exercise his art in another country where polygamy be also allow they render their wive cripple and make their feet of no use to them in order to confine them to their own house but it will perhaps appear strange that in a european country jealousy can yet be carry to such a height that it be indecent so much as to suppose that a woman of rank can have feet or legse witness the follow story which we have from very good authority when the mother of the late king of spain be on her road towards madrid she pass through a little town in spain famous for its manufactory of gloves and stock the magistrates of the place think they could not better express their joy for the reception of their new queen than by present her with a sample of those commodities for which alone their town be remarkable the major domo who conduct the princess receive the gloves very graciously but when the stock be present he fling them away with great indignation and severely reprimand the magistrates for this egregious piece of indecency know say he that a queen ofspainhas no legs the young queen who at that time understand the language but imperfectly and have often be frighten with stories of spanish jealousy imagine that they be to cut off her legs upon which she fell a cry and beg them to conduct her back to germany for that she never could endure the operation and it be with some difficulty they could appease her philip be say never in his life to have laugh heartily but at the recital of this storyf have reject polygamy and match one man with one woman let us now consider what duration we shall assign to their union and whether we shall admit of those voluntary divorce which be customary among the greeks and romans those who would defend this practice may employ the follow reason how often do disgust and aversion arise after marriage from the most trivial accidents or from an incompatibility of humour where time instead of cure the wound proceed from mutual injuries fester them every day the more by new quarrel and reproach let us separate hearts which be not make to associate together each of them may perhaps find another for which it be better fit at least nothing can be more cruel than to preserve by violence an union which at first be make by mutual love and be now in effect dissolve by mutual hatred but the liberty of divorce be not only a cure to hatred and domestic quarrel it be also an admirable preservative against them and the only secret for keep alive that love which first unite the marry couple the heart of man delight in liberty the very image of constraint be grievous to it when you would confine it by violence to what would otherwise have be its choice the inclination immediately change and desire be turn into aversion if the public interest will not allow us to enjoy in polygamy that variety which be so agreeable in love at least deprive us not of that liberty which be so essentially requisite in vain you tell me that have my choice of the person with whom would conjoin myself have my choice it be true of my prison but this be but a small comfort since it must still be a prison such be the arguments which may be urge in favour of divorce but there seem to be these three unanswerable objections against them first what must become of the children upon the separation of the parent must they be commit to the care of a stepmother and instead of the fond attention and concern of a parent feel all the indifference or hatred of a stranger or an enemy these inconveniencies be sufficiently felt where nature have make the divorce by the doom inevitable to all mortals and shall we seek to multiply those inconveniencies by multiply divorce and put it in the power of parent upon every caprice to render their posterity miserable secondly if it be true on the one hand that the heart of man naturally delight in liberty and hat every thing to which it be confine it be also true on the other that the heart of man naturally submit to necessity and soon lose an inclination when there appear an absolute impossibility of gratify it these principles of human nature youll say be contradictory but what be man but a heap of contradictions though it be remarkable that where principles be after this manner contrary in their operation they do not always destroy each other but the one or the other may predominate on any particular occasion accord as circumstances be more or less favourable to it for instance love be a restless and impatient passion full of caprices and variations arise in a moment from a feature from an air from nothing and suddenly extinguish after the same manner such a passion require liberty above all things and therefore eloisa have reason when in order to preserve this passion she refuse to marry her beloved abelard how oft when prest to marriage have say curse on all laws but those which love have make love free as air at sight of human tie spread his light wing and in a moment fly but friendship be a calm and sedate affection conduct by reason and cement by habit spring from long acquaintance and mutual obligations without jealousies or fear and without those feverish fit of heat and cold which cause such an agreeable torment in the amorous passion so sober an affection therefore as friendship rather thrive under constraint and never rise to such a height as when any strong interest or necessity bind two persons together and give them some common object of pursuitg we need not therefore be afraid of draw the marriageknot which chiefly subsist by friendship the closest possible the amity between the persons where it be solid and sincere will rather gain by it and where it be waver and uncertain this be the best expedient for fix it how many frivolous quarrel and disgust be there which people of common prudence endeavour to forget when they lie under a necessity of pass their live together but which would soon be inflame into the most deadly hatred be they pursue to the utmost under the prospect of an easy separation in the third place we must consider that nothing be more dangerous than to unite two persons so closely in all their interest and concern as man and wife without render the union entire and total the least possibility of a separate interest must be the source of endless quarrel and suspicions the wife not secure of her establishment will still be drive some separate end or projecth and the husband selfishness be accompany with more power may be still more dangerous should these reason against voluntary divorce be deem insufficient hope no body will pretend to refuse the testimony of experience at the time when divorce be most frequent among the romans marriages be most rare and augustus be oblige by penal laws to force men of fashion into the marry state a circumstance which be scarcely to be find in any other age or nationi the more ancient laws of rome which prohibit divorce be extremely praise by dionysius halycarnassæus wonderful be the harmony say the historian which this inseparable union of interest produce between marry persons while each of them consider the inevitable necessity by which they be link together and abandon all prospect of any other choice or establishment the exclusion of polygamy and divorce sufficiently recommend our present european practice with regard to marriage essay of simplicity and refinement in write fine write accord to mr addison consist of sentiments which be natural without be obvious there can not be a juster and more concise definition of fine write sentiments which be merely natural affect not the mind with any pleasure and seem not worthy of our attention the pleasantries of a waterman the observations of a peasant the ribaldry of a porter or hackney coachman all of these be natural and disagreeable what an insipid comedy should we make of the chitchat of the teatable copy faithfully and at full length nothing can please persons of taste but nature draw with all her grace and ornament la belle nature or if we copy low life the stroke must be strong and remarkable and must convey a lively image to the mind the absurd naivetya of sancho pancho be represent in such inimitable colour by cervantes that it entertain as much as the picture of the most magnanimous hero or softest lover the case be the same with orators philosophers critics or any author who speak in his own person without introduce other speakers or actors if his language be not elegant his observations uncommon his sense strong and masculine he will in vain boast his nature and simplicity he may be correct but he never will be agreeable it be the unhappiness of such author that they be never blame or censure the good fortune of a book and that of a man be not the same the secret deceive path of life which horace talk of fallentis semita vitæ may be the happiest lot of the one but be the greatest misfortune which the other can possibly fall into on the other hand productions which be merely surprise without be natural can never give any last entertainment to the mind to draw chimeras be not properly speak to copy or imitate the justness of the representation be lose and the mind be displease to find a picture which bear no resemblance to any original nor be such excessive refinements more agreeable in the epistolary or philosophic style than in the epic or tragic too much ornament be a fault in every kind of production uncommon expressions strong flash of wit point similies and epigrammatic turn especially when they recur too frequently be a disfigurement rather than any embellishment of discourse as the eye in survey a gothic build be distract by the multiplicity of ornament and lose the whole by its minute attention to the part so the mind in peruse a work overstock with wit be fatigue and disgust with the constant endeavour to shine and surprize this be the case where a writer overabounds in wit even though that wit in itself should be just and agreeable but it commonly happen to such writers that they seek for their favourite ornament even where the subject do not afford them and by that mean have twenty insipid conceits for one think which be really beautiful there be no subject in critical learn more copious than this of the just mixture of simplicity and refinement in write and therefore not to wander in too large a field shall confine myself to a few general observations on that head first observe that though excesses of both kinds be to be avoid and though a proper medium ought to be study in all productions yet this medium lie not in a point but admit of a considerable latitude consider the wide distance in this respect between mr pope and lucretius these seem to lie in the two greatest extremes of refinement and simplicity in which a poet can indulge himself without be guilty of any blameable excess all this interval may be fill with poets who may differ from each other but may be equally admirable each in his peculiar stile and manner corneille and congreve who carry their wit and refinement somewhat farther than mr pope if poets of so different a kind can be compare together and sophocles and terence who be more simple than lucretius seem to have go out of that medium in which the most perfect productions be find and to be guilty of some excess in these opposite character of all the great poets virgil and racine in my opinion lie nearest the center and be the farthest remove from both the extremities my second observation on this head be that it be very difficult if not impossible to explain by word where the just medium lie between the excesses of simplicity and refinement or to give any rule by which we can know precisely the bound between the fault and the beauty a critic may not only discourse very judiciously on this head without instruct his readers but even without understand the matter perfectly himself there be not a finer piece of criticism than the dissertation on pastorals by fontenelle in which by a number of reflections and philosophical reason he endeavour to fix the just medium which be suitable to that species of write but let any one read the pastorals of that author and he will be convince that this judicious critic notwithstanding his fine reason have a false taste and fix the point of perfection much nearer the extreme of refinement than pastoral poetry will admit of the sentiments of his shepherd be better suit to the toilettes of paris than to the forest of arcadia but this it be impossible to discover from his critical reason he blame all excessive paint and ornament as much as virgil could have do have that great poet writ a dissertation on this species of poetry however different the taste of men their general discourse on these subject be commonly the same no criticism can be instructive which descend not to particulars and be not full of examples and illustrations it be allow on all hand that beauty as well as virtue always lie in a medium but where this medium be place be the great question and can never be sufficiently explain by general reason shall deliver it as a third observation on this subject that we ought to be more on our guard against the excess of refinement than that of simplicity and that because the former excess be both less beautiful and more dangerous than the latter it be a certain rule that wit and passion be entirely incompatible when the affections be move there be no place for the imagination the mind of man be naturally limit it be impossible that all its faculties can operate at once and the more any one predominate the less room be there for the others to exert their vigour for this reason a greater degree of simplicity be require in all compositions where men and action and passions be paint than in such as consist of reflections and observations and as the former species of write be the more engage and beautiful one may safely upon this account give the preference to the extreme of simplicity above that of refinement we may also observe that those compositions which we read the oftenest and which every man of taste have get by heart have the recommendation of simplicity and have nothing surprizing in the think when divest of that elegance of expression and harmony of number with which it be cloathed if the merit of the composition lie in a point of wit it may strike at first but the mind anticipate the think in the second perusal and be no longer affect by it when read an epigram of martial the first line recall the whole and have no pleasure in repeat to myself what know already but each line each word in catullus have its merit and be never tire with the perusal of him it be sufficient to run over cowley once but parnel after the fiftieth read be as fresh as at the first besides it be with book as with women where a certain plainness of manner and of dress be more engage than that glare of paint and air and apparel which may dazzle the eye but reach not the affections terence be a modest and bashful beauty to whom we grant every thing because he assume nothing and whose purity and nature make a durable though not a violent impression on us but refinement as it be the less beautiful so be it the more dangerous extreme and what we be the aptest to fall into simplicity pass for dulness when it be not accompany with great elegance and propriety on the contrary there be something surprizing in a blaze of wit and conceit ordinary readers be mightily strike with it and falsely imagine it to be the most difficult as well as most excellent way of write seneca abound with agreeable fault say quintilian abundat dulcibus vitiis and for that reason be the more dangerous and the more apt to pervert the taste of the young and inconsiderate shall add that the excess of refinement be now more to be guard against than ever because it be the extreme which men be the most apt to fall into after learn have make some progress and after eminent writers have appear in every species of composition the endeavour to please by novelty lead men wide of simplicity and nature and fill their write with affectation and conceit it be thus the asiatic eloquence degenerate so much from the atticb it be thus the age of claudius and nero become so much inferior to that of augustus in taste and genius and perhaps there be at present some symptoms of a like degeneracy of taste in france as well as in england essay of national character thevulgar be apt to carry all national character to extremes and have once establish it as a principle that any people be knavish or cowardly or ignorant they will admit of no exception but comprehend every individual under the same censure men of sense condemn these undistinguishing judgments though at the same time they allow that each nation have a peculiar set of manners and that some particular qualities be more frequently to be meet with among one people than among their neighbour the common people in switzerland have probably more honesty than those of the same rank in ireland and every prudent man will from that circumstance alone make a difference in the trust which he repose in each we have reason to expect greater wit and gaiety in a frenchman than in a spaniard though cervantes be bear in spain an englishman will naturally be suppose to have more knowledge than a dane though tycho brahe be a native of denmark different reason be assign for these national character while some account for them from moral others from physical cause by moral cause mean all circumstances which be fit to work on the mind as motives or reason and which render a peculiar set of manners habitual to us of this kind be the nature of the government the revolutions of public affairs the plenty or penury in which the people live the situation of the nation with regard to its neighbour and such like circumstances by physical cause mean those qualities of the air and climate which be suppose to work insensibly on the temper by alter the tone and habit of the body and give a particular complexion which though reflection and reason may sometimes overcome it will yet prevail among the generality of mankind and have an influence on their manners that the character of a nation will much depend on moral cause must be evident to the most superficial observer since a nation be nothing but a collection of individuals and the manners of individuals be frequently determine by these cause as poverty and hard labour debase the mind of the common people and render them unfit for any science and ingenious profession so where any government become very oppressive to all its subject it must have a proportional effect on their temper and genius and must banish all the liberal arts from among thema the same principle of moral cause fix the character of different professions and alter even that disposition which the particular members receive from the hand of nature a soldier and a priest be different character in all nations and all age and this difference be found on circumstances whose operation be eternal and unalterable the uncertainty of their life make soldier lavish and generous as well as brave their idleness together with the large societies which they form in camp or garrison incline them to pleasure and gallantry by their frequent change of company they acquire good breed and an openness of behaviour be employ only against a public and an open enemy they become candid honest and undesigning and as they use more the labour of the body than that of the mind they be commonly thoughtless and ignorant it be a trite but not altogether a false maxim that priests of all religions be the same and though the character of the profession will not in every instance prevail over the personal character yet be it sure always to predominate with the greater number for as chymists observe that spirit when raise to a certain height be all the same from whatever materials they be extract so these men be elevate above humanity acquire a uniform character which be entirely their own and which in my opinion be generally speak not the most amiable that be to be meet with in human society it be in most point opposite to that of a soldier as be the way of life from which it be derive as to physical cause be incline to doubt altogether of their operation in this particular nor do think that men owe any thing of their temper or genius to the air food or climate confess that the contrary opinion may justly at first sight seem probable since we find that these circumstances have an influence over every other animal and that even those creatures which be fit to live in all climates such as dog horse c do not attain the same perfection in all the courage of bulldog and gamecocks seem peculiar to england flanders be remarkable for large and heavy horse spain for horse light and of good mettle and any breed of these creatures transplant from one country to another will soon lose the qualities which they derive from their native climate it may be ask why not the same with men d there be few question more curious than this or which will oftener occur in our enquiries concern human affairs and therefore it may be proper to give it a full examination the human mind be of a very imitative nature nor be it possible for any set of men to converse often together without acquire a similitude of manners and communicate to each other their vices as well as virtues the propensity to company and society be strong in all rational creatures and the same disposition which give us this propensity make us enter deeply into each others sentiments and cause like passions and inclinations to run as it be by contagion through the whole club or knot of companion where a number of men be unite into one political body the occasion of their intercourse must be so frequent for defence commerce and government that together with the same speech or language they must acquire a resemblance in their manners and have a common or national character as well as a personal one peculiar to each individual now though nature produce all kinds of temper and understand in great abundance it do not follow that she always produce them in like proportion and that in every society the ingredients of industry and indolence valour and cowardice humanity and brutality wisdom and folly will be mix after the same manner in the infancy of society if any of these dispositions be find in greater abundance than the rest it will naturally prevail in the composition and give a tincture to the national character or should it be assert that no species of temper can reasonably be presume to predominate even in those contract societies and that the same proportion will always be preserve in the mixture yet surely the persons in credit and authority be still a more contract body can not always be presume to be of the same character and their influence on the manners of the people must at all time be very considerable if on the first establishment of a republic a brutus should be place in authority and be transport with such an enthusiasm for liberty and public good as to overlook all the tie of nature as well as private interest such an illustrious example will naturally have an effect on the whole society and kindle the same passion in every bosom whatever it be that form the manners of one generation the next must imbibe a deeper tincture of the same dye men be more susceptible of all impressions during infancy and retain these impressions as long as they remain in the world assert then that all national character where they depend not on fix moral cause proceed from such accidents as these and that physical cause have no discernible operation on the human mind it be a maxim in all philosophy that cause which do not appear be to be consider as not existingf if we run over the globe or revolve the annals of history we shall discover every where sign of a sympathy or contagion of manners none of the influence of air or climate first we may observe that where a very extensive government have be establish for many centuries it spread a national character over the whole empire and communicate to every part a similarity of manners thus the chinese have the greatest uniformity of character imaginable though the air and climate in different part of those vast dominions admit of very considerable variations secondly in small governments which be contiguous the people have notwithstanding a different character and be often as distinguishable in their manners as the most distant nations athens and thebes be but a short days journey from each other though the athenians be as remarkable for ingenuity politeness and gaiety as the thebans for dulness rusticity and a phlegmatic temper plutarch discourse of the effect of air on the mind of men observe that the inhabitants of the piræum possess very different temper from those of the higher town in athens which be distant about four miles from the former but believe no one attribute the difference of manners in wapping and st jam to a difference of air or climate thirdly the same national character commonly follow the authority of government to a precise boundary and upon cross a river or pass a mountain one find a new set of manners with a new government the languedocians and gascons be the gayest people in france but whenever you pass the pyrenees you be among spaniards be it conceivable that the qualities of the air should change exactly with the limit of an empire which depend so much on the accidents of battle negociations and marriages fourthly where any set of men scatter over distant nations maintain a close society or communication together they acquire a similitude of manners and have but little in common with the nations amongst whom they live thus the jews in europe and the armenians in the east have a peculiar character and the former be as much note for fraud as the latter for probity the jesuits in all romancatholic countries be also observe to have a character peculiar to themselves fifthly where any accident as a difference in language or religion keep two nations inhabit the same country from mix with each other they will preserve during several centuries a distinct and even opposite set of manners the integrity gravity and bravery of the turks form an exact contrast to the deceit levity and cowardice of the modern greeks sixthly the same set of manners will follow a nation and adhere to them over the whole globe as well as the same laws and language the spanish english french and dutch colonies be all distinguishable even between the tropics seventhly the manners of a people change very considerably from one age to another either by great alterations in their government by the mixtures of new people or by that inconstancy to which all human affairs be subject the ingenuity industry and activity of the ancient greeks have nothing in common with the stupidity and indolence of the present inhabitants of those regions candour bravery and love of liberty form the character of the ancient romans as subtilty cowardice and a slavish disposition do that of the modern the old spaniards be restless turbulent and so addict to war that many of them kill themselves when deprive of their arm by the romans one would find an equal difficulty at present at least one would have find it fifty years ago to rouze up the modern spaniards to arm the batavians be all soldier of fortune and hire themselves into the roman armies their posterity make use of foreigners for the same purpose that the romans do their ancestors though some few stroke of the french character be the same with that which cæsar have ascribe to the gauls yet what comparison between the civility humanity and knowledge of the modern inhabitants of that country and the ignorance barbarity and grossness of the ancient not to insist upon the great difference between the present possessors of britain and those before the roman conquest we may observe that our ancestors a few centuries ago be sink into the most abject superstition last century they be inflame with the most furious enthusiasm and be now settle into the most cool indifference with regard to religious matter that be to be find in any nation of the worldh eighthly where several neighbour nations have a very close communication together either by policy commerce or travel they acquire a similitude of manners proportion to the communication thus all the frank appear to have a uniform character to the eastern nations the differences among them be like the peculiar accent of different provinces which be not distinguishable except by an ear accustom to them and which commonly escape a foreigner ninthly we may often remark a wonderful mixture of manners and character in the same nation speak the same language and subject to the same government and in this particular the english be the most remarkable of any people that perhaps ever be in the world nor be this to be ascribe to the mutability and uncertainty of their climate or to any other physical cause since all these cause take place in the neighbour country of scotland without have the same effect where the government of a nation be altogether republican it be apt to beget a peculiar set of manners where it be altogether monarchical it be more apt to have the same effect the imitation of superiors spread the national manners faster among the people if the govern part of a state consist altogether of merchants as in holland their uniform way of life will fix their character if it consist chiefly of nobles and land gentry like germany france and spain the same effect follow the genius of a particular sect or religion be also apt to mould the manners of a people but the english government be a mixture of monarchy aristocracy and democracy the people in authority be compose of gentry and merchants all sects of religion be to be find among them and the great liberty and independency which every man enjoy allow him to display the manners peculiar to him hence the english of any people in the universe have the least of a national character unless this very singularity may pass for such if the character of men depend on the air and climate the degrees of heat and cold should naturally be expect to have a mighty influence since nothing have a greater effect on all plant and irrational animals and indeed there be some reason to think that all the nations which live beyond the polar circle or between the tropics be inferior to the rest of the species and be incapable of all the higher attainments of the human mind the poverty and misery of the northern inhabitants of the globe and the indolence of the southern from their few necessities may perhaps account for this remarkable difference without our have recourse to physical cause this however be certain that the character of nations be very promiscuous in the temperate climates and that almost all the general observations which have be form of the more southern or more northern people in these climates be find to be uncertain and fallacious shall we say that the neighbourhood of the sun inflame the imagination of men and give it a peculiar spirit and vivacity the french greeks egyptians and persians be remarkable for gaiety the spaniards turks and chinese be note for gravity and a serious deportment without any such difference of climate as to produce this difference of temper the greeks and romans who call all other nations barbarians confine genius and a fine understand to the more southern climates and pronounce the northern nations incapable of all knowledge and civility but our island have produce as great men either for action or learn as greece or italy have to boast of it be pretend that the sentiments of men become more delicate as the country approach nearer to the sun and that the taste of beauty and elegance receive proportional improvements in every latitude as we may particularly observe of the languages of which the more southern be smooth and melodious the northern harsh and untuneable but this observation hold not universally the arabic be uncouth and disagreeable the muscovite soft and musical energy strength and harshness form the character of the latin tongue the italian be the most liquid smooth and effeminate language that can possibly be imagine every language will depend somewhat on the manners of the people but much more on that original stock of word and sound which they receive from their ancestors and which remain unchangeable even while their manners admit of the greatest alterations who can doubt but the english be at present a more polite and know people than the greeks be for several age after the siege of troy yet be there no comparison between the language of milton and that of homer nay the greater be the alterations and improvements which happen in the manners of a people the less can be expect in their language a few eminent and refine geniuses will communicate their taste and knowledge to a whole people and produce the greatest improvements but they fix the tongue by their write and prevent in some degree its farther change lord bacon have observe that the inhabitants of the south be in general more ingenious than those of the north but that where the native of a cold climate have genius he rise to a higher pitch than can be reach by the southern wits this observation a late writer confirm by compare the southern wits to cucumbers which be commonly all good in their kind but at best be an insipid fruit while the northern geniuses be like melons of which not one in fifty be good but when it be so it have an exquisite relish believe this remark may be allow just when confine to the european nations and to the present age or rather to the precede one but think it may be account for from moral cause all the sciences and liberal arts have be import to us from the south and it be easy to imagine that in the first ardor of application when excite by emulation and by glory the few who be addict to them would carry them to the greatest height and stretch every nerve and every faculty to reach the pinnacle of perfection such illustrious examples spread knowledge every where and beget an universal esteem for the sciences after which it be no wonder that industry relax while men meet not with suitable encouragement nor arrive at such distinction by their attainments the universal diffusion of learn among a people and the entire banishment of gross ignorance and rusticity be therefore seldom attend with any remarkable perfection in particular persons it seem to be take for grant in the dialogue de oratoribus that knowledge be much more common in vespasians age than in that of cicero and augustus quintilian also complain of the profanation of learn by its become too commonj formerly say juvenal science be confine to greece and italy now the whole world emulate athens and rome eloquent gaul have teach britain know in the laws even thule entertain thoughts of hire rhetoricians for its instruction this state of learn be remarkable because juvenal be himself the last of the roman writers that possess any degree of genius those who succeed be value for nothing but the matter of fact of which they give us information hope the late conversion of muscovy to the study of the sciences will not prove a like prognostic to the present period of learn cardinal bentivoglio give the preference to the northern nations above the southern with regard to candour and sincerity and mention on the one hand the spaniards and italians and on the other the flemings and germans but be apt to think that this have happen by accident the ancient romans seem to have be a candid sincere people as be the modern turks but if we must need suppose that this event have arise from fix cause we may only conclude from it that all extremes be apt to concur and be commonly attend with the same consequences treachery be the usual concomitant of ignorance and barbarism and if civilize nations ever embrace subtle and crook politics it be from an excess of refinement which make them disdain the plain direct path to power and glory most conquests have go from north to south and it have hence be infer that the northern nations possess a superior degree of courage and ferocity but it would have be juster to have say that most conquests be make by poverty and want upon plenty and riches the saracens leave the desert of arabia carry their conquests northwards upon all the fertile provinces of the roman empire and meet the turks half way who be come southwards from the desert of tartary an eminent writer have remark that all courageous animals be also carnivorous and that greater courage be to be expect in a people such as the english whose food be strong and hearty than in the halfstarved commonalty of other countries but the swedes notwithstanding their disadvantage in this particular be not inferior in martial courage to any nation that ever be in the world in general we may observe that courage of all national qualities be the most precarious because it be exert only at intervals and by a few in every nation whereas industry knowledge civility may be of constant and universal use and for several age may become habitual to the whole people if courage be preserve it must be by discipline example and opinion the tenth legion of cæsar and the regiment of picardy in france be form promiscuously from among the citizens but have once entertain a notion that they be the best troop in the service this very opinion really make them such as a proof how much courage depend on opinion we may observe that of the two chief tribes of the greeks the dorians and ionians the former be always esteem and always appear more brave and manly than the latter though the colonies of both the tribes be intersperse and intermingle throughout all the extent of greece the lesser asia sicily italy and the islands of the ægean sea the athenians be the only ionians that ever have any reputation for valour or military atchievements though even these be deem inferior to the lacedemonians the bravest of the dorians the only observation with regard to the difference of men in different climates on which we can rest any weight be the vulgar one that people in the northern regions have a greater inclination to strong liquors and those in the southern to love and women one can assign a very probable physical cause for this difference wine and distil water warm the freeze blood in the colder climates and fortify men against the injuries of the weather as the genial heat of the sun in the countries expose to his beam inflame the blood and exalt the passion between the sex perhaps too the matter may be account for by moral cause all strong liquors be rarer in the north and consequently be more covet diodorus siculus tell us that the gauls in his time be great drunkards and much addict to wine chiefly suppose from its rarity and novelty on the other hand the heat in the southern climates oblige men and women to go half naked thereby render their frequent commerce more dangerous and inflame their mutual passion this make parent and husband more jealous and reserve which still farther inflame the passion not to mention that as women ripen sooner in the southern regions it be necessary to observe greater jealousy and care in their education it be evident that a girl of twelve can not possess equal discretion to govern this passion with one who feel not its violence till she be seventeen or eighteen nothing so much encourage the passion of love as ease and leisure or be more destructive to it than industry and hard labour and as the necessities of men be evidently fewer in the warm climates than in the cold ones this circumstance alone may make a considerable difference between theml but perhaps the fact be doubtful that nature have either from moral or physical cause distribute these respective inclinations to the different climates the ancient greeks though bear in a warm climate seem to have be much addict to the bottle nor be their party of pleasure any thing but match of drink among men who pass their time altogether apart from the fair yet when alexander lead the greeks into persia a still more southern climate they multiply their debauch of this kind in imitation of the persian manners so honourable be the character of a drunkard among the persians that cyrus the younger solicit the sober lacedemonians for succour against his brother artaxerxes claim it chiefly on account of his superior endowments as more valorous more bountiful and a better drinkerdarius hystaspes make it be inscribe on his tombstone among his other virtues and princely qualities that no one could bear a greater quantity of liquor you may obtain any thing of the negroes by offer them strong drink and may easily prevail with them to sell not only their children but their wive and mistresses for a cask of brandy in france and italy few drink pure wine except in the greatest heat of summer and indeed it be then almost as necessary in order to recruit the spirit evaporate by heat as it be in sweden during the winter in order to warm the body congeal by the rigour of the season if jealousy be regard as a proof of an amorous disposition no people be more jealous than the muscovites before their communication with europe have somewhat alter their manners in this particular but suppose the fact true that nature by physical principles have regularly distribute these two passions the one to the northern the other to the southern regions we can only infer that the climate may affect the grosser and more bodily organs of our frame not that it can work upon those finer organs on which the operations of the mind and understand depend and this be agreeable to the analogy of nature the race of animals never degenerate when carefully tend and horse in particular always show their blood in their shape spirit and swiftness but a coxcomb may beget a philosopher as a man of virtue may leave a worthless progeny shall conclude this subject with observe that though the passion for liquor be more brutal and debase than love which when properly manage be the source of all politeness and refinement yet this give not so great an advantage to the southern climates as we may be apt at first sight to imagine when love go beyond a certain pitch it render men jealous and cut off the free intercourse between the sex on which the politeness of a nation will commonly much depend and if we would subtilize and refine upon this point we might observe that the people in very temperate climates be the most likely to attain all sort of improvement their blood not be so inflame as to render them jealous and yet be warm enough to make them set a due value on the charm and endowments of the fair sex essay of tragedy it seem an unaccountable pleasure which the spectators of a wellwritten tragedy receive from sorrow terror anxiety and other passions that be in themselves disagreeable and uneasy the more they be touch and affect the more be they delight with the spectacle and as soon as the uneasy passions cease to operate the piece be at an end one scene of full joy and contentment and security be the utmost that any composition of this kind can bear and it be sure always to be the conclude one if in the texture of the piece there be interweave any scenes of satisfaction they afford only faint gleam of pleasure which be throw in by way of variety and in order to plunge the actors into deeper distress by mean of that contrast and disappointment the whole art of the poet be employ in rouzing and support the compassion and indignation the anxiety and resentment of his audience they be please in proportion as they be afflict and never be so happy as when they employ tear sob and cry to give vent to their sorrow and relieve their heart swoln with the tenderest sympathy and compassion the few critics who have have some tincture of philosophy have remark this singular phænomenon and have endeavour to account for it labbe dubos in his reflections on poetry and paint assert that nothing be in general so disagreeable to the mind as the languid listless state of indolence into which it fall upon the removal of all passion and occupation to get rid of this painful situation it seek every amusement and pursuit business game shew executions whatever will rouze the passions and take its attention from itself no matter what the passion be let it be disagreeable afflict melancholy disorder it be still better than that insipid languor which arise from perfect tranquillity and repose it be impossible not to admit this account as be at least in part satisfactory you may observe when there be several table of game that all the company run to those where the deepest play be even though they find not there the best players the view or at least imagination of high passions arise from great loss or gain affect the spectator by sympathy give him some touch of the same passions and serve him for a momentary entertainment it make the time pass the easier with him and be some relief to that oppression under which men commonly labour when leave entirely to their own thoughts and meditations we find that common liars always magnify in their narrations all kinds of danger pain distress sickness deaths murder and cruelties as well as joy beauty mirth and magnificence it be an absurd secret which they have for please their company fix their attention and attach them to such marvellous relations by the passions and emotions which they excite there be however a difficulty in apply to the present subject in its full extent this solution however ingenious and satisfactory it may appear it be certain that the same object of distress which please in a tragedy be it really set before us would give the most unfeigned uneasiness though it be then the most effectual cure to languor and indolence monsieur fontenelle seem to have be sensible of this difficulty and accordingly attempt another solution of the phænomenon at least make some addition to the theory above mention pleasure and pain say he which be two sentiments so different in themselves differ not so much in their cause from the instance of tickle it appear that the movement of pleasure push a little too far become pain and that the movement of pain a little moderate become pleasure hence it proceed that there be such a thing as a sorrow soft and agreeable it be a pain weaken and diminish the heart like naturally to be move and affect melancholy object suit it and even disastrous and sorrowful provide they be soften by some circumstance it be certain that on the theatre the representation have almost the effect of reality yet it have not altogether that effect however we may be hurry away by the spectacle whatever dominion the sense and imagination may usurp over the reason there still lurk at the bottom a certain idea of falsehood in the whole of what we see this idea though weak and disguise suffice to diminish the pain which we suffer from the misfortunes of those whom we love and to reduce that affliction to such a pitch as convert it into a pleasure we weep for the misfortune of a hero to whom we be attach in the same instant we comfort ourselves by reflect that it be nothing but a fiction and it be precisely that mixture of sentiments which compose an agreeable sorrow and tear that delight us but as that affliction which be cause by exterior and sensible object be stronger than the consolation which arise from an internal reflection they be the effect and symptoms of sorrow that ought to predominate in the composition this solution seem just and convince but perhaps it want still some new addition in order to make it answer fully the phænomenon which we here examine all the passions excite by eloquence be agreeable in the highest degree as well as those which be move by paint and the theatre the epilogues of cicero be on this account chiefly the delight of every reader of taste and it be difficult to read some of them without the deepest sympathy and sorrow his merit as an orator no doubt depend much on his success in this particular when he have raise tear in his judge and all his audience they be then the most highly delight and express the greatest satisfaction with the pleader the pathetic description of the butchery make by verres of the sicilian captain be a masterpiece of this kind but believe none will affirm that the be present at a melancholy scene of that nature would afford any entertainment neither be the sorrow here soften by fiction for the audience be convince of the reality of every circumstance what be it then which in this case raise a pleasure from the bosom of uneasiness so to speak and a pleasure which still retain all the feature and outward symptoms of distress and sorrow answer this extraordinary effect proceed from that very eloquence with which the melancholy scene be represent the genius require to paint object in a lively manner the art employ in collect all the pathetic circumstances the judgment display in dispose them the exercise say of these noble talents together with the force of expression and beauty of oratorial number diffuse the highest satisfaction on the audience and excite the most delightful movements by this mean the uneasiness of the melancholy passions be not only overpower and efface by something stronger of an opposite kind but the whole impulse of those passions be convert into pleasure and swell the delight which the eloquence raise in us the same force of oratory employ on an uninteresting subject would not please half so much or rather would appear altogether ridiculous and the mind be leave in absolute calmness and indifference would relish none of those beauties of imagination or expression which if join to passion give it such exquisite entertainment the impulse or vehemence arise from sorrow compassion indignation receive a new direction from the sentiments of beauty the latter be the predominant emotion seize the whole mind and convert the former into themselves at least tincture them so strongly as totally to alter their nature and the soul be at the same time rouzed by passion and charm by eloquence feel on the whole a strong movement which be altogether delightful the same principle take place in tragedy with this addition that tragedy be an imitation and imitation be always of itself agreeable this circumstance serve still farther to smooth the motion of passion and convert the whole feel into one uniform and strong enjoyment object of the greatest terror and distress please in paint and please more than the most beautiful object that appear calm and indifferent the affection rouzing the mind excite a large stock of spirit and vehemence which be all transform into pleasure by the force of the prevail movement it be thus the fiction of tragedy soften the passion by an infusion of a new feel not merely by weaken or diminish the sorrow you may by degrees weaken a real sorrow till it totally disappear yet in none of its gradations will it ever give pleasure except perhaps by accident to a man sink under lethargic indolence whom it rouzes from that languid state to confirm this theory it will be sufficient to produce other instance where the subordinate movement be convert into the predominant and give force to it though of a different and even sometimes though of a contrary nature novelty naturally rouzes the mind and attract our attention and the movements which it cause be always convert into any passion belong to the object and join their force to it whether an event excite joy or sorrow pride or shame anger or goodwill it be sure to produce a stronger affection when new or unusual and though novelty of itself be agreeable it fortify the painful as well as agreeable passions have you any intention to move a person extremely by the narration of any event the best method of encreasing its effect would be artfully to delay inform him of it and first to excite his curiosity and impatience before you let him into the secret this be the artifice practise by iago in the famous scene of shakespeare and every spectator be sensible that othellos jealousy acquire additional force from his precede impatience and that the subordinate passion be here readily transform into the predominant one difficulties encrease passions of every kind and by rouzing our attention and excite our active power they produce an emotion which nourish the prevail affection parent commonly love that child most whose sickly infirm frame of body have occasion them the greatest pain trouble and anxiety in rear him the agreeable sentiment of affection here acquire force from sentiments of uneasiness nothing endear so much a friend as sorrow for his death the pleasure of his company have not so powerful an influence jealousy be a painful passion yet without some share of it the agreeable affection of love have difficulty to subsist in its full force and violence absence be also a great source of complaint among lovers and give them the greatest uneasiness yet nothing be more favourable to their mutual passion than short intervals of that kind and if long intervals often prove fatal it be only because through time men be accustom to them and they cease to give uneasiness jealousy and absence in love compose the dolce peccante of the italians which they suppose so essential to all pleasure there be a fine observation of the elder pliny which illustrate the principle here insist on it be very remarkable say he that the last work of celebrate artists which they leave imperfect be always the most prize such as theirisofaristides thetyndaridesofnicomachus themedeaoftimomachus and thevenusofapelles these be value even above their finish productions the break lineaments of the piece and the halfformed idea of the painter be carefully study and our very grief for that curious hand which have be stop by death be an additional encrease to our pleasure these instance and many more might be collect be sufficient to afford us some insight into the analogy of nature and to show us that the pleasure which poets orators and musicians give us by excite grief sorrow indignation compassion be not so extraordinary or paradoxical as it may at first sight appear the force of imagination the energy of expression the power of number the charm of imitation all these be naturally of themselves delightful to the mind and when the object present lay also hold of some affection the pleasure still rise upon us by the conversion of this subordinate movement into that which be predominant the passion though perhaps naturally and when excite by the simple appearance of a real object it may be painful yet be so smooth and soften and mollify when raise by the finer arts that it afford the highest entertainment to confirm this reason we may observe that if the movements of the imagination be not predominant above those of the passion a contrary effect follow and the former be now subordinate be convert into the latter and still farther encreases the pain and affliction of the sufferer who could ever think of it as a good expedient for comfort an afflict parent to exaggerate with all the force of elocution the irreparable loss which he have meet with by the death of a favourite child the more power of imagination and expression you here employ the more you encrease his despair and affliction the shame confusion and terror of verres no doubt rise in proportion to the noble eloquence and vehemence of cicero so also do his pain and uneasiness these former passions be too strong for the pleasure arise from the beauties of elocution and operate though from the same principle yet in a contrary manner to the sympathy compassion and indignation of the audience lord clarendon when he approach towards the catastrophe of the royal party suppose that his narration must then become infinitely disagreeable and he hurry over the kings death without give us one circumstance of it he consider it as too horrid a scene to be contemplate with any satisfaction or even without the utmost pain and aversion he himself as well as the readers of that age be too deeply concern in the events and felt a pain from subject which an historian and a reader of another age would regard as the most pathetic and most interest and by consequence the most agreeable an action represent in tragedy may be too bloody and atrocious it may excite such movements of horror as will not soften into pleasure and the greatest energy of expression bestow on descriptions of that nature serve only to augment our uneasiness such be that action represent in the ambitious stepmother where a venerable old man raise to the height of fury and despair rush against a pillar and strike his head upon it besmear it all over with mingle brain and gore the english theatre abound too much with such shock image even the common sentiments of compassion require to be soften by some agreeable affection in order to give a thorough satisfaction to the audience the mere suffer of plaintive virtue under the triumphant tyranny and oppression of vice form a disagreeable spectacle and be carefully avoid by all master of the drama in order to dismiss the audience with entire satisfaction and contentment the virtue must either convert itself into a noble courageous despair or the vice receive its proper punishment most painters appear in this light to have be very unhappy in their subject as they work much for church and convents they have chiefly represent such horrible subject as crucifixions and martyrdoms where nothing appear but torture wound executions and passive suffer without any action or affection when they turn their pencil from this ghastly mythology they have commonly recourse to ovid whose fictions though passionate and agreeable be scarcely natural or probable enough for paint the same inversion of that principle which be here insist on display itself in common life as in the effect of oratory and poetry raise so the subordinate passion that it become the predominant it swallow up that affection which it before nourish and encreased too much jealousy extinguish love too much difficulty render us indifferent too much sickness and infirmity disgust a selfish and unkind parent what so disagreeable as the dismal gloomy disastrous stories with which melancholy people entertain their companion the uneasy passion be there raise alone unaccompanied with any spirit genius or eloquence convey a pure uneasiness and be attend with nothing that can soften it into pleasure or satisfaction essay of the standard of taste the great variety of taste as well as of opinion which prevail in the world be too obvious not to have fall under every ones observation men of the most confine knowledge be able to remark a difference of taste in the narrow circle of their acquaintance even where the persons have be educate under the same government and have early imbibe the same prejudice but those who can enlarge their view to contemplate distant nations and remote age be still more surprized at the great inconsistence and contrariety we be apt to call barbarous whatever depart widely from our own taste and apprehension but soon find the epithet of reproach retort on us and the highest arrogance and selfconceit be at last startle on observe an equal assurance on all side and scruple amidst such a contest of sentiment to pronounce positively in its own favour as this variety of taste be obvious to the most careless enquirer so will it be find on examination to be still greater in reality than in appearance the sentiments of men often differ with regard to beauty and deformity of all kinds even while their general discourse be the same there be certain term in every language which import blame and others praise and all men who use the same tongue must agree in their application of them every voice be unite in applaud elegance propriety simplicity spirit in write and in blame fustian affectation coldness and a false brilliancy but when critics come to particulars this seem unanimity vanish and it be find that they have affix a very different mean to their expressions in all matter of opinion and science the case be opposite the difference among men be there oftener find to lie in general than in particulars and to be less in reality than in appearance an explanation of the term commonly end the controversy and the disputants be surprized to find that they have be quarrel while at bottom they agree in their judgment those who find morality on sentiment more than on reason be incline to comprehend ethics under the former observation and to maintain that in all question which regard conduct and manners the difference among men be really greater than at first sight it appear it be indeed obvious that writers of all nations and all age concur in applaud justice humanity magnanimity prudence veracity and in blame the opposite qualities even poets and other author whose compositions be chiefly calculate to please the imagination be yet find from homer down to fenelon to inculcate the same moral precepts and to bestow their applause and blame on the same virtues and vices this great unanimity be usually ascribe to the influence of plain reason which in all these case maintain similar sentiments in all men and prevent those controversies to which the abstract sciences be so much expose so far as the unanimity be real this account may be admit as satisfactory but we must also allow that some part of the seem harmony in morals may be account for from the very nature of language the word virtue with its equivalent in every tongue imply praise as that of vice do blame and no one without the most obvious and grossest impropriety could affix reproach to a term which in general acceptation be understand in a good sense or bestow applause where the idiom require disapprobation homer general precepts where he deliver any such will never be controvert but it be obvious that when he draw particular picture of manners and represent heroism in achilles and prudence in ulysses he intermix a much greater degree of ferocity in the former and of cunning and fraud in the latter than fenelon would admit of the sage ulysses in the greek poet seem to delight in lie and fictions and often employ them without any necessity or even advantage but his more scrupulous son in the french epic writer expose himself to the most imminent peril rather than depart from the most exact line of truth and veracity the admirers and followers of the alcoran insist on the excellent moral precepts intersperse throughout that wild and absurd performance but it be to be suppose that the arabic word which correspond to the english equity justice temperance meekness charity be such as from the constant use of that tongue must always be take in a good sense and it would have argue the greatest ignorance not of morals but of language to have mention them with any epithets besides those of applause and approbation but would we know whether the pretend prophet have really attain a just sentiment of morals let us attend to his narration and we shall soon find that he bestow praise on such instance of treachery inhumanity cruelty revenge bigotry as be utterly incompatible with civilize society no steady rule of right seem there to be attend to and every action be blame or praise so far only as it be beneficial or hurtful to the true believers the merit of deliver true general precepts in ethics be indeed very small whoever recommend any moral virtues really do no more than be imply in the term themselves that people who invent the word charity and use it in a good sense inculcate more clearly and much more efficaciously the precept be charitable than any pretend legislator or prophet who should insert such a maxim in his write of all expressions those which together with their other mean imply a degree either of blame or approbation be the least liable to be pervert or mistake it be natural for us to seek a standard of taste a rule by which the various sentiments of men may be reconcile at least a decision afford confirm one sentiment and condemn another there be a species of philosophy which cut off all hop of success in such an attempt and represent the impossibility of ever attain any standard of taste the difference it be say be very wide between judgment and sentiment all sentiment be right because sentiment have a reference to nothing beyond itself and be always real wherever a man be conscious of it but all determinations of the understand be not right because they have a reference to something beyond themselves to wit real matter of fact and be not always conformable to that standard among a thousand different opinions which different men may entertain of the same subject there be one and but one that be just and true and the only difficulty be to fix and ascertain it on the contrary a thousand different sentiments excite by the same object be all right because no sentiment represent what be really in the object it only mark a certain conformity or relation between the object and the organs or faculties of the mind and if that conformity do not really exist the sentiment could never possibly have be beauty be no quality in things themselves it exist merely in the mind which contemplate them and each mind perceive a different beauty one person may even perceive deformity where another be sensible of beauty and every individual ought to acquiesce in his own sentiment without pretend to regulate those of others to seek the real beauty or real deformity be as fruitless an enquiry as to pretend to ascertain the real sweet or real bitter accord to the disposition of the organs the same object may be both sweet and bitter and the proverb have justly determine it to be fruitless to dispute concern taste it be very natural and even quite necessary to extend this axiom to mental as well as bodily taste and thus common sense which be so often at variance with philosophy especially with the sceptical kind be find in one instance at least to agree in pronounce the same decision but though this axiom by pass into a proverb seem to have attain the sanction of common sense there be certainly a species of common sense which oppose it at least serve to modify and restrain it whoever would assert an equality of genius and elegance between ogilby and milton or bunyan and addison would be think to defend no less an extravagance than if he have maintain a molehill to be as high as teneriffe or a pond as extensive as the ocean though there may be find persons who give the preference to the former author no one pay attention to such a taste and we pronounce without scruple the sentiment of these pretend critics to be absurd and ridiculous the principle of the natural equality of taste be then totally forget and while we admit it on some occasion where the object seem near an equality it appear an extravagant paradox or rather a palpable absurdity where object so disproportioned be compare together it be evident that none of the rule of composition be fix by reason a priori or can be esteem abstract conclusions of the understand from compare those habitudes and relations of ideas which be eternal and immutable their foundation be the same with that of all the practical sciences experience nor be they any thing but general observations concern what have be universally find to please in all countries and in all age many of the beauties of poetry and even of eloquence be found on falsehood and fiction on hyperboles metaphors and an abuse or perversion of term from their natural mean to check the sallies of the imagination and to reduce every expression to geometrical truth and exactness would be the most contrary to the laws of criticism because it would produce a work which by universal experience have be find the most insipid and disagreeable but though poetry can never submit to exact truth it must be confine by rule of art discover to the author either by genius or observation if some negligent or irregular writers have please they have not please by their transgressions of rule or order but in spite of these transgressions they have possess other beauties which be conformable to just criticism and the force of these beauties have be able to overpower censure and give the mind a satisfaction superior to the disgust arise from the blemish ariosto please but not by his monstrous and improbable fictions by his bizarre mixture of the serious and comic style by the want of coherence in his stories or by the continual interruptions of his narration he charm by the force and clearness of his expression by the readiness and variety of his inventions and by his natural picture of the passions especially those of the gay and amorous kind and however his fault may diminish our satisfaction they be not able entirely to destroy it do our pleasure really arise from those part of his poem which we denominate fault this would be no objection to criticism in general it would only be an objection to those particular rule of criticism which would establish such circumstances to be fault and would represent them as universally blameable if they be find to please they can not be fault let the pleasure which they produce be ever so unexpected and unaccountable but though all the general rule of art be found only on experience and on the observation of the common sentiments of human nature we must not imagine that on every occasion the feel of men will be conformable to these rule those finer emotions of the mind be of a very tender and delicate nature and require the concurrence of many favourable circumstances to make them play with facility and exactness accord to their general and establish principles the least exterior hindrance to such small spring or the least internal disorder disturb their motion and confound the operation of the whole machine when we would make an experiment of this nature and would try the force of any beauty or deformity we must choose with care a proper time and place and bring the fancy to a suitable situation and disposition a perfect serenity of mind a recollection of think a due attention to the object if any of these circumstances be want our experiment will be fallacious and we shall be unable to judge of the catholic and universal beauty the relation which nature have place between the form and the sentiment will at least be more obscure and it will require greater accuracy to trace and discern it we shall be able to ascertain its influence not so much from the operation of each particular beauty as from the durable admiration which attend those work that have survive all the caprices of mode and fashion all the mistake of ignorance and envy the same homer who please at athens and rome two thousand years ago be still admire at paris and at london all the change of climate government religion and language have not be able to obscure his glory authority or prejudice may give a temporary vogue to a bad poet or orator but his reputation will never be durable or general when his compositions be examine by posterity or by foreigners the enchantment be dissipate and his fault appear in their true colour on the contrary a real genius the longer his work endure and the more wide they be spread the more sincere be the admiration which he meet with envy and jealousy have too much place in a narrow circle and even familiar acquaintance with his person may diminish the applause due to his performances but when these obstructions be remove the beauties which be naturally fit to excite agreeable sentiments immediately display their energy and while the world endure they maintain their authority over the mind of men it appear then that amidst all the variety and caprice of taste there be certain general principles of approbation or blame whose influence a careful eye may trace in all operations of the mind some particular form or qualities from the original structure of the internal fabric be calculate to please and others to displease and if they fail of their effect in any particular instance it be from some apparent defect or imperfection in the organ a man in a fever would not insist on his palate as able to decide concern flavour nor would one affect with the jaundice pretend to give a verdict with regard to colour in each creature there be a sound and a defective state and the former alone can be suppose to afford us a true standard of taste and sentiment if in the sound state of the organ there be an entire or a considerable uniformity of sentiment among men we may thence derive an idea of the perfect beauty in like manner as the appearance of object in daylight to the eye of a man in health be denominate their true and real colour even while colour be allow to be merely a phantasm of the sense many and frequent be the defect in the internal organs which prevent or weaken the influence of those general principles on which depend our sentiment of beauty or deformity though some object by the structure of the mind be naturally calculate to give pleasure it be not to be expect that in every individual the pleasure will be equally felt particular incidents and situations occur which either throw a false light on the object or hinder the true from convey to the imagination the proper sentiment and perception one obvious cause why many feel not the proper sentiment of beauty be the want of that delicacy of imagination which be requisite to convey a sensibility of those finer emotions this delicacy every one pretend to every one talk of it and would reduce every kind of taste or sentiment to its standard but as our intention in this essay be to mingle some light of the understand with the feel of sentiment it will be proper to give a more accurate definition of delicacy than have hitherto be attempt and not to draw our philosophy from too profound a source we shall have recourse to a note story in don quixote it be with good reason say sancho to the squire with the great nose that pretend to have a judgment in wine this be a quality hereditary in our family two of my kinsmen be once call to give their opinion of a hogshead which be suppose to be excellent be old and of a good vintage one of them taste it consider it and after mature reflection pronounce the wine to be good be it not for a small taste of leather which he perceive in it the other after use the same precautions give also his verdict in favour of the wine but with the reserve of a taste of iron which he could easily distinguish you can not imagine how much they be both ridicule for their judgment but who laugh in the end on empty the hogshead there be find at the bottom an old key with a leathern thong tie to it the great resemblance between mental and bodily taste will easily teach us to apply this story though it be certain that beauty and deformity more than sweet and bitter be not qualities in object but belong entirely to the sentiment internal or external it must be allow that there be certain qualities in object which be fit by nature to produce those particular feel now as these qualities may be find in a small degree or may be mix and confound with each other it often happen that the taste be not affect with such minute qualities or be not able to distinguish all the particular flavour amidst the disorder in which they be present where the organs be so fine as to allow nothing to escape them and at the same time so exact as to perceive every ingredient in the composition this we call delicacy of taste whether we employ these term in the literal or metaphorical sense here then the general rule of beauty be of use be draw from establish model and from the observation of what please or displease when present singly and in a high degree and if the same qualities in a continue composition and in a smaller degree affect not the organs with a sensible delight or uneasiness we exclude the person from all pretensions to this delicacy to produce these general rule or avow pattern of composition be like find the key with the leathern thong which justify the verdict of sanchos kinsmen and confound those pretend judge who have condemn them though the hogshead have never be empty the taste of the one be still equally delicate and that of the other equally dull and languid but it would have be more difficult to have prove the superiority of the former to the conviction of every bystander in like manner though the beauties of write have never be methodized or reduce to general principles though no excellent model have ever be acknowledge the different degrees of taste would still have subsist and the judgment of one man be preferable to that of another but it would not have be so easy to silence the bad critic who might always insist upon his particular sentiment and refuse to submit to his antagonist but when we show him an avow principle of art when we illustrate this principle by examples whose operation from his own particular taste he acknowledge to be conformable to the principle when we prove that the same principle may be apply to the present case where he do not perceive or feel its influence he must conclude upon the whole that the fault lie in himself and that he want the delicacy which be requisite to make him sensible of every beauty and every blemish in any composition or discourse it be acknowledge to be the perfection of every sense or faculty to perceive with exactness its most minute object and allow nothing to escape its notice and observation the smaller the object be which become sensible to the eye the finer be that organ and the more elaborate its make and composition a good palate be not try by strong flavour but by a mixture of small ingredients where we be still sensible of each part notwithstanding its minuteness and its confusion with the rest in like manner a quick and acute perception of beauty and deformity must be the perfection of our mental taste nor can a man be satisfy with himself while he suspect that any excellence or blemish in a discourse have pass him unobserved in this case the perfection of the man and the perfection of the sense or feel be find to be unite a very delicate palate on many occasion may be a great inconvenience both to a man himself and to his friends but a delicate taste of wit or beauty must always be a desirable quality because it be the source of all the finest and most innocent enjoyments of which human nature be susceptible in this decision the sentiments of all mankind be agree wherever you can ascertain a delicacy of taste it be sure to meet with approbation and the best way of ascertain it be to appeal to those model and principles which have be establish by the uniform consent and experience of nations and age but though there be naturally a wide difference in point of delicacy between one person and another nothing tend further to encrease and improve this talent than practice in a particular art and the frequent survey or contemplation of a particular species of beauty when object of any kind be first present to the eye or imagination the sentiment which attend them be obscure and confuse and the mind be in a great measure incapable of pronounce concern their merit or defect the taste can not perceive the several excellencies of the performance much less distinguish the particular character of each excellency and ascertain its quality and degree if it pronounce the whole in general to be beautiful or deform it be the utmost that can be expect and even this judgment a person so unpractised will be apt to deliver with great hesitation and reserve but allow him to acquire experience in those object his feel become more exact and nice he not only perceive the beauties and defect of each part but mark the distinguish species of each quality and assign it suitable praise or blame a clear and distinct sentiment attend him through the whole survey of the object and he discern that very degree and kind of approbation or displeasure which each part be naturally fit to produce the mist dissipate which seem formerly to hang over the object the organ acquire greater perfection in its operations and can pronounce without danger of mistake concern the merit of every performance in a word the same address and dexterity which practice give to the execution of any work be also acquire by the same mean in the judge of it so advantageous be practice to the discernment of beauty that before we can give judgment on any work of importance it will even be requisite that that very individual performance be more than once peruse by us and be survey in different light with attention and deliberation there be a flutter or hurry of think which attend the first perusal of any piece and which confound the genuine sentiment of beauty the relation of the part be not discern the true character of style be little distinguish the several perfections and defect seem wrap up in a species of confusion and present themselves indistinctly to the imagination not to mention that there be a species of beauty which as it be florid and superficial please at first but be find incompatible with a just expression either of reason or passion soon pall upon the taste and be then reject with disdain at least rat at a much lower value it be impossible to continue in the practice of contemplate any order of beauty without be frequently oblige to form comparisons between the several species and degrees of excellence and estimate their proportion to each other a man who have have no opportunity of compare the different kinds of beauty be indeed totally unqualified to pronounce an opinion with regard to any object present to him by comparison alone we fix the epithets of praise or blame and learn how to assign the due degree of each the coarsest daub contain a certain lustre of colour and exactness of imitation which be so far beauties and would affect the mind of a peasant or indian with the highest admiration the most vulgar ballads be not entirely destitute of harmony or nature and none but a person familiarize to superior beauties would pronounce their number harsh or narration uninteresting a great inferiority of beauty give pain to a person conversant in the highest excellence of the kind and be for that reason pronounce a deformity as the most finish object with which we be acquaint be naturally suppose to have reach the pinnacle of perfection and to be entitle to the highest applause one accustom to see and examine and weigh the several performances admire in different age and nations can alone rate the merit of a work exhibit to his view and assign its proper rank among the productions of genius but to enable a critic the more fully to execute this undertake he must preserve his mind free from all prejudice and allow nothing to enter into his consideration but the very object which be submit to his examination we may observe that every work of art in order to produce its due effect on the mind must be survey in a certain point of view and can not be fully relish by persons whose situation real or imaginary be not conformable to that which be require by the performance an orator address himself to a particular audience and must have a regard to their particular genius interest opinions passions and prejudice otherwise he hop in vain to govern their resolutions and inflame their affections should they even have entertain some prepossessions against him however unreasonable he must not overlook this disadvantage but before he enter upon the subject must endeavour to conciliate their affection and acquire their good grace a critic of a different age or nation who should peruse this discourse must have all these circumstances in his eye and must place himself in the same situation as the audience in order to form a true judgment of the oration in like manner when any work be address to the public though should have a friendship or enmity with the author must depart from this situation and consider myself as a man in general forget if possible my individual be and my peculiar circumstances a person influence by prejudice comply not with this condition but obstinately maintain his natural position without place himself in that point of view which the performance suppose if the work be address to persons of a different age or nation he make no allowance for their peculiar view and prejudice but full of the manners of his own age and country rashly condemn what seem admirable in the eye of those for whom alone the discourse be calculate if the work be execute for the public he never sufficiently enlarge his comprehension or forget his interest as a friend or enemy as a rival or commentator by this mean his sentiments be pervert nor have the same beauties and blemish the same influence upon him as if he have impose a proper violence on his imagination and have forget himself for a moment so far his taste evidently depart from the true standard and of consequence lose all credit and authority it be well know that in all question submit to the understand prejudice be destructive of sound judgment and pervert all operations of the intellectual faculties it be no less contrary to good taste nor have it less influence to corrupt our sentiment of beauty it belong to good sense to check its influence in both case and in this respect as well as in many others reason if not an essential part of taste be at least requisite to the operations of this latter faculty in all the nobler productions of genius there be a mutual relation and correspondence of part nor can either the beauties or blemish be perceive by him whose think be not capacious enough to comprehend all those part and compare them with each other in order to perceive the consistence and uniformity of the whole every work of art have also a certain end or purpose for which it be calculate and be to be deem more or less perfect as it be more or less fit to attain this end the object of eloquence be to persuade of history to instruct of poetry to please by mean of the passions and the imagination these end we must carry constantly in our view when we peruse any performance and we must be able to judge how far the mean employ be adapt to their respective purpose besides every kind of composition even the most poetical be nothing but a chain of proposition and reason not always indeed the justest and most exact but still plausible and specious however disguise by the colour of the imagination the persons introduce in tragedy and epic poetry must be represent as reason and think and conclude and act suitably to their character and circumstances and without judgment as well as taste and invention a poet can never hope to succeed in so delicate an undertake not to mention that the same excellence of faculties which contribute to the improvement of reason the same clearness of conception the same exactness of distinction the same vivacity of apprehension be essential to the operations of true taste and be its infallible concomitants it seldom or never happen that a man of sense who have experience in any art can not judge of its beauty and it be no less rare to meet with a man who have a just taste without a sound understand thus though the principles of taste be universal and nearly if not entirely the same in all men yet few be qualify to give judgment on any work of art or establish their own sentiment as the standard of beauty the organs of internal sensation be seldom so perfect as to allow the general principles their full play and produce a feel correspondent to those principles they either labour under some defect or be vitiate by some disorder and by that mean excite a sentiment which may be pronounce erroneous when the critic have no delicacy he judge without any distinction and be only affect by the grosser and more palpable qualities of the object the finer touch pass unnoticed and disregard where he be not aid by practice his verdict be attend with confusion and hesitation where no comparison have be employ the most frivolous beauties such as rather merit the name of defect be the object of his admiration where he lie under the influence of prejudice all his natural sentiments be pervert where good sense be want he be not qualify to discern the beauties of design and reason which be the highest and most excellent under some or other of these imperfections the generality of men labour and hence a true judge in the finer arts be observe even during the most polish age to be so rare a character strong sense unite to delicate sentiment improve by practice perfect by comparison and clear of all prejudice can alone entitle critics to this valuable character and the joint verdict of such wherever they be to be find be the true standard of taste and beauty but where be such critics to be find by what mark be they to be know how distinguish them from pretenders these question be embarrass and seem to throw us back into the same uncertainty from which during the course of this essay we have endeavour to extricate ourselves but if we consider the matter aright these be question of fact not of sentiment whether any particular person be endow with good sense and a delicate imagination free from prejudice may often be the subject of dispute and be liable to great discussion and enquiry but that such a character be valuable and estimable will be agree in by all mankind where these doubt occur men can do no more than in other disputable question which be submit to the understand they must produce the best arguments that their invention suggest to them they must acknowledge a true and decisive standard to exist somewhere to wit real existence and matter of fact and they must have indulgence to such as differ from them in their appeal to this standard it be sufficient for our present purpose if we have prove that the taste of all individuals be not upon an equal foot and that some men in general however difficult to be particularly pitch upon will be acknowledge by universal sentiment to have a preference above others but in reality the difficulty of find even in particulars the standard of taste be not so great as it be represent though in speculation we may readily avow a certain criterion in science and deny it in sentiment the matter be find in practice to be much more hard to ascertain in the former case than in the latter theories of abstract philosophy systems of profound theology have prevail during one age in a successive period these have be universally explode their absurdity have be detect other theories and systems have supply their place which again give place to their successors and nothing have be experience more liable to the revolutions of chance and fashion than these pretend decisions of science the case be not the same with the beauties of eloquence and poetry just expressions of passion and nature be sure after a little time to gain public applause which they maintain for ever aristotle and plato and epicurus and descartes may successively yield to each other but terence and virgil maintain an universal undisputed empire over the mind of men the abstract philosophy of cicero have lose its credit the vehemence of his oratory be still the object of our admiration though men of delicate taste be rare they be easily to be distinguish in society by the soundness of their understand and the superiority of their faculties above the rest of mankind the ascendant which they acquire give a prevalence to that lively approbation with which they receive any productions of genius and render it generally predominant many men when leave to themselves have but a faint and dubious perception of beauty who yet be capable of relish any fine stroke which be point out to them every convert to the admiration of the real poet or orator be the cause of some new conversion and though prejudice may prevail for a time they never unite in celebrate any rival to the true genius but yield at last to the force of nature and just sentiment thus though a civilize nation may easily be mistake in the choice of their admire philosopher they never have be find long to err in their affection for a favourite epic or tragic author but notwithstanding all our endeavour to fix a standard of taste and reconcile the discordant apprehensions of men there still remain two source of variation which be not sufficient indeed to confound all the boundaries of beauty and deformity but will often serve to produce a difference in the degrees of our approbation or blame the one be the different humour of particular men the other the particular manners and opinions of our age and country the general principles of taste be uniform in human nature where men vary in their judgments some defect or perversion in the faculties may commonly be remark proceed either from prejudice from want of practice or want of delicacy and there be just reason for approve one taste and condemn another but where there be such a diversity in the internal frame or external situation as be entirely blameless on both side and leave no room to give one the preference above the other in that case a certain degree of diversity in judgment be unavoidable and we seek in vain for a standard by which we can reconcile the contrary sentiments a young man whose passions be warm will be more sensibly touch with amorous and tender image than a man more advance in years who take pleasure in wise philosophical reflections concern the conduct of life and moderation of the passions at twenty ovid may be the favourite author horace at forty and perhaps tacitus at fifty vainly would we in such case endeavour to enter into the sentiments of others and divest ourselves of those propensities which be natural to us we choose our favourite author as we do our friend from a conformity of humour and disposition mirth or passion sentiment or reflection whichever of these most predominate in our temper it give us a peculiar sympathy with the writer who resemble us one person be more please with the sublime another with the tender a third with raillery one have a strong sensibility to blemish and be extremely studious of correctness another have a more lively feel of beauties and pardon twenty absurdities and defect for one elevate or pathetic stroke the ear of this man be entirely turn towards conciseness and energy that man be delight with a copious rich and harmonious expression simplicity be affect by one ornament by another comedy tragedy satire odes have each its partizans who prefer that particular species of write to all others it be plainly an error in a critic to confine his approbation to one species or style of write and condemn all the rest but it be almost impossible not to feel a predilection for that which suit our particular turn and disposition such preferences be innocent and unavoidable and can never reasonably be the object of dispute because there be no standard by which they can be decide for a like reason we be more please in the course of our read with picture and character that resemble object which be find in our own age or country than with those which describe a different set of customs it be not without some effort that we reconcile ourselves to the simplicity of ancient manners and behold princesses carry water from the spring and kings and heroes dress their own victual we may allow in general that the representation of such manners be no fault in the author nor deformity in the piece but we be not so sensibly touch with them for this reason comedy be not easily transfer from one age or nation to another a frenchman or englishman be not please with the andria of terence or clitia of machiavel where the fine lady upon whom all the play turn never once appear to the spectators but be always keep behind the scenes suitably to the reserve humour of the ancient greeks and modern italians a man of learn and reflection can make allowance for these peculiarities of manners but a common audience can never divest themselves so far of their usual ideas and sentiments as to relish picture which no wise resemble them but here there occur a reflection which may perhaps be useful in examine the celebrate controversy concern ancient and modern learn where we often find the one side excuse any seem absurdity in the ancients from the manners of the age and the other refuse to admit this excuse or at least admit it only as an apology for the author not for the performance in my opinion the proper boundaries in this subject have seldom be fix between the contend party where any innocent peculiarities of manners be represent such as those above mention they ought certainly to be admit and a man who be shock with them give an evident proof of false delicacy and refinement the poets monument more durable than brass must fall to the grind like common brick or clay be men to make no allowance for the continual revolutions of manners and customs and would admit of nothing but what be suitable to the prevail fashion must we throw aside the picture of our ancestors because of their ruff and fardingales but where the ideas of morality and decency alter from one age to another and where vicious manners be describe without be mark with the proper character of blame and disapprobation this must be allow to disfigure the poem and to be a real deformity can not nor be it proper should enter into such sentiments and however may excuse the poet on account of the manners of his age never can relish the composition the want of humanity and of decency so conspicuous in the character draw by several of the ancient poets even sometimes by homer and the greek tragedians diminish considerably the merit of their noble performances and give modern author an advantage over them we be not interest in the fortunes and sentiments of such rough heroes we be displease to find the limit of vice and virtue so much confound and whatever indulgence we may give to the writer on account of his prejudice we can not prevail on ourselves to enter into his sentiments or bear an affection to character which we plainly discover to be blameable the case be not the same with moral principles as with speculative opinions of any kind these be in continual flux and revolution the son embrace a different system from the father nay there scarcely be any man who can boast of great constancy and uniformity in this particular whatever speculative errors may be find in the polite write of any age or country they detract but little from the value of those compositions there need but a certain turn of think or imagination to make us enter into all the opinions which then prevail and relish the sentiments or conclusions derive from them but a very violent effort be requisite to change our judgment of manners and excite sentiments of approbation or blame love or hatred different from those to which the mind from long custom have be familiarize and where a man be confident of the rectitude of that moral standard by which he judge he be justly jealous of it and will not pervert the sentiments of his heart for a moment in complaisance to any writer whatsoever of all speculative errors those which regard religion be the most excusable in compositions of genius nor be it ever permit to judge of the civility or wisdom of any people or even of single persons by the grossness or refinement of their theological principles the same good sense that direct men in the ordinary occurrences of life be not hearken to in religious matter which be suppose to be place altogether above the cognizance of human reason on this account all the absurdities of the pagan system of theology must be overlook by every critic who would pretend to form a just notion of ancient poetry and our posterity in their turn must have the same indulgence to their forefathers no religious principles can ever be impute as a fault to any poet while they remain merely principles and take not such strong possession of his heart as to lay him under the imputation of bigotry or superstition where that happen they confound the sentiments of morality and alter the natural boundaries of vice and virtue they be therefore eternal blemish accord to the principle abovementioned nor be the prejudice and false opinions of the age sufficient to justify them it be essential to the roman catholic religion to inspire a violent hatred of every other worship and to represent all pagans mahometans and heretics as the object of divine wrath and vengeance such sentiments though they be in reality very blameable be consider as virtues by the zealots of that communion and be represent in their tragedies and epic poems as a kind of divine heroism this bigotry have disfigure two very fine tragedies of the french theatre polieucte and athalia where an intemperate zeal for particular modes of worship be set off with all the pomp imaginable and form the predominant character of the heroes what be this say the sublime joad to josabet find her in discourse with mathan the priest of baal do the daughter of david speak to this traitor be you not afraid lest the earth should open and pour forth flame to devour you both or lest these holy wall should fall and crush you together what be his purpose why come that enemy of god hither to poison the air which we breathe with his horrid presence such sentiments be receive with great applause on the theatre of paris but at london the spectators would be full as much please to hear achilles tell agamemnon that he be a dog in his forehead and a deer in his heart or jupiter threaten juno with a sound drub if she will not be quiet religious principles be also a blemish in any polite composition when they rise up to superstition and intrude themselves into every sentiment however remote from any connection with religion it be no excuse for the poet that the customs of his country have burthen life with so many religious ceremonies and observances that no part of it be exempt from that yoke it must for ever be ridiculous in petrarch to compare his mistress laura to jesus christ nor be it less ridiculous in that agreeable libertine boccace very seriously to give thank to god almighty and the ladies for their assistance in defend him against his enemies essay moral political and literary part part essay moral political and literary essay of commerce the greater part of mankind may be divide into two class that of shallow thinkers who fall short of the truth and that of abstruse thinkers who go beyond it the latter class be by far the most rare and may add by far the most useful and valuable they suggest hint at least and start difficulties which they want perhaps skill to pursue but which may produce fine discoveries when handle by men who have a more just way of think at worst what they say be uncommon and if it should cost some pain to comprehend it one have however the pleasure of hear something that be new an author be little to be value who tell us nothing but what we can learn from every coffeehouse conversation all people of shallow think be apt to decry even those of solid understand as abstruse thinkers and metaphysicians and refiners and never will allow any thing to be just which be beyond their own weak conceptions there be some case own where an extraordinary refinement afford a strong presumption of falsehood and where no reason be to be trust but what be natural and easy when a man deliberate concern his conduct in any particular affair and form scheme in politics trade œconomy or any business in life he never ought to draw his arguments too fine or connect too long a chain of consequences together something be sure to happen that will disconcert his reason and produce an event different from what he expect but when we reason upon general subject one may justly affirm that our speculations can scarcely ever be too fine provide they be just and that the difference between a common man and a man of genius be chiefly see in the shallowness or depth of the principles upon which they proceed general reason seem intricate merely because they be general nor be it easy for the bulk of mankind to distinguish in a great number of particulars that common circumstance in which they all agree or to extract it pure and unmixed from the other superfluous circumstances every judgment or conclusion with them be particular they can not enlarge their view to those universal proposition which comprehend under them an infinite number of individuals and include a whole science in a single theorem their eye be confound with such an extensive prospect and the conclusions derive from it even though clearly express seem intricate and obscure but however intricate they may seem it be certain that general principles if just and sound must always prevail in the general course of things though they may fail in particular case and it be the chief business of philosophers to regard the general course of things may add that it be also the chief business of politicians especially in the domestic government of the state where the public good which be or ought to be their object depend on the concurrence of a multitude of cause not as in foreign politics on accidents and chance and the caprices of a few persons this therefore make the difference between particular deliberations and general reason and render subtilty and refinement much more suitable to the latter than to the former think this introduction necessary before the follow discourse on commerce money interest balance of trade ca where perhaps there will occur some principles which be uncommon and which may seem too refine and subtile for such vulgar subject if false let them be reject but no one ought to entertain a prejudice against them merely because they be out of the common road the greatness of a state and the happiness of its subject how independent soever they may be suppose in some respect be commonly allow to be inseparable with regard to commerce and as private men receive greater security in the possession of their trade and riches from the power of the public so the public become powerful in proportion to the opulence and extensive commerce of private men this maxim be true in general though can not forbear think that it may possibly admit of exceptions and that we often establish it with too little reserve and limitation there may be some circumstances where the commerce and riches and luxury of individuals instead of add strength to the public will serve only to thin its armies and diminish its authority among the neighbour nations man be a very variable be and susceptible of many different opinions principles and rule of conduct what may be true while he adhere to one way of think will be find false when he have embrace an opposite set of manners and opinions the bulk of every state may be divide into husbandmen and manufacturers the former be employ in the culture of the land the latter work up the materials furnish by the former into all the commodities which be necessary or ornamental to human life as soon as men quit their savage state where they live chiefly by hunt and fish they must fall into these two class though the arts of agriculture employ at first the most numerous part of the society time and experience improve so much these arts that the land may easily maintain a much greater number of men than those who be immediately employ in its culture or who furnish the more necessary manufacture to such as be so employ if these superfluous hand apply themselves to the finer arts which be commonly denominate the arts of luxury they add to the happiness of the state since they afford to many the opportunity of receive enjoyments with which they would otherwise have be unacquainted but may not another scheme be propose for the employment of these superfluous hand may not the sovereign lay claim to them and employ them in fleet and armies to encrease the dominions of the state abroad and spread its fame over distant nations it be certain that the fewer desire and want be find in the proprietors and labourers of land the fewer hand do they employ and consequently the superfluities of the land instead of maintain tradesmen and manufacturers may support fleet and armies to a much greater extent than where a great many arts be require to minister to the luxury of particular persons here therefore seem to be a kind of opposition between the greatness of the state and the happiness of the subject a state be never greater than when all its superfluous hand be employ in the service of the public the ease and convenience of private persons require that these hand should be employ in their service the one can never be satisfy but at the expence of the other as the ambition of the sovereign must entrench on the luxury of individuals so the luxury of individuals must diminish the force and check the ambition of the sovereign nor be this reason merely chimerical but be found on history and experience the republic of sparta be certainly more powerful than any state now in the world consist of an equal number of people and this be owe entirely to the want of commerce and luxury the helotes be the labourers the spartans be the soldier or gentlemen it be evident that the labour of the helotes could not have maintain so great a number of spartans have these latter live in ease and delicacy and give employment to a great variety of trade and manufacture the like policy may be remark in rome and indeed throughout all ancient history it be observable that the smallest republics raise and maintain greater armies than state consist of triple the number of inhabitants be able to support at present it be compute that in all european nations the proportion between soldier and people do not exceed one to a hundred but we read that the city of rome alone with its small territory raise and maintain in early time ten legions against the latinsathens the whole of whose dominions be not larger than yorkshire send to the expedition against sicily near forty thousand mendionysius the elder it be say maintain a stand army of a hundred thousand foot and ten thousand horse besides a large fleet of four hundred sail though his territories extend no farther than the city of syracuse about a third of the island of sicily and some seaport towns and garrison on the coast of italy and illyricum it be true the ancient armies in time of war subsist much upon plunder but do not the enemy plunder in their turn which be a more ruinous way of levy a tax than any other that could be devise in short no probable reason can be assign for the great power of the more ancient state above the modern but their want of commerce and luxury few artizans be maintain by the labour of the farmers and therefore more soldier might live upon it livy say that rome in his time would find it difficult to raise as large an army as that which in her early days she send out against the gauls and latins instead of those soldier who fight for liberty and empire in camilluss time there be in augustuss days musicians painters cook players and tailor and if the land be equally cultivate at both periods it could certainly maintain equal number in the one profession as in the other they add nothing to the mere necessaries of life in the latter period more than in the former it be natural on this occasion to ask whether sovereigns may not return to the maxims of ancient policy and consult their own interest in this respect more than the happiness of their subject answer that it appear to me almost impossible and that because ancient policy be violent and contrary to the more natural and usual course of things it be well know with what peculiar laws sparta be govern and what a prodigy that republic be justly esteem by every one who have consider human nature as it have display itself in other nations and other age be the testimony of history less positive and circumstantial such a government would appear a mere philosophical whim or fiction and impossible ever to be reduce to practice and though the roman and other ancient republics be support on principles somewhat more natural yet be there an extraordinary concurrence of circumstances to make them submit to such grievous burthen they be free state they be small ones and the age be martial all their neighbour be continually in arm freedom naturally beget public spirit especially in small state and this public spirit this amor patriæ must encrease when the public be almost in continual alarm and men be oblige every moment to expose themselves to the greatest dangers for its defence a continual succession of war make every citizen a soldier he take the field in his turn and during his service he be chiefly maintain by himself this service be indeed equivalent to a heavy tax yet be it less felt by a people addict to arm who fight for honour and revenge more than pay and be unacquainted with gain and industry as well as pleasure not to mention the great equality of fortunes among the inhabitants of the ancient republics where every field belong to a different proprietor be able to maintain a family and render the number of citizens very considerable even without trade and manufacture but though the want of trade and manufacture among a free and very martial people may sometimes have no other effect than to render the public more powerful it be certain that in the common course of human affairs it will have a quite contrary tendency sovereigns must take mankind as they find them and can not pretend to introduce any violent change in their principles and ways of think a long course of time with a variety of accidents and circumstances be requisite to produce those great revolutions which so much diversify the face of human affairs and the less natural any set of principles be which support a particular society the more difficulty will a legislator meet with in raise and cultivate them it be his best policy to comply with the common bend of mankind and give it all the improvements of which it be susceptible now accord to the most natural course of things industry and arts and trade encrease the power of the sovereign as well as the happiness of the subject and that policy be violent which aggrandize the public by the poverty of individuals this will easily appear from a few considerations which will present to us the consequences of sloth and barbarity where manufacture and mechanic arts be not cultivate the bulk of the people must apply themselves to agriculture and if their skill and industry encrease there must arise a great superfluity from their labour beyond what suffice to maintain them they have no temptation therefore to encrease their skill and industry since they can not exchange that superfluity for any commodities which may serve either to their pleasure or vanity a habit of indolence naturally prevail the greater part of the land lie uncultivated what be cultivate yield not its utmost for want of skill and assiduity in the farmers if at any time the public exigencies require that great number should be employ in the public service the labour of the people furnish now no superfluities by which these number can be maintain the labourers can not encrease their skill and industry on a sudden land uncultivated can not be bring into tillage for some years the armies mean while must either make sudden and violent conquests or disband for want of subsistence a regular attack or defence therefore be not to be expect from such a people and their soldier must be as ignorant and unskilful as their farmers and manufacturers every thing in the world be purchase by labour and our passions be the only cause of labour when a nation abound in manufacture and mechanic arts the proprietors of land as well as the farmers study agriculture as a science and redouble their industry and attention the superfluity which arise from their labour be not lose but be exchange with manufacture for those commodities which mens luxury now make them covet by this mean land furnish a great deal more of the necessaries of life than what suffice for those who cultivate it in time of peace and tranquillity this superfluity go to the maintenance of manufacturers and the improvers of liberal arts but it be easy for the public to convert many of these manufacturers into soldier and maintain them by that superfluity which arise from the labour of the farmers accordingly we find that this be the case in all civilize governments when the sovereign raise an army what be the consequence he impose a tax this tax oblige all the people to retrench what be least necessary to their subsistence those who labour in such commodities must either enlist in the troop or turn themselves to agriculture and thereby oblige some labourers to enlist for want of business and to consider the matter abstractedly manufacture encrease the power of the state only as they store up so much labour and that of a kind to which the public may lay claim without deprive any one of the necessaries of life the more labour therefore be employ beyond mere necessaries the more powerful be any state since the persons engage in that labour may easily be convert to the public service in a state without manufacture there may be the same number of hand but there be not the same quantity of labour nor of the same kind all the labour be there bestow upon necessaries which can admit of little or no abatement thus the greatness of the sovereign and the happiness of the state be in a great measure unite with regard to trade and manufacture it be a violent method and in most case impracticable to oblige the labourer to toil in order to raise from the land more than what subsist himself and family furnish him with manufacture and commodities and he will do it of himself afterwards you will find it easy to seize some part of his superfluous labour and employ it in the public service without give him his wonted return be accustom to industry he will think this less grievous than if at once you oblige him to an augmentation of labour without any reward the case be the same with regard to the other members of the state the greater be the stock of labour of all kinds the greater quantity may be take from the heap without make any sensible alteration in it a public granary of corn a storehouse of cloth a magazine of arm all these must be allow real riches and strength in any state trade and industry be really nothing but a stock of labour which in time of peace and tranquillity be employ for the ease and satisfaction of individuals but in the exigencies of state may in part be turn to public advantage could we convert a city into a kind of fortify camp and infuse into each breast so martial a genius and such a passion for public good as to make every one will to undergo the greatest hardships for the sake of the public these affections might now as in ancient time prove alone a sufficient spur to industry and support the community it would then be advantageous as in camp to banish all arts and luxury and by restrictions on equipage and table make the provision and forage last longer than if the army be load with a number of superfluous retainers but as these principles be too disinterested and too difficult to support it be requisite to govern men by other passions and animate them with a spirit of avarice and industry art and luxury the camp be in this case load with a superfluous retinue but the provision flow in proportionably larger the harmony of the whole be still support and the natural bend of the mind be more comply with individuals as well as the public find their account in the observance of those maxims the same method of reason will let us see the advantage of foreign commerce in augment the power of the state as well as the riches and happiness of the subject it encreases the stock of labour in the nation and the sovereign may convert what share of it he find necessary to the service of the public foreign trade by its import furnish materials for new manufacture and by its export it produce labour in particular commodities which could not be consume at home in short a kingdom that have a large import and export must abound more with industry and that employ upon delicacies and luxuries than a kingdom which rest content with its native commodities it be therefore more powerful as well as richer and happier the individuals reap the benefit of these commodities so far as they gratify the sense and appetites and the public be also a gainer while a greater stock of labour be by this mean store up against any public exigency that be a greater number of laborious men be maintain who may be divert to the public service without rob any one of the necessaries or even the chief conveniencies of life if we consult history we shall find that in most nations foreign trade have precede any refinement in home manufacture and give birth to domestic luxury the temptation be stronger to make use of foreign commodities which be ready for use and which be entirely new to us than to make improvements on any domestic commodity which always advance by slow degrees and never affect us by their novelty the profit be also very great in export what be superfluous at home and what bear no price to foreign nations whose soil or climate be not favourable to that commodity thus men become acquaint with the pleasures of luxury and the profit of commerce and their delicacy and industry be once awaken carry them on to farther improvements in every branch of domestic as well as foreign trade and this perhaps be the chief advantage which arise from a commerce with strangers it rouse men from their indolence and present the gayer and more opulent part of the nation with object of luxury which they never before dream of raise in them a desire of a more splendid way of life than what their ancestors enjoy and at the same time the few merchants who possess the secret of this importation and exportation make great profit and become rival in wealth to the ancient nobility tempt other adventurers to become their rival in commerce imitation soon diffuse all those arts while domestic manufacture emulate the foreign in their improvements and work up every home commodity to the utmost perfection of which it be susceptible their own steel and iron in such laborious hand become equal to the gold and rubies of the indies when the affairs of the society be once bring to this situation a nation may lose most of its foreign trade and yet continue a great and powerful people if strangers will not take any particular commodity of ours we must cease to labour in it the same hand will turn themselves towards some refinement in other commodities which may be want at home and there must always be materials for them to work upon till every person in the state who possess riches enjoy as great plenty of home commodities and those in as great perfection as he desire which can never possibly happen china be represent as one of the most flourish empires in the world though it have very little commerce beyond its own territories it will not hope be consider as a superfluous digression if here observe that as the multitude of mechanical arts be advantageous so be the great number of persons to whose share the productions of these arts fall a too great disproportion among the citizens weaken any state every person if possible ought to enjoy the fruit of his labour in a full possession of all the necessaries and many of the conveniencies of life no one can doubt but such an equality be most suitable to human nature and diminish much less from the happiness of the rich than it add to that of the poor it also augment the power of the state and make any extraordinary tax or impositions be pay with more chearfulness where the riches be engross by a few these must contribute very largely to the supply of the public necessities but when the riches be disperse among multitudes the burthen feel light on every shoulder and the tax make not a very sensible difference on any ones way of live add to this that where the riches be in few hand these must enjoy all the power and will readily conspire to lay the whole burthen on the poor and oppress them still farther to the discouragement of all industry in this circumstance consist the great advantage of england above any nation at present in the world or that appear in the record of any story it be true the english feel some disadvantage in foreign trade by the high price of labour which be in part the effect of the riches of their artisans as well as of the plenty of money but as foreign trade be not the most material circumstance it be not to be put in competition with the happiness of so many millions and if there be no more to endear to them that free government under which they live this alone be sufficient the poverty of the common people be a natural if not an infallible effect of absolute monarchy though doubt whether it be always true on the other hand that their riches be an infallible result of liberty liberty must be attend with particular accidents and a certain turn of think in order to produce that effect lord bacon account for the great advantage obtain by the english in their war with france ascribe them chiefly to the superior ease and plenty of the common people amongst the former yet the government of the two kingdoms be at that time pretty much alike where the labourers and artisans be accustom to work for low wag and to retain but a small part of the fruit of their labour it be difficult for them even in a free government to better their condition or conspire among themselves to heighten their wag but even where they be accustom to a more plentiful way of life it be easy for the rich in an arbitrary government to conspire against them and throw the whole burthen of the tax on their shoulder it may seem an odd position that the poverty of the common people in france italy and spain be in some measure owe to the superior riches of the soil and happiness of the climate yet there want not reason to justify this paradox in such a fine mould or soil as that of those more southern regions agriculture be an easy art and one man with a couple of sorry horse will be able in a season to cultivate as much land as will pay a pretty considerable rent to the proprietor all the art which the farmer know be to leave his grind fallow for a year as soon as it be exhaust and the warmth of the sun alone and temperature of the climate enrich it and restore its fertility such poor peasants therefore require only a simple maintenance for their labour they have no stock or riches which claim more and at the same time they be for ever dependant on their landlord who give no lease nor fear that his land will be spoil by the ill methods of cultivation in england the land be rich but coarse must be cultivate at a great expence and produce slender crop when not carefully manage and by a method which give not the full profit but in a course of several years a farmer therefore in england must have a considerable stock and a long lease which beget proportional profit the fine vineyards of champagne and burgundy that often yield to the landlord above five pound per acre be cultivate by peasants who have scarcely bread the reason be that such peasants need no stock but their own limbs with instrument of husbandry which they can buy for twenty shill the farmers be commonly in some better circumstances in those countries but the grasiers be most at their ease of all those who cultivate the land the reason be still the same men must have profit proportionable to their expence and hazard where so considerable a number of the labour poor as the peasants and farmers be in very low circumstances all the rest must partake of their poverty whether the government of that nation be monarchical or republican we may form a similar remark with regard to the general history of mankind what be the reason why no people live between the tropics could ever yet attain to any art or civility or reach even any police in their government and any military discipline while few nations in the temperate climates have be altogether deprive of these advantage it be probable that one cause of this phænomenon be the warmth and equality of weather in the torrid zone which render clothe and house less requisite for the inhabitants and thereby remove in part that necessity which be the great spur to industry and invention curis acuens mortalia corda not to mention that the fewer goods or possessions of this kind any people enjoy the fewer quarrel be likely to arise amongst them and the less necessity will there be for a settle police or regular authority to protect and defend them from foreign enemies or from each other essay of refinement in the artsa luxury be a word of an uncertain signification and may be take in a good as well as in a bad sense in general it mean great refinement in the gratification of the sense and any degree of it may be innocent or blameable accord to the age or country or condition of the person the bound between the virtue and the vice can not here be exactly fix more than in other moral subject to imagine that the gratify of any sense or the indulge of any delicacy in meat drink or apparel be of itself a vice can never enter into a head that be not disorder by the frenzies of enthusiasm have indeed hear of a monk abroad who because the windows of his cell open upon a noble prospect make a covenant with his eye never to turn that way or receive so sensual a gratification and such be the crime of drink champagne or burgundy preferably to small beer or porter these indulgences be only vices when they be pursue at the expence of some virtue as liberality or charity in like manner as they be follies when for them a man ruin his fortune and reduce himself to want and beggary where they entrench upon no virtue but leave ample subject whence to provide for friends family and every proper object of generosity or compassion they be entirely innocent and have in every age be acknowledge such by almost all moralists to be entirely occupy with the luxury of the table for instance without any relish for the pleasures of ambition study or conversation be a mark of stupidity and be incompatible with any vigour of temper or genius to confine ones expence entirely to such a gratification without regard to friends or family be an indication of a heart destitute of humanity or benevolence but if a man reserve time sufficient for all laudable pursuits and money sufficient for all generous purpose he be free from every shadow of blame or reproach since luxury may be consider either as innocent or blameable one may be surprized at those preposterous opinions which have be entertain concern it while men of libertine principles bestow praise even on vicious luxury and represent it as highly advantageous to society and on the other hand men of severe morals blame even the most innocent luxury and represent it as the source of all the corruptions disorder and factions incident to civil government we shall here endeavour to correct both these extremes by prove first that the age of refinement be both the happiest and most virtuous secondly that wherever luxury cease to be innocent it also cease to be beneficial and when carry a degree too far be a quality pernicious though perhaps not the most pernicious to political society to prove the first point we need but consider the effect of refinement both on private and on public life human happiness accord to the most receive notions seem to consist in three ingredients action pleasure and indolence and though these ingredients ought to be mix in different proportion accord to the particular disposition of the person yet no one ingredient can be entirely want without destroy in some measure the relish of the whole composition indolence or repose indeed seem not of itself to contribute much to our enjoyment but like sleep be requisite as an indulgence to the weakness of human nature which can not support an uninterrupted course of business or pleasure that quick march of the spirit which take a man from himself and chiefly give satisfaction do in the end exhaust the mind and require some intervals of repose which though agreeable for a moment yet if prolong beget a languor and lethargy that destroy all enjoyment education custom and example have a mighty influence in turn the mind to any of these pursuits and it must be own that where they promote a relish for action and pleasure they be so far favourable to human happiness in time when industry and the arts flourish men be keep in perpetual occupation and enjoy as their reward the occupation itself as well as those pleasures which be the fruit of their labour the mind acquire new vigour enlarge its power and faculties and by an assiduity in honest industry both satisfy its natural appetites and prevent the growth of unnatural ones which commonly spring up when nourish by ease and idleness banish those arts from society you deprive men both of action and of pleasure and leave nothing but indolence in their place you even destroy the relish of indolence which never be agreeable but when it succeed to labour and recruit the spirit exhaust by too much application and fatigue another advantage of industry and of refinements in the mechanical arts be that they commonly produce some refinements in the liberal nor can one be carry to perfection without be accompany in some degree with the other the same age which produce great philosophers and politicians renowned general and poets usually abound with skilful weavers and shipcarpenters we can not reasonably expect that a piece of woollen cloth will be work to perfection in a nation which be ignorant of astronomy or where ethics be neglect the spirit of the age affect all the arts and the mind of men be once rouse from their lethargy and put into a fermentation turn themselves on all side and carry improvements into every art and science profound ignorance be totally banish and men enjoy the privilege of rational creatures to think as well as to act to cultivate the pleasures of the mind as well as those of the body the more these refine arts advance the more sociable men become nor be it possible that when enrich with science and possess of a fund of conversation they should be content to remain in solitude or live with their fellowcitizens in that distant manner which be peculiar to ignorant and barbarous nations they flock into cities love to receive and communicate knowledge to show their wit or their breed their taste in conversation or live in clothe or furniture curiosity allure the wise vanity the foolish and pleasure both particular club and societies be every where form both sex meet in an easy and sociable manner and the temper of men as well as their behaviour refine apace so that beside the improvements which they receive from knowledge and the liberal arts it be impossible but they must feel an encrease of humanity from the very habit of converse together and contribute to each others pleasure and entertainment thus industry knowledge and humanity be link together by an indissoluble chain and be find from experience as well as reason to be peculiar to the more polish and what be commonly denominate the more luxurious age nor be these advantage attend with disadvantage that bear any proportion to them the more men refine upon pleasure the less will they indulge in excesses of any kind because nothing be more destructive to true pleasure than such excesses one may safely affirm that the tartars be oftener guilty of beastly gluttony when they feast on their dead horse than european courtiers with all their refinements of cookery and if libertine love or even infidelity to the marriagebed be more frequent in polite age when it be often regard only as a piece of gallantry drunkenness on the other hand be much less common a vice more odious and more pernicious both to mind and body and in this matter would appeal not only to an ovid or a petronius but to a seneca or a cato we know that cæsar during catilines conspiracy be necessitate to put into catos hand a billetdoux which discover an intrigue with servilia catos own sister that stern philosopher throw it back to him with indignation and in the bitterness of his wrath give him the appellation of drunkard as a term more opprobrious than that with which he could more justly have reproach him but industry knowledge and humanity be not advantageous in private life alone they diffuse their beneficial influence on the public and render the government as great and flourish as they make individuals happy and prosperous the encrease and consumption of all the commodities which serve to the ornament and pleasure of life be advantageous to society because at the same time that they multiply those innocent gratifications to individuals they be a kind of storehouse of labour which in the exigencies of state may be turn to the public service in a nation where there be no demand for such superfluities men sink into indolence lose all enjoyment of life and be useless to the public which can not maintain or support its fleet and armies from the industry of such slothful members the bound of all the european kingdoms be at present nearly the same they be two hundred years ago but what a difference be there in the power and grandeur of those kingdoms which can be ascribe to nothing but the encrease of art and industry when charles of france invade italy he carry with him about men yet this armament so exhaust the nation as we learn from guicciardin that for some years it be not able to make so great an effort the late king of france in time of war keep in pay above men though from mazarines death to his own he be engage in a course of war that last near thirty years this industry be much promote by the knowledge inseparable from age of art and refinement as on the other hand this knowledge enable the public to make the best advantage of the industry of its subject laws order police discipline these can never be carry to any degree of perfection before human reason have refine itself by exercise and by an application to the more vulgar arts at least of commerce and manufacture can we expect that a government will be well model by a people who know not how to make a spinningwheel or to employ a loom to advantage not to mention that all ignorant age be infest with superstition which throw the government off its bias and disturb men in the pursuit of their interest and happiness knowledge in the arts of government naturally beget mildness and moderation by instruct men in the advantage of humane maxims above rigour and severity which drive subject into rebellion and make the return to submission impracticable by cut off all hop of pardon when the temper of men be soften as well as their knowledge improve this humanity appear still more conspicuous and be the chief characteristic which distinguish a civilize age from time of barbarity and ignorance factions be then less inveterate revolutions less tragical authority less severe and seditions less frequent even foreign war abate of their cruelty and after the field of battle where honour and interest steel men against compassion as well as fear the combatants divest themselves of the brute and resume the man nor need we fear that men by lose their ferocity will lose their martial spirit or become less undaunted and vigorous in defence of their country or their liberty the arts have no such effect in enervate either the mind or body on the contrary industry their inseparable attendant add new force to both and if anger which be say to be the whetstone of courage lose somewhat of its asperity by politeness and refinement a sense of honour which be a stronger more constant and more governable principle acquire fresh vigour by that elevation of genius which arise from knowledge and a good education add to this that courage can neither have any duration nor be of any use when not accompany with discipline and martial skill which be seldom find among a barbarous people the ancients remark that datames be the only barbarian that ever know the art of war and pyrrhus see the romans marshal their army with some art and skill say with surprize these barbarians have nothing barbarous in their discipline it be observable that as the old romans by apply themselves solely to war be almost the only uncivilized people that ever possess military discipline so the modern italians be the only civilize people among europeans that ever want courage and a martial spirit those who would ascribe this effeminacy of the italians to their luxury or politeness or application to the arts need but consider the french and english whose bravery be as uncontestable as their love for the arts and their assiduity in commerce the italian historians give us a more satisfactory reason for this degeneracy of their countrymen they shew us how the sword be drop at once by all the italian sovereigns while the venetian aristocracy be jealous of its subject the florentine democracy apply itself entirely to commerce rome be govern by priests and naples by women war then become the business of soldier of fortune who spar one another and to the astonishment of the world could engage a whole day in what they call a battle and return at night to their camp without the least bloodshed what have chiefly induce severe moralists to declaim against refinement in the arts be the example of ancient rome which join to its poverty and rusticity virtue and public spirit rise to such a surprizing height of grandeur and liberty but have learn from its conquer provinces b the asiatic luxury fell into every kind of corruption whence arise sedition and civil war attend at last with the total loss of liberty all the latin classics whom we peruse in our infancy be full of these sentiments and universally ascribe the ruin of their state to the arts and riches import from the east insomuch that sallust represent a taste for paint as a vice no less than lewdness and drink and so popular be these sentiments during the later age of the republic that this author abound in praise of the old rigid roman virtue though himself the most egregious instance of modern luxury and corruption speak contemptuously of the grecian eloquence though the most elegant writer in the world nay employ preposterous digressions and declamations to this purpose though a model of taste and correctness but it would be easy to prove that these writers mistake the cause of the disorder in the roman state and ascribe to luxury and the arts what really proceed from an ill model government and the unlimited extent of conquests c refinement on the pleasures and conveniencies of life have no natural tendency to beget venality and corruption the value which all men put upon any particular pleasure depend on comparison and experience nor be a porter less greedy of money which he spend on bacon and brandy than a courtier who purchase champagne and ortolans riches be valuable at all time and to all men because they always purchase pleasures such as men be accustom to and desire nor can any thing restrain or regulate the love of money but a sense of honour and virtue which if it be not nearly equal at all time will naturally abound most in age of knowledge and refinement of all european kingdoms poland seem the most defective in the arts of war as well as peace mechanical as well as liberal yet it be there that venality and corruption do most prevail the nobles seem to have preserve their crown elective for no other purpose than regularly to sell it to the highest bidder this be almost the only species of commerce with which that people be acquaint the liberties of england so far from decay since the improvements in the arts have never flourish so much as during that period and though corruption may seem to encrease of late years this be chiefly to be ascribe to our establish liberty when our princes have find the impossibility of govern without parliaments or of terrify parliaments by the phantom of prerogative not to mention that this corruption or venality prevail much more among the electors than the elect and therefore can not justly be ascribe to any refinements in luxury if we consider the matter in a proper light we shall find that a progress in the arts be rather favourable to liberty and have a natural tendency to preserve if not produce a free government in rude unpolished nations where the arts be neglect all labour be bestow on the cultivation of the grind and the whole society be divide into two class proprietors of land and their vassals or tenant the latter be necessarily dependent and fit for slavery and subjection especially where they possess no riches and be not value for their knowledge in agriculture as must always be the case where the arts be neglect the former naturally erect themselves into petty tyrants and must either submit to an absolute master for the sake of peace and order or if they will preserve their independency like the d ancient barons they must fall into feud and contest among themselves and throw the whole society into such confusion as be perhaps worse than the most despotic government but where luxury nourish commerce and industry the peasants by a proper cultivation of the land become rich and independent while the tradesmen and merchants acquire a share of the property and draw authority and consideration to that middle rank of men who be the best and firmest basis of public liberty these submit not to slavery like the peasants from poverty and meanness of spirit and have no hop of tyrannize over others like the barons they be not tempt for the sake of that gratification to submit to the tyranny of their sovereign they covet equal laws which may secure their property and preserve them from monarchical as well as aristocratical tyranny the lower house be the support of our popular government and all the world acknowledge that it owe its chief influence and consideration to the encrease of commerce which throw such a balance of property into the hand of the commons how inconsistent then be it to blame so violently a refinement in the arts and to represent it as the bane of liberty and public spirit to declaim against present time and magnify the virtue of remote ancestors be a propensity almost inherent in human nature and as the sentiments and opinions of civilize age alone be transmit to posterity hence it be that we meet with so many severe judgments pronounce against luxury and even science and hence it be that at present we give so ready an assent to them but the fallacy be easily perceive by compare different nations that be contemporaries where we both judge more impartially and can better set in opposition those manners with which we be sufficiently acquaint treachery and cruelty the most pernicious and most odious of all vices seem peculiar to uncivilized age and by the refine greeks and romans be ascribe to all the barbarous nations which surround them they might justly therefore have presume that their own ancestors so highly celebrate possess no greater virtue and be as much inferior to their posterity in honour and humanity as in taste and science an ancient frank or saxon may be highly extol but believe every man would think his life or fortune much less secure in the hand of a moor or tartar than in those of a french or english gentleman the rank of men the most civilize in the most civilize nations we come now to the second position which we propose to illustrate to wit that as innocent luxury or a refinement in the arts and conveniencies of life be advantageous to the public so wherever luxury cease to be innocent it also cease to be beneficial and when carry a degree farther begin to be a quality pernicious though perhaps not the most pernicious to political society let us consider what we call vicious luxury no gratification however sensual can of itself be esteem vicious a gratification be only vicious when it engross all a man expence and leave no ability for such act of duty and generosity as be require by his situation and fortune suppose that he correct the vice and employ part of his expence in the education of his children in the support of his friends and in relieve the poor would any prejudice result to society on the contrary the same consumption would arise and that labour which at present be employ only in produce a slender gratification to one man would relieve the necessitous and bestow satisfaction on hundreds the same care and toil that raise a dish of peas at christmas would give bread to a whole family during six months to say that without a vicious luxury the labour would not have be employ at all be only to say that there be some other defect in human nature such as indolence selfishness inattention to others for which luxury in some measure provide a remedy as one poison may be an antidote to another but virtue like wholesome food be better than poison however correct suppose the same number of men that be at present in great britain with the same soil and climate ask be it not possible for them to be happier by the most perfect way of life that can be imagine and by the greatest reformation that omnipotence itself could work in their temper and disposition to assert that they can not appear evidently ridiculous as the land be able to maintain more than all its present inhabitants they could never in such a utopian state feel any other ills than those which arise from bodily sickness and these be not the half of human miseries all other ills spring from some vice either in ourselves or others and even many of our diseases proceed from the same origin remove the vices and the ills follow you must only take care to remove all the vices if you remove part you may render the matter worse by banish vicious luxury without cure sloth and an indifference to others you only diminish industry in the state and add nothing to mens charity or their generosity let us therefore rest content with assert that two opposite vices in a state may be more advantageous than either of them alone but let us never pronounce vice in itself advantageous be it not very inconsistent for an author to assert in one page that moral distinctions be inventions of politicians for public interest and in the next page maintain that vice be advantageous to the public and indeed it seem upon any system of morality little less than a contradiction in term to talk of a vice which be in general beneficial to societye think this reason necessary in order to give some light to a philosophical question which have be much dispute in england call it a philosophical question not a political one for whatever may be the consequence of such a miraculous transformation of mankind as would endow them with every species of virtue and free them from every species of vice this concern not the magistrate who aim only at possibilities he can not cure every vice by substitute a virtue in its place very often he can only cure one vice by another and in that case he ought to prefer what be least pernicious to society luxury when excessive be the source of many ills but be in general preferable to sloth and idleness which would commonly succeed in its place and be more hurtful both to private persons and to the public when sloth reign a mean uncultivated way of life prevail amongst individuals without society without enjoyment and if the sovereign in such a situation demand the service of his subject the labour of the state suffice only to furnish the necessaries of life to the labourers and can afford nothing to those who be employ in the public service essay of money money be not properly speak one of the subject of commerce but only the instrument which men have agree upon to facilitate the exchange of one commodity for another it be none of the wheel of trade it be the oil which render the motion of the wheel more smooth and easy if we consider any one kingdom by itself it be evident that the greater or less plenty of money be of no consequence since the price of commodities be always proportion to the plenty of money and a crown in harry viis time serve the same purpose as a pound do at present it be only the public which draw any advantage from the greater plenty of money and that only in its war and negociations with foreign state and this be the reason why all rich and trade countries from carthage to great britain and holland have employ mercenary troop which they hire from their poorer neighbour be they to make use of their native subject they would find less advantage from their superior riches and from their great plenty of gold and silver since the pay of all their servants must rise in proportion to the public opulence our small army of men be maintain at as great expence as a french army a twice as numerous the english fleet during the late war require as much money to support it as all the roman legions which keep the whole world in subjection during the time of the emperors the greater number of people and their greater industry be serviceable in all case at home and abroad in private and in public but the greater plenty of money be very limit in its use and may even sometimes be a loss to a nation in its commerce with foreigners there seem to be a happy concurrence of cause in human affairs which check the growth of trade and riches and hinder them from be confine entirely to one people as might naturally at first be dread from the advantage of an establish commerce where one nation have get the start of another in trade it be very difficult for the latter to regain the grind it have lose because of the superior industry and skill of the former and the greater stock of which its merchants be possess and which enable them to trade on so much smaller profit but these advantage be compensate in some measure by the low price of labour in every nation which have not an extensive commerce and do not much abound in gold and silver manufacture therefore gradually shift their place leave those countries and provinces which they have already enrich and fly to others whither they be allure by the cheapness of provision and labour till they have enrich these also and be again banish by the same cause and in general we may observe that the dearness of every thing from plenty of money be a disadvantage which attend an establish commerce and set bound to it in every country by enable the poorer state to undersel the richer in all foreign market this have make me entertain a doubt concern the benefit of bank and papercredit which be so generally esteem advantageous to every nation that provision and labour should become dear by the encrease of trade and money be in many respect an inconvenience but an inconvenience that be unavoidable and the effect of that public wealth and prosperity which be the end of all our wish it be compensate by the advantage which we reap from the possession of these precious metal and the weight which they give the nation in all foreign war and negociations but there appear no reason for encreasing that inconvenience by a counterfeit money which foreigners will not accept of in any payment and which any great disorder in the state will reduce to nothing there be it be true many people in every rich state who have large sum of money would prefer paper with good security as be of more easy transport and more safe custody if the public provide not a bank private bankers will take advantage of this circumstance as the goldsmiths formerly do in london or as the bankers do at present in dublin and therefore it be better it may be think that a public company should enjoy the benefit of that papercredit which always will have place in every opulent kingdom but to endeavour artificially to encrease such a credit can never be the interest of any trade nation but must lay them under disadvantage by encreasing money beyond its natural proportion to labour and commodities and thereby heighten their price to the merchant and manufacturer and in this view it must be allow that no bank could be more advantageous than such a one as lock up all the money it receive and never augment the circulate coin as be usual by return part of its treasure into commerce a public bank by this expedient might cut off much of the deal of private bankers and moneyjobbers and though the state bore the charge of salaries to the directors and tellers of this bank for accord to the precede supposition it would have no profit from its deal the national advantage result from the low price of labour and the destruction of papercredit would be a sufficient compensation not to mention that so large a sum lie ready at command would be a convenience in time of great public danger and distress and what part of it be use might be replace at leisure when peace and tranquillity be restore to the nation but of this subject of paper credit we shall treat more largely hereafter and shall finish this essay on money by propose and explain two observations which may perhaps serve to employ the thoughts of our speculative politiciansc it be a shrewd observation of anacharsis the scythian who have never see money in his own country that gold and silver seem to him of no use to the greeks but to assist them in numeration and arithmetic it be indeed evident that money be nothing but the representation of labour and commodities and serve only as a method of rat or estimate them where coin be in greater plenty as a greater quantity of it be require to represent the same quantity of goods it can have no effect either good or bad take a nation within itself any more than it would make an alteration on a merchants book if instead of the arabian method of notation which require few character he should make use of the roman which require a great many nay the greater quantity of money like the roman character be rather inconvenient and require greater trouble both to keep and transport it but notwithstanding this conclusion which must be allow just it be certain that since the discovery of the mine in america industry have encreased in all the nations of europe except in the possessors of those mine and this may justly be ascribe amongst other reason to the encrease of gold and silver accordingly we find that in every kingdom into which money begin to flow in greater abundance than formerly every thing take a new face labour and industry gain life the merchant become more enterprising the manufacturer more diligent and skilful and even the farmer follow his plough with greater alacrity and attention this be not easily to be account for if we consider only the influence which a greater abundance of coin have in the kingdom itself by heighten the price of commodities and oblige every one to pay a greater number of these little yellow or white piece for every thing he purchase and as to foreign trade it appear that great plenty of money be rather disadvantageous by raise the price of every kind of labour to account then for this phenomenon we must consider that though the high price of commodities be a necessary consequence of the encrease of gold and silver yet it follow not immediately upon that encrease but some time be require before the money circulate through the whole state and make its effect be felt on all rank of people at first no alteration be perceive by degrees the price rise first of one commodity then of another till the whole at last reach a just proportion with the new quantity of specie which be in the kingdom in my opinion it be only in this interval or intermediate situation between the acquisition of money and rise of price that the encreasing quantity of gold and silver be favourable to industry when any quantity of money be import into a nation it be not at first disperse into many hand but be confine to the coffers of a few persons who immediately seek to employ it to advantage here be a set of manufacturers or merchants we shall suppose who have receive return of gold and silver for goods which they send to cadiz they be thereby enable to employ more workmen than formerly who never dream of demand higher wag but be glad of employment from such good paymasters if workmen become scarce the manufacturer give higher wag but at first require an encrease of labour and this be willingly submit to by the artisan who can now eat and drink better to compensate his additional toil and fatigue he carry his money to market where he find every thing at the same price as formerly but return with greater quantity and of better kinds for the use of his family the farmer and gardener find that all their commodities be take off apply themselves with alacrity to the raise more and at the same time can afford to take better and more cloths from their tradesmen whose price be the same as formerly and their industry only whet by so much new gain it be easy to trace the money in its progress through the whole commonwealth where we shall find that it must first quicken the diligence of every individual before it encrease the price of labour and that the specie may encrease to a considerable pitch before it have this latter effect appear amongst other instance from the frequent operations of the french king on the money where it be always find that the augment of the numerary value do not produce a proportional rise of the price at least for some time in the last year of louis money be raise threesevenths but price augment only one corn in france be now sell at the same price or for the same number of livres it be in though silver be then at livres the mark and be now at not to mention the great addition of gold and silver which may have come into that kingdom since the former period from the whole of this reason we may conclude that it be of no manner of consequence with regard to the domestic happiness of a state whether money be in a greater or less quantity the good policy of the magistrate consist only in keep it if possible still encreasing because by that mean he keep alive a spirit of industry in the nation and encreases the stock of labour in which consist all real power and riches a nation whose money decrease be actually at that time weaker and more miserable than another nation which possess no more money but be on the encreasing hand this will be easily account for if we consider that the alterations in the quantity of money either on one side or the other be not immediately attend with proportionable alterations in the price of commodities there be always an interval before matter be adjust to their new situation and this interval be as pernicious to industry when gold and silver be diminish as it be advantageous when these metal be encreasing the workman have not the same employment from the manufacturer and merchant though he pay the same price for every thing in the market the farmer can not dispose of his corn and cattle though he must pay the same rent to his landlord the poverty and beggary and sloth which must ensue be easily foresee the second observation which propose to make with regard to money may be explain after the follow manner there be some kingdoms and many provinces in europe and all of them be once in the same condition where money be so scarce that the landlord can get none at all from his tenant but be oblige to take his rent in kind and either to consume it himself or transport it to place where he may find a market in those countries the prince can levy few or no tax but in the same manner and as he will receive small benefit from impositions so pay it be evident that such a kingdom have little force even at home and can not maintain fleet and armies to the same extent as if every part of it abound in gold and silver there be surely a greater disproportion between the force of germany at present and what it be three centuries ago than there be in its industry people and manufacture the austrian dominions in the empire be in general well people and well cultivate and be of great extent but have not a proportionable weight in the balance of europe proceed as be commonly suppose from the scarcity of money how do all these facts agree with that principle of reason that the quantity of gold and silver be in itself altogether indifferent accord to that principle wherever a sovereign have number of subject and these have plenty of commodities he should of course be great and powerful and they rich and happy independent of the greater or lesser abundance of the precious metal these admit of divisions and subdivisions to a great extent and where the piece might become so small as to be in danger of be lose it be easy to mix the gold or silver with a baser metal as be practise in some countries of europe and by that mean raise the piece to a bulk more sensible and convenient they still serve the same purpose of exchange whatever their number may be or whatever colour they may be suppose to have to these difficulties answer that the effect here suppose to flow from scarcity of money really arise from the manners and customs of the people and that we mistake as be too usual a collateral effect for a cause the contradiction be only apparent but it require some think and reflection to discover the principles by which we can reconcile reason to experience it seem a maxim almost selfevident that the price of every thing depend on the proportion between commodities and money and that any considerable alteration on either have the same effect either of heighten or lower the price encrease the commodities they become cheaper encrease the money they rise in their value as on the other hand a diminution of the former and that of the latter have contrary tendencies it be also evident that the price do not so much depend on the absolute quantity of commodities and that of money which be in a nation as on that of the commodities which come or may come to market and of the money which circulate if the coin be lock up in chests it be the same thing with regard to price as if it be annihilate if the commodities be hoard in e magazines and granaries a like effect follow as the money and commodities in these case never meet they can not affect each other be we at any time to form conjecture concern the price of provision the corn which the farmer must reserve f for seed and for the maintenance of himself and family ought never to enter into the estimation it be only the overplus compare to the demand that determine the value to apply these principles we must consider that in the first and more uncultivated age of any state ere fancy have confound her want with those of nature men content with the produce of their own field or with those rude improvements which they themselves can work upon them have little occasion for exchange at least for money which by agreement be the common measure of exchange the wool of the farmers own flock spin in his own family and work by a neighbour weaver who receive his payment in corn or wool suffice for furniture and cloathing the carpenter the smith the mason the tailor be retain by wag of a like nature and the landlord himself dwell in the neighbourhood be content to receive his rent in the commodities raise by the farmer the greater part of these he consume at home in rustic hospitality the rest perhaps he dispose of for money to the neighbour town whence he draw the few materials of his expence and luxury but after men begin to refine on all these enjoyments and live not always at home nor be content with what can be raise in their neighbourhood there be more exchange and commerce of all kinds and more money enter into that exchange the tradesmen will not be pay in corn because they want something more than barely to eat the farmer go beyond his own parish for the commodities he purchase and can not always carry his commodities to the merchant who supply him the landlord live in the capital or in a foreign country and demand his rent in gold and silver which can easily be transport to him great undertakers and manufacturers and merchants arise in every commodity and these can conveniently deal in nothing but in specie and consequently in this situation of society the coin enter into many more contract and by that mean be much more employ than in the former the necessary effect be that provide the money encrease not in the nation every thing must become much cheaper in time of industry and refinement than in rude uncultivated age it be the proportion between the circulate money and the commodities in the market which determine the price goods that be consume at home or exchange with other goods in the neighbourhood never come to market they affect not in the least the current specie with regard to it they be as if totally annihilate and consequently this method of use them sink the proportion on the side of the commodities and encreases the price but after money enter into all contract and sales and be every where the measure of exchange the same national cash have a much greater task to perform all commodities be then in the market the sphere of circulation be enlarge it be the same case as if that individual sum be to serve a larger kingdom and therefore the proportion be here lessen on the side of the money every thing must become cheaper and the price gradually fall by the most exact computations that have be form all over europe after make allowance for the alteration in the numerary value or the denomination it be find that the price of all things have only rise three or at most four time since the discovery of the west indies but will any one assert that there be not much more than four time the coin in europe that be in the fifteenth century and the centuries precede it the spaniards and portuguese from their mine the english french and dutch by their african trade and by their interlopers in the west indies bring home about g six millions a year of which not above a third go to the eastindies this sum alone in ten years would probably double the ancient stock of money in europe and no other satisfactory reason can be give why all price have not rise to a much more exorbitant height except that which be derive from a change of customs and manners besides that more commodities be produce by additional industry the same commodities come more to market after men depart from their ancient simplicity of manners and though this encrease have not be equal to that of money it have however be considerable and have preserve the proportion between coin and commodities nearer the ancient standard be the question propose which of these methods of live in the people the simple or refine be the most advantageous to the state or public should without much scruple prefer the latter in a view to politics at least and should produce this as an additional reason for the encouragement of trade and manufacture while men live in the ancient simple manner and supply all their necessaries from domestic industry or from the neighbourhood the sovereign can levy no tax in money from a considerable part of his subject and if he will impose on them any burthen he must take payment in commodities with which alone they abound a method attend with such great and obvious inconveniencies that they need not here be insist on all the money he can pretend to raise must be from his principal cities where alone it circulate and these it be evident can not afford him so much as the whole state could do gold and silver circulate throughout the whole but besides this obvious diminution of the revenue there be another cause of the poverty of the public in such a situation not only the sovereign receive less money but the same money go not so far as in time of industry and general commerce every thing be dearer where the gold and silver be suppose equal and that because fewer commodities come to market and the whole coin bear a higher proportion to what be to be purchase by it whence alone the price of every thing be fix and determine here then we may learn the fallacy of the remark often to be meet with in historians and even in common conversation that any particular state be weak though fertile populous and well cultivate merely because it want money it appear that the want of money can never injure any state within itself for men and commodities be the real strength of any community it be the simple manner of live which here hurt the public by confine the gold and silver to few hand and prevent its universal diffusion and circulation on the contrary industry and refinements of all kinds incorporate it with the whole state however small its quantity may be they digest it into every vein so to speak and make it enter into every transaction and contract no hand be entirely empty of it and as the price of every thing fall by that mean the sovereign have a double advantage he may draw money by his tax from every part of the state and what he receive go farther in every purchase and payment we may infer from a comparison of price that money be not more plentiful in china than it be in europe three centuries ago but what immense power be that empire possess of if we may judge by the civil and military establishment maintain by it polybius tell us that provision be so cheap in italy during his time that in some place theh state price for a meal at the inns be a semis a head little more than a farthing yet the roman power have even then subdue the whole know world about a century before that period the carthaginian ambassador say by way of raillery that no people live more sociably amongst themselves than the romans for that in every entertainment which as foreign minister they receive they still observe the same plate at every table the absolute quantity of the precious metal be a matter of great indifference there be only two circumstances of any importance namely their gradual encrease and their thorough concoction and circulation through the state and the influence of both these circumstances have here be explain in the follow essay we shall see an instance of a like fallacy as that above mention where a collateral effect be take for a cause and where a consequence be ascribe to the plenty of money though it be really owe to a change in the manners and customs of the people essay of interest nothing be esteem a more certain sign of the flourish condition of any nation than the lowness of interest and with reason though believe the cause be somewhat different from what be commonly apprehend lowness of interest be generally ascribe to plenty of money but money however plentiful have no other effect if fix than to raise the price of labour silver be more common than gold and therefore you receive a greater quantity of it for the same commodities but do you pay less interest for it interest in batavia and jamaica be at per cent in portugal at though these place as we may learn from the price of every thing abound more in gold and silver than either london or amsterdam be all the gold in england annihilate at once and one and twenty shill substitute in the place of every guinea would money be more plentiful or interest lower no surely we should only use silver instead of gold be gold render as common as silver and silver as common as copper would money be more plentiful or interest lower we may assuredly give the same answer our shill would then be yellow and our halfpence white and we should have no guineas no other difference would ever be observe no alteration on commerce manufacture navigation or interest unless we imagine that the colour of the metal be of any consequence now what be so visible in these greater variations of scarcity or abundance in the precious metal must hold in all inferior change if the multiply of gold and silver fifteen time make no difference much less can the double or triple them all augmentation have no other effect than to heighten the price of labour and commodities and even this variation be little more than that of a name in the progress towards these change the augmentation may have some influence by excite industry but after the price be settle suitably to the new abundance of gold and silver it have no manner of influence an effect always hold proportion with its cause price have rise near four time since the discovery of the indies and it be probable gold and silver have multiply much more but interest have not fall much above half the rate of interest therefore be not derive from the quantity of the precious metal money have chiefly a fictitious valuea the greater or less plenty of it be of no consequence if we consider a nation within itself and the quantity of specie when once fix though ever so large have no other effect than to oblige every one to tell out a greater number of those shin bits of metal for clothe furniture or equipage without encreasing any one convenience of life if a man borrow money to build a house he then carry home a greater load because the stone timber lead glass c with the labour of the masons and carpenter be represent by a greater quantity of gold and silver but as these metal be consider chiefly as representations there can no alteration arise from their bulk or quantity their weight or colour either upon their real value or their interest the same interest in all case bear the same proportion to the sum and if you lend me so much labour and so many commodities by receive five per cent you always receive proportional labour and commodities however represent whether by yellow or white coin whether by a pound or an ounce it be in vain therefore to look for the cause of the fall or rise of interest in the greater or less quantity of gold and silver which be fix in any nation high interest arise from three circumstances a great demand for borrow little riches to supply that demand and great profit arise from commerce and these circumstances be a clear proof of the small advance of commerce and industry not of the scarcity of gold and silver low interest on the other hand proceed from the three opposite circumstances a small demand for borrow great riches to supply that demand and small profit arise from commerce and these circumstances be all connect together and proceed from the encrease of industry and commerce not of gold and silver we shall endeavour to prove these point and shall begin with the cause and the effect of a great or small demand for borrow when a people have emerge ever so little from a savage state and their number have encreased beyond the original multitude there must immediately arise an inequality of property and while some possess large tracts of land others be confine within narrow limit and some be entirely without any land property those who possess more land than they can labour employ those who possess none and agree to receive a determinate part of the product thus the land interest be immediately establish nor be there any settle government however rude in which affairs be not on this foot of these proprietors of land some must presently discover themselves to be of different temper from others and while one would willingly store up the produce of his land for futurity another desire to consume at present what should suffice for many years but as the spend of a settle revenue be a way of life entirely without occupation men have so much need of somewhat to fix and engage them that pleasures such as they be will be the pursuit of the greater part of the landholders and the prodigals among them will always be more numerous than the misers in a state therefore where there be nothing but a land interest as there be little frugality the borrowers must be very numerous and the rate of interest must hold proportion to it the difference depend not on the quantity of money but on the habit and manners which prevail by this alone the demand for borrow be encreased or diminish be money so plentiful as to make an egg be sell for sixpence so long as there be only land gentry and peasants in the state the borrowers must be numerous and interest high the rent for the same farm would be heavier and more bulky but the same idleness of the landlord with the higher price of commodities would dissipate it in the same time and produce the same necessity and demand for borrowingb nor be the case different with regard to the second circumstance which we propose to consider namely the great or little riches to supply the demand this effect also depend on the habit and way of live of the people not on the quantity of gold and silver in order to have in any state a great number of lenders it be not sufficient nor requisite that there be great abundance of the precious metal it be only requisite that the property or command of that quantity which be in the state whether great or small should be collect in particular hand so as to form considerable sum or compose a great monied interest this beget a number of lenders and sink the rate of usury and this shall venture to affirm depend not on the quantity of specie but on particular manners and customs which make the specie gather into separate sum or mass of considerable value for suppose that by miracle every man in great britain should have five pound slipt into his pocket in one night this would much more than double the whole money that be at present in the kingdom yet there would not next day nor for some time be any more lenders nor any variation in the interest and be there nothing but landlords and peasants in the state this money however abundant could never gather into sum and would only serve to encrease the price of every thing without any farther consequence the prodigal landlord dissipate it as fast as he receive it and the beggarly peasant have no mean nor view nor ambition of obtain above a bare livelihood the overplus of borrowers above that of lenders continue still the same there will follow no reduction of interest that depend upon another principle and must proceed from an encrease of industry and frugality of arts and commerce every thing useful to the life of man arise from the grind but few things arise in that condition which be requisite to render them useful there must therefore beside the peasants and the proprietors of land be another rank of men who receive from the former the rude materials work them into their proper form and retain part for their own use and subsistence in the infancy of society these contract between the artisans and the peasants and between one species of artisans and another be commonly enter into immediately by the persons themselves who be neighbour be easily acquaint with each others necessities and can lend their mutual assistance to supply them but when mens industry encreases and their view enlarge it be find that the most remote part of the state can assist each other as well as the more contiguous and that this intercourse of good offices may be carry on to the greatest extent and intricacy hence the origin of merchants one of the most useful race of men who serve as agents between those part of the state that be wholly unacquainted and be ignorant of each others necessities here be in a city fifty workmen in silk and linen and a thousand customers and these two rank of men so necessary to each other can never rightly meet till one man erect a shop to which all the workmen and all the customers repair in this province grass rise in abundance the inhabitants abound in cheese and butter and cattle but want bread and corn which in a neighbour province be in too great abundance for the use of the inhabitants one man discover this he bring corn from the one province and return with cattle and supply the want of both he be so far a common benefactor as the people encrease in number and industry the difficulty of their intercourse encreases the business of the agency or merchandize become more intricate and divide subdivide compound and mix to a greater variety in all these transactions it be necessary and reasonable that a considerable part of the commodities and labour should belong to the merchant to whom in a great measure they be owe and these commodities he will sometimes preserve in kind or more commonly convert into money which be their common representation if gold and silver have encreased in the state together with the industry it will require a great quantity of these metal to represent a great quantity of commodities and labour if industry alone have encreased the price of every thing must sink and a small quantity of specie will serve as a representation there be no crave or demand of the human mind more constant and insatiable than that for exercise and employment and this desire seem the foundation of most of our passions and pursuits deprive a man of all business and serious occupation he run restless from one amusement to another and the weight and oppression which he feel from idleness be so great that he forget the ruin which must follow him from his immoderate expences give him a more harmless way of employ his mind or body he be satisfy and feel no longer that insatiable thirst after pleasure but if the employment you give him be lucrative especially if the profit be attach to every particular exertion of industry he have gain so often in his eye that he acquire by degrees a passion for it and know no such pleasure as that of see the daily encrease of his fortune and this be the reason why trade encreases frugality and why among merchants there be the same overplus of misers above prodigals as among the possessors of land there be the contrary commerce encreases industry by convey it readily from one member of the state to another and allow none of it to perish or become useless it encreases frugality by give occupation to men and employ them in the arts of gain which soon engage their affection and remove all relish for pleasure and expence it be an infallible consequence of all industrious professions to beget frugality and make the love of gain prevail over the love of pleasure among lawyers and physicians who have any practice there be many more who live within their income than who exceed it or even live up to it but lawyers and physicians beget no industry and it be even at the expence of others they acquire their riches so that they be sure to diminish the possessions of some of their fellowcitizens as fast as they encrease their own merchants on the contrary beget industry by serve as canal to convey it through every corner of the state and at the same time by their frugality they acquire great power over that industry and collect a large property in the labour and commodities which they be the chief instrument in produce there be no other profession therefore except merchandize which can make the monied interest considerable or in other word can encrease industry and by also encreasing frugality give a great command of that industry to particular members of the society without commerce the state must consist chiefly of land gentry whose prodigality and expence make a continual demand for borrow and of peasants who have no sum to supply that demand the money never gather into large stock or sum which can be lend at interest it be disperse into numberless hand who either squander it in idle show and magnificence or employ it in the purchase of the common necessaries of life commerce alone assemble it into considerable sum and this effect it have merely from the industry which it beget and the frugality which it inspire independent of that particular quantity of precious metal which may circulate in the state thus an encrease of commerce by a necessary consequence raise a great number of lenders and by that mean produce lowness of interest we must now consider how far this encrease of commerce diminish the profit arise from that profession and give rise to the third circumstance requisite to produce lowness of interest it may be proper to observe on this head that low interest and low profit of merchandize be two events that mutually forward each other and be both originally derive from that extensive commerce which produce opulent merchants and render the monied interest considerable where merchants possess great stock whether represent by few or many piece of metal it must frequently happen that when they either become tire of business or leave heirs unwilling or unfit to engage in commerce a great proportion of these riches naturally seek an annual and secure revenue the plenty diminish the price and make the lenders accept of a low interest this consideration oblige many to keep their stock employ in trade and rather be content with low profit than dispose of their money at an undervalue on the other hand when commerce have become extensive and employ large stock there must arise rivalships among the merchants which diminish the profit of trade at the same time that they encrease the trade itself the low profit of merchandize induce the merchants to accept more willingly of a low interest when they leave off business and begin to indulge themselves in ease and indolence it be needle therefore to enquire which of these circumstances to wit low interest or low profit be the cause and which the effect they both arise from an extensive commerce and mutually forward each other no man will accept of low profit where he can have high interest and no man will accept of low interest where he can have high profit an extensive commerce by produce large stock diminish both interest and profit and be always assist in its diminution of the one by the proportional sink of the other may add that as low profit arise from the encrease of commerce and industry they serve in their turn to its farther encrease by render the commodities cheaper encourage the consumption and heighten the industry and thus if we consider the whole connexion of cause and effect interest be the barometer of the state and its lowness be a sign almost infallible of the flourish condition of a people it prove the encrease of industry and its prompt circulation through the whole state little inferior to a demonstration and though perhaps it may not be impossible but a sudden and a great check to commerce may have a momentary effect of the same kind by throw so many stock out of trade it must be attend with such misery and want of employment in the poor that besides its short duration it will not be possible to mistake the one case for the other those who have assert that the plenty of money be the cause of low interest seem to have take a collateral effect for a cause since the same industry which sink the interest commonly acquire great abundance of the precious metal a variety of fine manufacture with vigilant enterprising merchants will soon draw money to a state if it be any where to be find in the world the same cause by multiply the conveniencies of life and encreasing industry collect great riches into the hand of persons who be not proprietors of land and produce by that mean a lowness of interest but though both these effect plenty of money and low interest naturally arise from commerce and industry they be altogether independent of each other for suppose a nation remove into the pacific ocean without any foreign commerce or any knowledge of navigation suppose that this nation possess always the same stock of coin but be continually encreasing in its number and industry it be evident that the price of every commodity must gradually diminish in that kingdom since it be the proportion between money and any species of goods which fix their mutual value and upon the present supposition the conveniencies of life become every day more abundant without any alteration in the current specie a less quantity of money therefore among this people will make a rich man during the time of industry than would suffice to that purpose in ignorant and slothful age less money will build a house portion a daughter buy an estate support a manufactory or maintain a family and equipage these be the use for which men borrow money and therefore the greater or less quantity of it in a state have no influence on the interest but it be evident that the greater or less stock of labour and commodities must have a great influence since we really and in effect borrow these when we take money upon interest it be true when commerce be extend all over the globe the most industrious nations always abound most with the precious metal so that low interest and plenty of money be in fact almost inseparable but still it be of consequence to know the principle whence any phenomenon arise and to distinguish between a cause and a concomitant effect besides that the speculation be curious it may frequently be of use in the conduct of public affairs at least it must be own that nothing can be of more use than to improve by practice the method of reason on these subject which of all others be the most important though they be commonly treat in the loosest and most careless manner another reason of this popular mistake with regard to the cause of low interest seem to be the instance of some nations where after a sudden acquisition of money or of the precious metal by mean of foreign conquest the interest have fall not only among them but in all the neighbour state as soon as that money be disperse and have insinuate itself into every corner thus interest in spain fell near a half immediately after the discovery of the west indies as we be inform by garcilasso de la vega and it have be ever since gradually sink in every kingdom of europe interest in rome after the conquest of egypt fell from to per cent as we learn from dion the cause of the sink of interest upon such an event seem different in the conquer country and in the neighbour state but in neither of them can we justly ascribe that effect merely to the encrease of gold and silver in the conquer country it be natural to imagine that this new acquisition of money will fall into a few hand and be gather into large sum which seek a secure revenue either by the purchase of land or by interest and consequently the same effect follow for a little time as if there have be a great accession of industry and commerce the encrease of lenders above the borrowers sink the interest and so much the faster if those who have acquire those large sum find no industry or commerce in the state and no method of employ their money but by lend it at interest but after this new mass of gold and silver have be digest and have circulate through the whole state affairs will soon return to their former situation while the landlords and new moneyholders live idly squander above their income and the former daily contract debt and the latter encroach on their stock till its final extinction the whole money may still be in the state and make itself felt by the encrease of price but not be now collect into any large mass or stock the disproportion between the borrowers and lenders be the same as formerly and consequently the high interest return accordingly we find in rome that so early as tiberiuss time interest have again mount to per cent though no accident have happen to drain the empire of money in trajans time money lend on mortgage in italy bore per cent on common securities in bithynia and if interest in spain have not rise to its old pitch this can be ascribe to nothing but the continuance of the same cause that sink it to wit the large fortunes continually make in the indies which come over to spain from time to time and supply the demand of the borrowers by this accidental and extraneous cause more money be to be lend in spain that be more money be collect into large sum than would otherwise be find in a state where there be so little commerce and industry as to the reduction of interest which have follow in england france and other kingdoms of europe that have no mine it have be gradual and have not proceed from the encrease of money consider merely in itself but from that of industry which be the natural effect of the former encrease in that interval before it raise the price of labour and provision for to return to the forego supposition if the industry of england have rise as much from other cause and that rise might easily have happen though the stock of money have remain the same must not all the same consequences have follow which we observe at present the same people would in that case be find in the kingdom the same commodities the same industry manufacture and commerce and consequently the same merchants with the same stock that be with the same command over labour and commodities only represent by a smaller number of white or yellow piece which be a circumstance of no moment would only affect the waggoner porter and trunkmaker luxury therefore manufacture arts industry frugality flourish equally as at present it be evident that interest must also have be as low since that be the necessary result of all these circumstances so far as they determine the profit of commerce and the proportion between the borrowers and lenders in any state essay of the balance of trade it be very usual in nations ignorant of the nature of commerce to prohibit the exportation of commodities and to preserve among themselves whatever they think valuable and useful they do not consider that in this prohibition they act directly contrary to their intention and that the more be export of any commodity the more will be raise at home of which they themselves will always have the first offer it be well know to the learn that the ancient laws of athens render the exportation of figs criminal that be suppose a species of fruit so excellent in attica that the athenians deem it too delicious for the palate of any foreigner and in this ridiculous prohibition they be so much in earnest that informers be thence call sycophants among them from two greek word which signify figs and discoverer a there be proof in many old act of parliament of the same ignorance in the nature of commerce particularly in the reign of edward and to this day in france the exportation of corn be almost always prohibit in order as they say to prevent famines though it be evident that nothing contribute more to the frequent famines which so much distress that fertile country the same jealous fear with regard to money have also prevail among several nations and it require both reason and experience to convince any people that these prohibitions serve to no other purpose than to raise the exchange against them and produce a still greater exportation these errors one may say be gross and palpable but there still prevail even in nations well acquaint with commerce a strong jealousy with regard to the balance of trade and a fear that all their gold and silver may be leave them this seem to me almost in every case a groundless apprehension and should as soon dread that all our spring and rivers should be exhaust as that money should abandon a kingdom where there be people and industry let us carefully preserve these latter advantage and we need never be apprehensive of lose the former it be easy to observe that all calculations concern the balance of trade be found on very uncertain facts and suppositions the customhouse book be allow to be an insufficient grind of reason nor be the rate of exchange much better unless we consider it with all nations and know also the proportion of the several sum remit which one may safely pronounce impossible every man who have ever reason on this subject have always prove his theory whatever it be by facts and calculations and by an enumeration of all the commodities send to all foreign kingdoms the write of mr gee strike the nation with an universal panic when they saw it plainly demonstrate by a detail of particulars that the balance be against them for so considerable a sum as must leave them without a single shill in five or six years but luckily twenty years have since elapse with an expensive foreign war yet be it commonly suppose that money be still more plentiful among us than in any former period nothing can be more entertain on this head than dr swift an authorb so quick in discern the mistake and absurdities of others he say in his short view of the state ofireland that the whole cash of that kingdom formerly amount but to l that out of this the irish remit every year a neat million to england and have scarcely any other source from which they could compensate themselves and little other foreign trade than the importation of french win for which they pay ready money the consequence of this situation which must be own to be disadvantageous be that in a course of three years the current money of ireland from l be reduce to less than two and at present suppose in a course of years it be absolutely nothing yet know not how that opinion of the advance of riches in ireland which give the doctor so much indignation seem still to continue and gain grind with every body in short this apprehension of the wrong balance of trade appear of such a nature that it discover itself wherever one be out of humour with the ministry or be in low spirit and as it can never be refute by a particular detail of all the export which counterbalance the import it may here be proper to form a general argument that may prove the impossibility of this event as long as we preserve our people and our industry suppose fourfifths of all the money in great britain to be annihilate in one night and the nation reduce to the same condition with regard to specie as in the reign of the harry and edwards what would be the consequence must not the price of all labour and commodities sink in proportion and every thing be sell as cheap as they be in those age what nation could then dispute with us in any foreign market or pretend to navigate or to sell manufacture at the same price which to us would afford sufficient profit in how little time therefore must this bring back the money which we have lose and raise us to the level of all the neighbour nations where after we have arrive we immediately lose the advantage of the cheapness of labour and commodities and the farther flow in of money be stop by our fulness and repletion again suppose that all the money of great britain be multiply fivefold in a night must not the contrary effect follow must not all labour and commodities rise to such an exorbitant height that no neighbour nations could afford to buy from us while their commodities on the other hand become comparatively so cheap that in spite of all the laws which could be form they would be run in upon us and our money flow out till we fall to a level with foreigners and lose that great superiority of riches which have lay us under such disadvantage now it be evident that the same cause which would correct these exorbitant inequalities be they to happen miraculously must prevent their happen in the common course of nature and must for ever in all neighbour nations preserve money nearly proportionable to the art and industry of each nation all water wherever it communicate remain always at a level ask naturalists the reason they tell you that be it to be raise in any one place the superior gravity of that part not be balance must depress it till it meet a counterpoise and that the same cause which redress the inequality when it happen must for ever prevent it without some violent external operation can one imagine that it have ever be possible by any laws or even by any art or industry to have keep all the money in spain which the galleons have bring from the indies or that all commodities could be sell in france for a tenth of the price which they would yield on the other side of the pyrenees without find their way thither and drain from that immense treasure what other reason indeed be there why all nations at present gain in their trade with spain and portugal but because it be impossible to heap up money more than any fluid beyond its proper level the sovereigns of these countries have show that they want not inclination to keep their gold and silver to themselves have it be in any degree practicable but as any body of water may be raise above the level of the surround element if the former have no communication with the latter so in money if the communication be cut off by any material or physical impediment for all laws alone be ineffectual there may in such a case be a very great inequality of money thus the immense distance of china together with the monopolies of our india company obstruct the communication preserve in europe the gold and silver especially the latter in much greater plenty than they be find in that kingdom but notwithstanding this great obstruction the force of the cause abovementioned be still evident the skill and ingenuity of europe in general surpass perhaps that of china with regard to manual arts and manufacture yet be we never able to trade thither without great disadvantage and be it not for the continual recruit which we receive from america money would soon sink in europe and rise in china till it come nearly to a level in both place nor can any reasonable man doubt but that industrious nation be they as near us as poland or barbary would drain us of the overplus of our specie and draw to themselves a larger share of the west indian treasure we need not have recourse to a physical attraction in order to explain the necessity of this operation there be a moral attraction arise from the interest and passions of men which be full as potent and infallible how be the balance keep in the provinces of every kingdom among themselves but by the force of this principle which make it impossible for money to lose its level and either to rise or sink beyond the proportion of the labour and commodities which be in each province do not long experience make people easy on this head what a fund of gloomy reflections might calculations afford to a melancholy yorkshireman while he compute and magnify the sum draw to london by tax absentees commodities and find on comparison the opposite article so much inferior and no doubt have the heptarchy subsist in england the legislature of each state have be continually alarm by the fear of a wrong balance and as it be probable that the mutual hatred of these state would have be extremely violent on account of their close neighbourhood they would have load and oppress all commerce by a jealous and superfluous caution since the union have remove the barriers between scotland and england which of these nations gain from the other by this free commerce or if the former kingdom have receive any encrease of riches can it reasonably be account for by any thing but the encrease of its art and industry it be a common apprehension in england before the union as we learn from labbe du bos that scotland would soon drain them of their treasure be an open trade allow and on the other side the tweed a contrary apprehension prevail with what justice in both time have show what happen in small portion of mankind must take place in greater the provinces of the roman empire no doubt keep their balance with each other and with italy independent of the legislature as much as the several counties of great britain or the several parishes of each county and any man who travel over europe at this day may see by the price of commodities that money in spite of the absurd jealousy of princes and state have bring itself nearly to a level and that the difference between one kingdom and another be not greater in this respect than it be often between different provinces of the same kingdom men naturally flock to capital cities seaports and navigable rivers there we find more men more industry more commodities and consequently more money but still the latter difference hold proportion with the former and the level be preserve our jealousy and our hatred of france be without bound and the former sentiment at least must be acknowledge reasonable and wellgrounded these passions have occasion innumerable barriers and obstructions upon commerce where we be accuse of be commonly the aggressors but what have we gain by the bargain we lose the french market for our woollen manufacture and transfer the commerce of wine to spain and portugal where we buy worse liquor at a higher price there be few englishmen who would not think their country absolutely ruin be french win sell in england so cheap and in such abundance as to supplant in some measure all ale and homebrewed liquors but would we lay aside prejudice it would not be difficult to prove that nothing could be more innocent perhaps advantageous each new acre of vineyard plant in france in order to supply england with wine would make it requisite for the french to take the produce of an english acre sow in wheat or barley in order to subsist themselves and it be evident that we should thereby get command of the better commodity there be many edicts of the french king prohibit the plant of new vineyards and order all those which be lately plant to be grub up so sensible be they in that country of the superior value of corn above every other product mareschal vauban complain often and with reason of the absurd duties which load the entry of those win of languedoc guienne and other southern provinces that be import into britanny and normandy he entertain no doubt but these latter provinces could preserve their balance notwithstanding the open commerce which he recommend and it be evident that a few league more navigation to england would make no difference or if it do that it must operate alike on the commodities of both kingdoms there be indeed one expedient by which it be possible to sink and another by which we may raise money beyond its natural level in any kingdom but these case when examine will be find to resolve into our general theory and to bring additional authority to it scarcely know any method of sink money below its level but those institutions of bank fund and papercredit c which be so much practise in this kingdom these render paper equivalent to money circulate it throughout the whole state make it supply the place of gold and silver raise proportionably the price of labour and commodities and by that mean either banish a great part of those precious metal or prevent their farther encrease what can be more shortsighted than our reason on this head we fancy because an individual would be much richer be his stock of money double that the same good effect would follow be the money of every one encreased not consider that this would raise as much the price of every commodity and reduce every man in time to the same condition as before it be only in our public negociations and transactions with foreigners that a greater stock of money be advantageous and as our paper be there absolutely insignificant we feel by its mean all the ill effect arise from a great abundance of money without reap any of the advantage suppose that there be millions of paper which circulate in the kingdom as money for we be not to imagine that all our enormous fund be employ in that shape and suppose the real cash of the kingdom to be millions here be a state which be find by experience to be able to hold a stock of millions say if it be able to hold it it must of necessity have acquire it in gold and silver have we not obstruct the entrance of these metal by this new invention of paper whence would it have acquire that sum from all the kingdoms of the world but why because if you remove these millions money in this state be below its level compare with our neighbour and we must immediately draw from all of them till we be full and saturate so to speak and can hold no more by our present politics we be as careful to stuff the nation with this fine commodity of bankbills and chequernotes as if we be afraid of be overburthened with the precious metal it be not to be doubt but the great plenty of bullion in france be in a great measure owe to the want of papercredit the french have no bank merchants bill do not there circulate as with us usury or lend on interest be not directly permit so that many have large sum in their coffers great quantities of plate be use in private house and all the church be full of it by this mean provision and labour still remain cheaper among them than in nations that be not half so rich in gold and silver the advantage of this situation in point of trade as well as in great public emergencies be too evident to be dispute the same fashion a few years ago prevail in genoa which still have place in england and holland of use service of chinaware instead of plate but the senate foresee the consequence prohibit the use of that brittle commodity beyond a certain extent while the use of silverplate be leave unlimited and suppose in their late distress they felt the good effect of this ordinance our tax on plate be perhaps in this view somewhat impolitic before the introduction of papermoney into our colonies they have gold and silver sufficient for their circulation since the introduction of that commodity the least inconveniency that have follow be the total banishment of the precious metal and after the abolition of paper can it be doubt but money will return while these colonies possess manufacture and commodities the only thing valuable in commerce and for whose sake alone all men desire money what pity lycurgus do not think of papercredit when he want to banish gold and silver from sparta it would have serve his purpose better than the lump of iron he make use of as money and would also have prevent more effectually all commerce with strangers as be of so much less real and intrinsic value d it must however be confess that as all these question of trade and money be extremely complicate there be certain light in which this subject may be place so as to represent the advantage of papercredit and bank to be superior to their disadvantage that they banish specie and bullion from a state be undoubtedly true and whoever look no farther than this circumstance do well to condemn them but specie and bullion be not of so great consequence as not to admit of a compensation and even an overbalance from the encrease of industry and of credit which may be promote by the right use of papermoney it be well know of what advantage it be to a merchant to be able to discount his bill upon occasion and every thing that facilitate this species of traffic be favourable to the general commerce of a state but private bankers be enable to give such credit by the credit they receive from the deposit of money in their shop and the bank of england in the same manner from the liberty it have to issue its note in all payments there be an invention of this kind which be fall upon some years ago by the bank of edinburgh and which as it be one of the most ingenious ideas that have be execute in commerce have also be think advantageous to scotland it be there call a bankcredit and be of this nature a man go to the bank and find surety to the amount we shall suppose of a thousand pound this money or any part of it he have the liberty of draw out whenever he please and he pay only the ordinary interest for it while it be in his hand he may when he please repay any sum so small as twenty pound and the interest be discount from the very day of the repayment the advantage result from this contrivance be manifold as a man may find surety nearly to the amount of his substance and his bankcredit be equivalent to ready money a merchant do hereby in a manner coin his house his household furniture the goods in his warehouse the foreign debts due to him his ship at sea and can upon occasion employ them in all payments as if they be the current money of the country if a man borrow a thousand pound from a private hand besides that it be not always to be find when require he pay interest for it whether he be use it or not his bankcredit cost him nothing except during the very moment in which it be of service to him and this circumstance be of equal advantage as if he have borrow money at much lower interest merchants likewise from this invention acquire a great facility in support each others credit which be a considerable security against bankruptcies a man when his own bankcredit be exhaust go to any of his neighbour who be not in the same condition and he get the money which he replace at his convenience e after this practice have take place during some years at edinburgh several company of merchants at glasgow carry the matter farther they associate themselves into different bank and issue note so low as ten shill which they use in all payments for goods manufacture tradesmens labour of all kinds and these note from the establish credit of the company pass as money in all payments throughout the country by this mean a stock of five thousand pound be able to perform the same operations as if it be six or seven and merchants be thereby enable to trade to a greater extent and to require less profit in all their transactions but whatever other advantage result from these inventions it must still be allow that besides give too great facility to credit which be dangerous they banish the precious metal and nothing can be a more evident proof of it than a comparison of the past and present condition of scotland in that particular it be find upon the recoinage make after the union that there be near a million of specie in that country but notwithstanding the great encrease of riches commerce and manufacture of all kinds it be think that even where there be no extraordinary drain make by england the current specie will not now amount to a third of that sum f but as our project of papercredit be almost the only expedient by which we can sink money below its level so in my opinion the only expedient by which we can raise money above it be a practice which we should all exclaim against as destructive namely the gather of large sum into a public treasure lock them up and absolutely prevent their circulation the fluid not communicate with the neighbour element may by such an artifice be raise to what height we please to prove this we need only return to our first supposition of annihilate the half or any part of our cash where we find that the immediate consequence of such an event would be the attraction of an equal sum from all the neighbour kingdoms nor do there seem to be any necessary bound set by the nature of things to this practice of hoard a small city like geneva continue this policy for age might engross ninetenths of the money of europe there seem indeed in the nature of man an invincible obstacle to that immense growth of riches a weak state with an enormous treasure will soon become a prey to some of its poorer but more powerful neighbour a great state would dissipate its wealth in dangerous and illconcerted project and probably destroy with it what be much more valuable the industry morals and number of its people the fluid in this case raise to too great a height burst and destroy the vessel that contain it and mix itself with the surround element soon fall to its proper level so little be we commonly acquaint with this principle that though all historians agree in relate uniformly so recent an event as the immense treasure amass by harry which they make amount to g pound we rather reject their concur testimony than admit of a fact which agree so ill with our inveterate prejudice it be indeed probable that this sum might be threefourths of all the money in england but where be the difficulty in conceive that such a sum might be amass in twenty years by a cunning rapacious frugal and almost absolute monarch nor be it probable that the diminution of circulate money be ever sensibly felt by the people or ever do them any prejudice the sink of the price of all commodities would immediately replace it by give england the advantage in its commerce with the neighbour kingdoms have we not an instance in the small republic of athens with its ally who in about fifty years between the median and peloponnesian war amass h a sum not much inferior to that of harry for all the greek historians and orators agree that the athenians collect in the citadel more than talents which they afterwards dissipate to their own ruin in rash and imprudent enterprizes but when this money be set a run and begin to communicate with the surround fluid what be the consequence do it remain in the state no for we find by the memorable census mention by demosthenes and polybius that in about fifty years afterwards the whole value of the republic comprehend land house commodities slave and money be less than talents what an ambitious highspirited people be this to collect and keep in their treasury with a view to conquests a sum which it be every day in the power of the citizens by a single vote to distribute among themselves and which would have go near to triple the riches of every individual for we must observe that the number and private riches of the athenians be say by ancient writers to have be no greater at the begin of the peloponnesian war than at the begin of the macedonian money be little more plentiful in greece during the age of philip and perseus than in england during that of harry yet these two monarchs in thirty years collect from the small kingdom of macedon a larger treasure than that of the english monarch paulus æmilius bring to rome about pound sterlingpliny say and that be but a part of the macedonian treasure the rest be dissipate by the resistance and flight of perseus we may learn from stanian that the canton of berne have pound lend at interest and have above six time as much in their treasury here then be a sum hoard of pound sterling which be at least quadruple what should naturally circulate in such a petty state and yet no one who travel in the pais de vaux or any part of that canton observe any want of money more than could be suppose in a country of that extent soil and situation on the contrary there be scarce any inland provinces in the continent of france or germany where the inhabitants be at this time so opulent though that canton have vastly encreased its treasure since the time when stanian write his judicious account of switzerland the account give by appian of the treasure of the ptolemies be so prodigious that one can not admit of it and so much the less because the historian say that the other successors of alexander be also frugal and have many of them treasure not much inferior for this save humour of the neighbour princes must necessarily have check the frugality of the egyptian monarchs accord to the forego theory the sum he mention be talents or pound shill and pence accord to dr arbuthnots computation and yet appian say that he extract his account from the public record and he be himself a native of alexandria from these principles we may learn what judgment we ought to form of those numberless bar obstructions and imposts which all nations of europe and none more than england have put upon trade from an exorbitant desire of amass money which never will heap up beyond its level while it circulate or from an illgrounded apprehension of lose their specie which never will sink below it could any thing scatter our riches it would be such impolitic contrivances but this general ill effect however result from them that they deprive neighbour nations of that free communication and exchange which the author of the world have intend by give them soil climates and geniuses so different from each other our modern politics embrace the only method of banish money the use of papercredit they reject the only method of amass it the practice of hoard and they adopt a hundred contrivances which serve to no purpose but to check industry and rob ourselves and our neighbour of the common benefit of art and nature all tax however upon foreign commodities be not to be regard as prejudicial or useless but those only which be found on the jealousy abovementioned a tax on german linen encourage home manufacture and thereby multiply our people and industry a tax on brandy encreases the sale of rum and support our southern colonies and as it be necessary that imposts should be levy for the support of government it may be think more convenient to lay them on foreign commodities which can easily be intercept at the port and subject to the impost we ought however always to remember the maxim of dr swift that in the arithmetic of the customs two and two make not four but often make only one it can scarcely be doubt but if the duties on wine be lower to a third they would yield much more to the government than at present our people might thereby afford to drink commonly a better and more wholesome liquor and no prejudice would ensue to the balance of trade of which we be so jealous the manufacture of ale beyond the agriculture be but inconsiderable and give employment to few hand the transport of wine and corn would not be much inferior but be there not frequent instance you will say of state and kingdoms which be formerly rich and opulent and be now poor and beggarly have not the money leave them with which they formerly abound answer if they lose their trade industry and people they can not expect to keep their gold and silver for these precious metal will hold proportion to the former advantage when lisbon and amsterdam get the eastindia trade from venice and genoa they also get the profit and money which arise from it where the seat of government be transfer where expensive armies be maintain at a distance where great fund be possess by foreigners there naturally follow from these cause a diminution of the specie but these we may observe be violent and forcible methods of carry away money and be in time commonly attend with the transport of people and industry but where these remain and the drain be not continue the money always find its way back again by a hundred canal of which we have no notion or suspicion what immense treasure have be spend by so many nations in flanders since the revolution in the course of three long war more money perhaps than the half of what be at present in europe but what have now become of it be it in the narrow compass of the austrian provinces no surely it have most of it return to the several countries whence it come and have follow that art and industry by which at first it be acquire i for above a thousand years the money of europe have be flow to rome by an open and sensible current but it have be empty by many secret and insensible canal and the want of industry and commerce render at present the papal dominions the poorest territory in all italy in short a government have great reason to preserve with care its people and its manufacture its money it may safely trust to the course of human affairs without fear or jealousy or if it ever give attention to this latter circumstance it ought only to be so far as it affect the former essay of the jealousy of trade have endeavour to remove one species of illfounded jealousy which be so prevalent among commercial nations it may not be amiss to mention another which seem equally groundless nothing be more usual among state which have make some advance in commerce than to look on the progress of their neighbour with a suspicious eye to consider all trade state as their rival and to suppose that it be impossible for any of them to flourish but at their expence in opposition to this narrow and malignant opinion will venture to assert that the encrease of riches and commerce in any one nation instead of hurt commonly promote the riches and commerce of all its neighbour and that a state can scarcely carry its trade and industry very far where all the surround state be bury in ignorance sloth and barbarism it be obvious that the domestic industry of a people can not be hurt by the greatest prosperity of their neighbour and as this branch of commerce be undoubtedly the most important in any extensive kingdom we be so far remove from all reason of jealousy but go farther and observe that where an open communication be preserve among nations it be impossible but the domestic industry of every one must receive an encrease from the improvements of the others compare the situation of great britain at present with what it be two centuries ago all the arts both of agriculture and manufacture be then extremely rude and imperfect every improvement which we have since make have arise from our imitation of foreigners and we ought so far to esteem it happy that they have previously make advance in arts and ingenuity but this intercourse be still uphold to our great advantage notwithstanding the advance state of our manufacture we daily adopt in every art the inventions and improvements of our neighbour the commodity be first import from abroad to our great discontent while we imagine that it drain us of our money afterwards the art itself be gradually import to our visible advantage yet we continue still to repine that our neighbour should possess any art industry and invention forget that have they not first instruct us we should have be at present barbarians and do they not still continue their instructions the arts must fall into a state of languor and lose that emulation and novelty which contribute so much to their advancement the encrease of domestic industry lay the foundation of foreign commerce where a great number of commodities be raise and perfect for the homemarket there will always be find some which can be export with advantage but if our neighbour have no art or cultivation they can not take them because they will have nothing to give in exchange in this respect state be in the same condition as individuals a single man can scarcely be industrious where all his fellowcitizens be idle the riches of the several members of a community contribute to encrease my riches whatever profession may follow they consume the produce of my industry and afford me the produce of theirs in return nor need any state entertain apprehensions that their neighbour will improve to such a degree in every art and manufacture as to have no demand from them nature by give a diversity of geniuses climates and soil to different nations have secure their mutual intercourse and commerce as long as they all remain industrious and civilize nay the more the arts encrease in any state the more will be its demand from its industrious neighbour the inhabitants have become opulent and skilful desire to have every commodity in the utmost perfection and as they have plenty of commodities to give in exchange they make large importations from every foreign country the industry of the nations from whom they import receive encouragement their own be also encreased by the sale of the commodities which they give in exchange but what if a nation have any staple commodity such as the woollen manufacture be in england must not the interfere of our neighbour in that manufacture be a loss to us answer that when any commodity be denominate the staple of a kingdom it be suppose that this kingdom have some peculiar and natural advantage for raise the commodity and if notwithstanding these advantage they lose such a manufacture they ought to blame their own idleness or bad government not the industry of their neighbour it ought also to be consider that by the encrease of industry among the neighbour nations the consumption of every particular species of commodity be also encreased and though foreign manufacture interfere with them in the market the demand for their product may still continue or even encrease and should it diminish ought the consequence to be esteem so fatal if the spirit of industry be preserve it may easily be divert from one branch to another and the manufacturers of wool for instance be employ in linen silk iron or any other commodities for which there appear to be a demand we need not apprehend that all the object of industry will be exhaust or that our manufacturers while they remain on an equal foot with those of our neighbour will be in danger of want employment the emulation among rival nations serve rather to keep industry alive in all of them and any people be happier who possess a variety of manufacture than if they enjoy one single great manufacture in which they be all employ their situation be less precarious and they will feel less sensibly those revolutions and uncertainties to which every particular branch of commerce will always be expose the only commercial state that ought to dread the improvements and industry of their neighbour be such a one as the dutch who enjoy no extent of land nor possess any number of native commodities flourish only by their be the broker and factor and carriers of others such a people may naturally apprehend that as soon as the neighbour state come to know and pursue their interest they will take into their own hand the management of their affairs and deprive their broker of that profit which they formerly reap from it but though this consequence may naturally be dread it be very long before it take place and by art and industry it may be ward off for many generations if not wholly elude the advantage of superior stock and correspondence be so great that it be not easily overcome and as all the transactions encrease by the encrease of industry in the neighbour state even a people whose commerce stand on this precarious basis may at first reap a considerable profit from the flourish condition of their neighbour the dutch have mortgage all their revenues make not such a figure in political transactions as formerly but their commerce be surely equal to what it be in the middle of the last century when they be reckon among the great power of europe be our narrow and malignant politics to meet with success we should reduce all our neighbour nations to the same state of sloth and ignorance that prevail in morocco and the coast of barbary but what would be the consequence they could send us no commodities they could take none from us our domestic commerce itself would languish for want of emulation example and instruction and we ourselves should soon fall into the same abject condition to which we have reduce them shall therefore venture to acknowledge that not only as a man but as a british subject pray for the flourish commerce of germany spain italy and even france itself be at least certain that great britain and all those nations would flourish more do their sovereigns and minister adopt such enlarge and benevolent sentiments towards each other essay of the balance of power it be a question whether the idea of the balance of power be owe entirely to modern policy or whether the phrase only have be invent in these later age it be certain that xenophon in his institution of cyrus represent the combination of the asiatic power to have arise from a jealousy of the encreasing force of the medes and persians and though that elegant composition should be suppose altogether a romance this sentiment ascribe by the author to the eastern princes be at least a proof of the prevail notion of ancient time in all the politics of greece the anxiety with regard to the balance of power be apparent and be expressly point out to us even by the ancient historians thucydides represent the league which be form against athens and which produce the peloponnesian war as entirely owe to this principle and after the decline of athens when the thebans and lacedemonians dispute for sovereignty we find that the athenians as well as many other republics always throw themselves into the lighter scale and endeavour to preserve the balance they support thebes against sparta till the great victory gain by epaminondas at leuctra after which they immediately go over to the conquer from generosity as they pretend but in reality from their jealousy of the conquerors whoever will read demostheness oration for the megalopolitans may see the utmost refinements on this principle that ever enter into the head of a venetian or english speculatist and upon the first rise of the macedonian power this orator immediately discover the danger sound the alarm throughout all greece and at last assemble that confederacy under the banners of athens which fight the great and decisive battle of chaeronea it be true the grecian war be regard by historians as war of emulation rather than of politics and each state seem to have have more in view the honour of lead the rest than any wellgrounded hop of authority and dominion if we consider indeed the small number of inhabitants in any one republic compare to the whole the great difficulty of form sieges in those time and the extraordinary bravery and discipline of every freeman among that noble people we shall conclude that the balance of power be of itself sufficiently secure in greece and need not to have be guard with that caution which may be requisite in other age but whether we ascribe the shift of side in all the grecian republics to jealous emulation or cautious politics the effect be alike and every prevail power be sure to meet with a confederacy against it and that often compose of its former friends and ally the same principle call it envy or prudence which produce the ostracism of athens and petalism of syracuse and expel every citizen whose fame or power overtop the rest the same principle say naturally discover itself in foreign politics and soon raise enemies to the lead state however moderate in the exercise of its authority the persian monarch be really in his force a petty prince compare to the grecian republics and therefore it behove him from view of safety more than from emulation to interest himself in their quarrel and to support the weaker side in every contest this be the advice give by alcibiades to tissaphernes and it prolong near a century the date of the persian empire till the neglect of it for a moment after the first appearance of the aspire genius of philip bring that lofty and frail edifice to the grind with a rapidity of which there be few instance in the history of mankind the successors of alexander show great jealousy of the balance of power a jealousy found on true politics and prudence and which preserve distinct for several age the partition make after the death of that famous conqueror the fortune and ambition of antigonus threaten them anew with a universal monarchy but their combination and their victory at ipsus save them and in subsequent time we find that as the eastern princes consider the greeks and macedonians as the only real military force with whom they have any intercourse they keep always a watchful eye over that part of the world the ptolemies in particular support first aratus and the achaeans and then cleomenes king of sparta from no other view than as a counterbalance to the macedonian monarchs for this be the account which polybius give of the egyptian politics the reason why it be suppose that the ancients be entirely ignorant of the balance of power seem to be draw from the roman history more than the grecian and as the transactions of the former be generally more familiar to us we have thence form all our conclusions it must be own that the romans never meet with any such general combination or confederacy against them as might naturally have be expect from the rapid conquests and declare ambition but be allow peaceably to subdue their neighbour one after another till they extend their dominion over the whole know world not to mention the fabulous history of theiraitalic war there be upon hannibals invasion of the roman state a remarkable crisis which ought to have call up the attention of all civilize nations it appear afterwards nor be it difficult to be observe at the time that this be a contest for universal empire yet no prince or state seem to have be in the least alarm about the event or issue of the quarrel philip of macedon remain neuter till he saw the victories of hannibal and then most imprudently form an alliance with the conqueror upon term still more imprudent he stipulate that he be to assist the carthaginian state in their conquest of italy after which they engage to send over force into greece to assist him in subdue the grecian commonwealths the rhodian and achaean republics be much celebrate by ancient historians for their wisdom and sound policy yet both of them assist the romans in their war against philip and antiochus and what may be esteem still a stronger proof that this maxim be not generally know in those age no ancient author have remark the imprudence of these measure nor have even blame that absurd treaty abovementioned make by philip with the carthaginians princes and statesmen in all age may beforehand be blind in their reason with regard to events but it be somewhat extraordinary that historians afterwards should not form a sounder judgment of them massinissa attalus prusias in gratify their private passions be all of them the instrument of the roman greatness and never seem to have suspect that they be forge their own chain while they advance the conquests of their ally a simple treaty and agreement between massinissa and the carthaginians so much require by mutual interest bar the romans from all entrance into africa and preserve liberty to mankind the only prince we meet with in the roman history who seem to have understand the balance of power be hiero king of syracuse though the ally of rome he send assistance to the carthaginians during the war of the auxiliaries esteem it requisite say polybius both in order to retain his dominions in sicily and to preserve the roman friendship that carthage should be safe lest by its fall the remain power should be able without contrast or opposition to execute every purpose and undertake and here he act with great wisdom and prudence for that be never on any account to be overlook nor ought such a force ever to be throw into one hand as to incapacitate the neighbour state from defend their right against it here be the aim of modern politics point out in express term in short the maxim of preserve the balance of power be found so much on common sense and obvious reason that it be impossible it could altogether have escape antiquity where we find in other particulars so many mark of deep penetration and discernment if it be not so generally know and acknowledge as at present it have at least an influence on all the wiser and more experience princes and politicians and indeed even at present however generally know and acknowledge among speculative reasoners it have not in practice an authority much more extensive among those who govern the world after the fall of the roman empire the form of government establish by the northern conquerors incapacitate them in a great measure for farther conquests and long maintain each state in its proper boundaries but when vassalage and the feudal militia be abolish mankind be anew alarm by the danger of universal monarchy from the union of so many kingdoms and principalities in the person of the emperor charles but the power of the house of austria found on extensive but divide dominions and their riches derive chiefly from mine of gold and silver be more likely to decay of themselves from internal defect than to overthrow all the bulwark raise against them in less than a century the force of that violent and haughty race be shatter their opulence dissipate their splendor eclipse a new power succeed more formidable to the liberties of europe possess all the advantage of the former and labour under none of its defect except a share of that spirit of bigotry and persecution with which the house of austria be so long and still be so much infatuate b in the general war maintain against this ambitious power great britain have stand foremost and she still maintain her station beside her advantage of riches and situation her people be animate with such a national spirit and be so fully sensible of the bless of their government that we may hope their vigour never will languish in so necessary and so just a cause on the contrary if we may judge by the past their passionate ardour seem rather to require some moderation and they have oftener err from a laudable excess than from a blameable deficiency in the first place we seem to have be more possess with the ancient greek spirit of jealous emulation than actuate by the prudent view of modern politics our war with france have be begin with justice and even perhaps from necessity but have always be too far push from obstinacy and passion the same peace which be afterwards make at ryswick in be offer so early as the year ninetytwo that conclude at utrecht in might have be finish on as good condition at gertruytenberg in the year eight and we might have give at frankfort in the same term which we be glad to accept of at aixlachapelle in the year fortyeight here then we see that above half of our war with france and all our public debts be owe more to our own imprudent vehemence than to the ambition of our neighbour in the second place we be so declare in our opposition to french power and so alert in defence of our ally that they always reckon upon our force as upon their own and expect to carry on war at our expence refuse all reasonable term of accommodation habent subjectos tanquam suos viles ut alienos all the world know that the factious vote of the house of commons in the begin of the last parliament with the profess humour of the nation make the queen of hungary inflexible in her term and prevent that agreement with prussia which would immediately have restore the general tranquillity of europe in the third place we be such true combatants that when once engage we lose all concern for ourselves and our posterity and consider only how we may best annoy the enemy to mortgage our revenues at so deep a rate in war where we be only accessories be surely the most fatal delusion that a nation which have any pretension to politics and prudence have ever yet be guilty of that remedy of fund if it be a remedy and not rather a poison ought in all reason to be reserve to the last extremity and no evil but the greatest and most urgent should ever induce us to embrace so dangerous an expedient these excesses to which we have be carry be prejudicial and may perhaps in time become still more prejudicial another way by beget as be usual the opposite extreme and render us totally careless and supine with regard to the fate of europe the athenians from the most bustle intrigue warlike people of greece find their error in thrust themselves into every quarrel abandon all attention to foreign affairs and in no contest ever take part on either side except by their flatteries and complaisance to the victor enormous monarchiesc be probably destructive to human nature in their progress in their continuance and even in their downfal which never can be very distant from their establishment the military genius which aggrandize the monarchy soon leave the court the capital and the center of such a government while the war be carry on at a great distance and interest so small a part of the state the ancient nobility whose affections attach them to their sovereign live all at court and never will accept of military employments which would carry them to remote and barbarous frontiers where they be distant both from their pleasures and their fortune the arm of the state must therefore be entrust to mercenary strangers without zeal without attachment without honour ready on every occasion to turn them against the prince and join each desperate malcontent who offer pay and plunder this be the necessary progress of human affairs thus human nature check itself in its airy elevation thus ambition blindly labour for the destruction of the conqueror of his family and of every thing near and dear to him the bourbons trust to the support of their brave faithful and affectionate nobility would push their advantage without reserve or limitation these while fire with glory and emulation can bear the fatigue and dangers of war but never would submit to languish in the garrison of hungary or lithuania forget at court and sacrifice to the intrigue of every minion or mistress who approach the prince the troop be fill with cravates and tartars hussars and cossacs intermingle perhaps with a few soldier of fortune from the better provinces and the melancholy fate of the roman emperors from the same cause be renew over and over again till the final dissolution of the monarchy essay of tax there be a prevail maxima among some reasoners that every new tax create a new ability in the subject to bear it and that each encrease of public burden encreases proportionably the industry of the people this maxim be of such a nature as be most likely to be abuse and be so much the more dangerous as its truth can not be altogether deny but it must be own when keep within certain bound to have some foundation in reason and experience when a tax be lay upon commodities which be consume by the common people the necessary consequence may seem to be either that the poor must retrench something from their way of live or raise their wag so as to make the burden of the tax fall entirely upon the rich but there be a third consequence which often follow upon tax namely that the poor encrease their industry perform more work and live as well as before without demand more for their labour where tax be moderate be lay on gradually and affect not the necessaries of life this consequence naturally follow and it be certain that such difficulties often serve to excite the industry of a people and render them more opulent and laborious than others who enjoy the greatest advantage for we may observe as a parallel instance that the most commercial nations have not always possess the greatest extent of fertile land but on the contrary that they have labour under many natural disadvantage tyre athens carthage rhodes genoa venice holland be strong examples to this purpose and in all history we find only three instance of large and fertile countries which have possess much trade the netherlands england and france the two former seem to have be allure by the advantage of their maritime situation and the necessity they lay under of frequent foreign port in order to procure what their own climate refuse them and as to france trade have come late into that kingdom and seem to have be the effect of reflection and observation in an ingenious and enterprizing people who remark the riches acquire by such of the neighbour nations as cultivate navigation and commerce the place mention by cicero as possess of the greatest commerce in his time be alexandria colchus tyre sidon andros cyprus pamphylia lycia rhodes chios byzantium lesbos smyrna miletum coo all these except alexandria be either small islands or narrow territories and that city owe its trade entirely to the happiness of its situation since therefore some natural necessities or disadvantage may be think favourable to industry why may not artificial burden have the same effect sir william temple we may observe ascribe the industry of the dutch entirely to necessity proceed from their natural disadvantage and illustrate his doctrine by a strike comparison with ireland where say he by the largeness and plenty of the soil and scarcity of people all things necessary to life be so cheap that an industrious man by two days labour may gain enough to fee him the rest of the week which take to be a very plain grind of the laziness attribute to the people for men naturally prefer ease before labour and will not take pain if they can live idle though when by necessity they have be inure to it they can not leave it be grow a custom necessary to their health and to their very entertainment nor perhaps be the change harder from constant ease to labour than from constant labour to ease after which the author proceed to confirm his doctrine by enumerate as above the place where trade have most flourish in ancient and modern time and which be commonly observe to be such narrow confine territories as beget a necessity for industryb the best tax be such as be levy upon consumptions especially those of luxury because such tax be least felt by the people they seem in some measure voluntary since a man may chuse how far he will use the commodity which be tax they be pay gradually and insensiblyc they naturally produce sobriety and frugality if judiciously impose and be confound with the natural price of the commodity they be scarcely perceive by the consumers their only disadvantage be that they be expensive in the levy tax upon possessions be levy without expence but have every other disadvantage most state however be oblige to have recourse to them in order to supply the deficiencies of the other but the most pernicious of all tax be the arbitrary they be commonly convert by their management into punishments on industry and also by their unavoidable inequality be more grievous than by the real burden which they impose it be surprise therefore to see them have place among any civilize people in general all polltaxes even when not arbitrary which they commonly be may be esteem dangerous because it be so easy for the sovereign to add a little more and a little more to the sum demand that these tax be apt to become altogether oppressive and intolerable on the other hand a duty upon commodities check itself and a prince will soon find that an encrease of the impost be no encrease of his revenue it be not easy therefore for a people to be altogether ruin by such tax historians inform us that one of the chief cause of the destruction of the roman state be the alteration which constantine introduce into the finance by substitute an universal polltax in lieu of almost all the tithe customs and excise which formerly compose the revenue of the empire the people in all the provinces be so grind and oppress by the publicans that they be glad to take refuge under the conquer arm of the barbarians whose dominion as they have fewer necessities and less art be find preferable to the refine tyranny of the romans d it be an opinion zealously promote by some political writers that since all tax as they pretend fall ultimately upon land it be better to lay them originally there and abolish every duty upon consumptions but it be deny that all tax fall ultimately upon land if a duty be lay upon any commodity consume by an artisan he have two obvious expedients for pay it he may retrench somewhat of his expence or he may encrease his labour both these resources be more easy and natural than that of heighten his wag we see that in years of scarcity the weaver either consume less or labour more or employ both these expedients of frugality and industry by which he be enable to reach the end of the year it be but just that he should subject himself to the same hardships if they deserve the name for the sake of the publick which give him protection by what contrivance can he raise the price of his labour the manufacturer who employ him will not give him more neither can he because the merchant who export the cloth can not raise its price be limit by the price which it yield in foreign market every man to be sure be desirous of push off from himself the burden of any tax which be impose and of lay it upon others but as every man have the same inclination and be upon the defensive no set of men can be suppose to prevail altogether in this contest and why the land gentleman should be the victim of the whole and should not be able to defend himself as well as others be can not readily imagine all tradesmen indeed would willingly prey upon him and divide him among them if they could but this inclination they always have though no tax be levy and the same methods by which he guard against the imposition of tradesmen before tax will serve him afterwards and make them share the burden with him e they must be very heavy tax indeed and very injudiciously levy which the artizan will not of himself be enable to pay by superior industry and frugality without raise the price of his labour shall conclude this subject with observe that we have with regard to tax an instance of what frequently happen in political institutions that the consequences of things be diametrically opposite to what we should expect on the first appearance it be regard as a fundamental maxim of the turkish government that the grand signior though absolute master of the live and fortunes of each individual have no authority to impose a new tax and every ottoman prince who have make such an attempt either have be oblige to retract or have find the fatal effect of his perseverance one would imagine that this prejudice or establish opinion be the firmest barrier in the world against oppression yet it be certain that its effect be quite contrary the emperor have no regular method of encreasing his revenue must allow all the bashaws and governors to oppress and abuse the subject and these he squeeze after their return from their government whereas if he could impose a new tax like our european princes his interest would so far be unite with that of his people that he would immediately feel the bad effect of these disorderly levy of money and would find that a pound raise by a general imposition would have less pernicious effect than a shill take in so unequal and arbitrary a manner essay of public credit it appear to have be the common practice of antiquity to make provision during peace for the necessities of war and to hoard up treasure beforehand as the instrument either of conquest or defence without trust to extraordinary impositions much less to borrow in time of disorder and confusion besides the immense sum above mention which be amass by athens and by the ptolemies and other successors of alexander we learn from plato that the frugal lacedemonians have also collect a great treasure and arrian and plutarch take notice of the riches which alexander get possession of on the conquest of susa and ecbatana and which be reserve some of them from the time of cyrus if remember right the scripture also mention the treasure of hezekiah and the jewish princes as profane history do that of philip and perseus kings of macedon the ancient republics of gaul have commonly large sum in reserve every one know the treasure seize in rome by julius cæsar during the civil war and we find afterwards that the wiser emperors augustus tiberius vespasian severus c always discover the prudent foresight of save great sum against any public exigency on the contrary our modern expedient which have become very general be to mortgage the public revenues and to trust that posterity will pay off the incumbrances contract by their ancestors and they have before their eye so good an example of their wise father have the same prudent reliance on their posterity who at last from necessity more than choice be oblige to place the same confidence in a new posterity but not to waste time in declaim against a practice which appear ruinous a beyond all controversy it seem pretty apparent that the ancient maxims be in this respect more prudent than the modern even though the latter have be confine within some reasonable bound and have ever in any instance be attend with such frugality in time of peace as to discharge the debts incur by an expensive war for why should the case be so different between the public and an individual as to make us establish different maxims of conduct for each if the fund of the former be greater its necessary expences be proportionably larger if its resources be more numerous they be not infinite and as its frame should be calculate for a much longer duration than the date of a single life or even of a family it should embrace maxims large durable and generous agreeably to the suppose extent of its existence to trust to chance and temporary expedients be indeed what the necessity of human affairs frequently render unavoidable but whoever voluntarily depend on such resources have not necessity but their own folly to accuse for their misfortunes when any such befal them if the abuse of treasure be dangerous either by engage the state in rash enterprizes or make it neglect military discipline in confidence of its riches the abuse of mortgage be more certain and inevitable poverty impotence and subjection to foreign power accord to modern policy war be attend with every destructive circumstance loss of men encrease of tax decay of commerce dissipation of money devastation by sea and land accord to ancient maxims the open of the public treasure as it produce an uncommon affluence of gold and silver serve as a temporary encouragement to industry and atone in some degree for the inevitable calamities of war b it be very tempt to a minister to employ such an expedient as enable him to make a great figure during his administration without overburthening the people with tax or excite any immediate clamour against himself the practice therefore of contract debt will almost infallibly be abuse in every government it would scarcely be more imprudent to give a prodigal son a credit in every bankers shop in london than to impower a statesman to draw bill in this manner upon posterity what then shall we say to the new paradox that public incumbrances be of themselves advantageous independent of the necessity of contract them and that any state even though it be not press by a foreign enemy could not possibly have embrace a wiser expedient for promote commerce and riches than to create fund and debts and tax without limitation reason such as these might naturally have pass for trials of wit among rhetoricians like the panegyrics on folly and a fever on busiris and nero have we not see such absurd maxims patronize by great minister and by a whole party among usc let us examine the consequences of public debts both in our domestic management by their influence on commerce and industry and in our foreign transactions by their effect on war and negociationsd public securities be with us become a kind of money and pass as readily at the current price as gold or silver wherever any profitable undertake offer itself how expensive soever there be never want hand enow to embrace it nor need a trader who have sum in the public stock fear to launch out into the most extensive trade since he be possess of fund which will answer the most sudden demand that can be make upon him no merchant think it necessary to keep by him any considerable cash bankstock or indiabonds especially the latter serve all the same purpose because he can dispose of them or pledge them to a banker in a quarter of an hour and at the same time they be not idle even when in his scritoire but bring him in a constant revenue in short our national debts furnish merchants with a species of money that be continually multiply in their hand and produce sure gain besides the profit of their commerce this must enable them to trade upon less profit the small profit of the merchant render the commodity cheaper cause a greater consumption quicken the labour of the common people and help to spread arts and industry throughout the whole society there be also we may observe in england and in all state which have both commerce and public debts a set of men who be half merchants half stockholders and may be suppose will to trade for small profit because commerce be not their principal or sole support and their revenues in the fund be a sure resource for themselves and their families be there no fund great merchants would have no expedient for realize or secure any part of their profit but by make purchase of land and land have many disadvantage in comparison of fund require more care and inspection it divide the time and attention of the merchant upon any tempt offer or extraordinary accident in trade it be not so easily convert into money and as it attract too much both by the many natural pleasures it afford and the authority it give it soon convert the citizen into the country gentleman more men therefore with large stock and incomes may naturally be suppose to continue in trade where there be public debts and this it must be own be of some advantage to commerce by diminish its profit promote circulation and encourage industrye but in opposition to these two favourable circumstances perhaps of no very great importance weigh the many disadvantage which attend our public debts in the whole interior œconomy of the state you will find no comparison between the ill and the good which result from them first it be certain that national debts cause a mighty confluence of people and riches to the capital by the great sum levy in the provinces to pay the interest and perhaps too by the advantage in trade above mention which they give the merchants in the capital above the rest of the kingdom the question be whether in our case it be for the public interest that so many privilege should be confer on london which have already arrive at such an enormous size and seem still encreasing some men be apprehensive of the consequences for my own part can not forbear think that though the head be undoubtedly too large for the body yet that great city be so happily situate that its excessive bulk cause less inconvenience than even a smaller capital to a greater kingdom there be more difference between the price of all provision in paris and languedoc than between those in london and yorkshire f the immense greatness indeed of london under a government which admit not of discretionary power render the people factious mutinous seditious and even perhaps rebellious but to this evil the national debts themselves tend to provide a remedy the first visible eruption or even immediate danger of public disorder must alarm all the stockholders whose property be the most precarious of any and will make them fly to the support of government whether menace by jacobitish violence or democratical frenzy secondly public stock be a kind of papercredit have all the disadvantage attend that species of money they banish gold and silver from the most considerable commerce of the state reduce them to common circulation and by that mean render all provision and labour dearer than otherwise they would beg thirdly the tax which be levy to pay the interest of these debtsh be apt either to heighten the price of labour or be an oppression on the poorer sort fourthly as foreigners possess a great share of our national fund they render the public in a manner tributary to them and may in time occasion the transport of our people and our industry fifthly the greater part of the public stock be always in the hand of idle people who live on their revenue our fund in that view give great encouragement to an useless and unactive life but though the injury that arise to commerce and industry from our public fund will appear upon balance the whole not inconsiderable it be trivial in comparison of the prejudice that result to the state consider as a body politic which must support itself in the society of nations and have various transactions with other state in war and negociations the ill there be pure and unmixed without any favourable circumstance to atone for it and it be an ill too of a nature the highest and most important we have indeed be tell that the public be no weaker upon account of its debts since they be mostly due among ourselves and bring as much property to one as they take from another it be like transfer money from the right hand to the leave which leave the person neither richer nor poorer than before such loose reason and specious comparisons will always pass where we judge not upon principles ask be it possible in the nature of things to overburthen a nation with tax even where the sovereign reside among them the very doubt seem extravagant since it be requisite in every community that there be a certain proportion observe between the laborious and the idle part of it but if all our present tax be mortgage must we not invent new ones and may not this matter be carry to a length that be ruinous and destructive in every nation there be always some methods of levy money more easy than others agreeably to the way of live of the people and the commodities they make use of in great britain the excise upon malt and beer afford a large revenue because the operations of malt and brew be tedious and be impossible to be conceal and at the same time these commodities be not so absolutely necessary to life as that the raise of their price would very much affect the poorer sort these tax be all mortgage what difficulty to find new ones what vexation and ruin of the poor duties upon consumptions be more equal and easy than those upon possessions what a loss to the public that the former be all exhaust and that we must have recourse to the more grievous method of levy tax be all the proprietors of land only stewards to the public must not necessity force them to practise all the arts of oppression use by stewards where the absence or negligence of the proprietor render them secure against enquiry it will scarcely be assert that no bound ought ever to be set to national debts and that the public would be no weaker be twelve or fifteen shill in the pound landtax mortgage with all the present customs and excise there be something therefore in the case beside the mere transfer of property from the one hand to another in years the posterity of those now in the coach and of those upon the box will probably have change place without affect the public by these revolutions i suppose the public once fairly bring to that condition to which it be hasten with such amaze rapidity suppose the land to be tax eighteen or nineteen shill in the pound for it can never bear the whole twenty suppose all the excise and customs to be screw up to the utmost which the nation can bear without entirely lose its commerce and industry and suppose that all those fund be mortgage to perpetuity and that the invention and wit of all our projectors can find no new imposition which may serve as the foundation of a new loan and let us consider the necessary consequences of this situation though the imperfect state of our political knowledge and the narrow capacities of men make it difficult to fortel the effect which will result from any untried measure the seed of ruin be here scatter with such profusion as not to escape the eye of the most careless observer in this unnatural state of society the only persons who possess any revenue beyond the immediate effect of their industry be the stockholders who draw almost all the rent of the land and house besides the produce of all the customs and excise these be men who have no connexions with the state who can enjoy their revenue in any part of the globe in which they chuse to reside who will naturally bury themselves in the capital or in great cities and who will sink into the lethargy of a stupid and pamper luxury without spirit ambition or enjoyment adieu to all ideas of nobility gentry and family the stock can be transfer in an instant and be in such a fluctuate state will seldom be transmit during three generations from father to son or be they to remain ever so long in one family they convey no hereditary authority or credit to the possessor and by this mean the several rank of men which form a kind of independent magistracy in a state institute by the hand of nature be entirely lose and every man in authority derive his influence from the commission alone of the sovereign no expedient remain for prevent or suppress insurrections but mercenary armies no expedient at all remain for resist tyranny elections be sway by bribery and corruption alone and the middle power between king and people be totally remove a grievous despotism must infallibly prevail the landholders despise for their poverty and hat for their oppressions will be utterly unable to make any opposition to it though a resolution should be form by the legislature never to impose any tax which hurt commerce and discourage industry it will be impossible for men in subject of such extreme delicacy to reason so justly as never to be mistake or amidst difficulties so urgent never to be seduce from their resolution the continual fluctuations in commerce require continual alterations in the nature of the tax which expose the legislature every moment to the danger both of wilful and involuntary error and any great blow give to trade whether by injudicious tax or by other accidents throw the whole system of government into confusion but what expedient can the public now employ even suppose trade to continue in the most flourish condition in order to support its foreign war and enterprizes and to defend its own honour and interest or those of its ally do not ask how the public be to exert such a prodigious power as it have maintain during our late war where we have so much exceed not only our own natural strength but even that of the greatest empires this extravagance be the abuse complain of as the source of all the dangers to which we be at present expose but since we must still suppose great commerce and opulence to remain even after every fund be mortgage these riches must be defend by proportional power and whence be the public to derive the revenue which support it it must plainly be from a continual taxation of the annuitants or which be the same thing from mortgage anew on every exigency a certain part of their annuities and thus make them contribute to their own defence and to that of the nation but the difficulties attend this system of policy will easily appear whether we suppose the king to have become absolute master or to be still controuled by national councils in which the annuitants themselves must necessarily bear the principal sway if the prince have become absolute as may naturally be expect from this situation of affairs it be so easy for him to encrease his exactions upon the annuitants which amount only to the retain money in his own hand that this species of property would soon lose all its credit and the whole income of every individual in the state must lie entirely at the mercy of the sovereign a degree of despotism which no oriental monarchy have ever yet attain if on the contrary the consent of the annuitants be requisite for every taxation they will never be persuade to contribute sufficiently even to the support of government as the diminution of their revenue must in that case be very sensible would not be disguise under the appearance of a branch of excise or customs and would not be share by any other order of the state who be already suppose to be tax to the utmost there be instance in some republics of a hundredth penny and sometimes of the fiftieth be give to the support of the state but this be always an extraordinary exertion of power and can never become the foundation of a constant national defence we have always find where a government have mortgage all its revenues that it necessarily sink into a state of languor inactivity and impotence such be the inconveniencies which may reasonably be foresee of this situation to which great britain be visibly tend not to mention the numberless inconveniencies which can not be foresee and which must result from so monstrous a situation as that of make the public the chief or sole proprietor of land besides invest it with every branch of customs and excise which the fertile imagination of minister and projectors have be able to invent must confess that there be a strange supineness from long custom creep into all rank of men with regard to public debts not unlike what divine so vehemently complain of with regard to their religious doctrines we all own that the most sanguine imagination can not hope either that this or any future ministry will be possess of such rigid and steady frugality as to make a considerable progress in the payment of our debts or that the situation of foreign affairs will for any long time allow them leisure and tranquillity for such an undertakingjwhat then be to become of us be we ever so good christians and ever so resign to providence this methinks be a curious question even consider as a speculative one and what it might not be altogether impossible to form some conjectural solution of the events here will depend little upon the contingencies of battle negociations intrigue and factions there seem to be a natural progress of things which may guide our reason as it would have require but a moderate share of prudence when we first begin this practice of mortgage to have foretell from the nature of men and of minister that things would necessarily be carry to the length we see so now that they have at last happily reach it it may not be difficult to guess at the consequences it must indeed be one of these two events either the nation must destroy public credit or public credit will destroy the nation it be impossible that they can both subsist after the manner they have be hitherto manage in this as well as in some other countries there be indeed a scheme for the payment of our debts which be propose by an excellent citizen mr hutchinson above thirty years ago and which be much approve of by some men of sense but never be likely to take effect he assert that there be a fallacy in imagine that the public owe this debt for that really every individual owe a proportional share of it and pay in his tax a proportional share of the interest beside the expence of levy these tax have we not better then say he make a distribution of the debt among ourselves and each of us contribute a sum suitable to his property and by that mean discharge at once all our fund and public mortgage he seem not to have consider that the laborious poor pay a considerable part of the tax by their annual consumptions though they could not advance at once a proportional part of the sum require not to mention that property in money and stock in trade might easily be conceal or disguise and that visible property in land and house would really at last answer for the whole an inequality and oppression which never would be submit to but though this project be not likely to take place it be not altogether improbable that when the nation become heartily sick of their debts and be cruelly oppress by them some dare projector may arise with visionary scheme for their discharge and as public credit will begin by that time to be a little frail the least touch will destroy it as happen in france during the regency and in this manner it will die of the doctork but it be more probable that the breach of national faith will be the necessary effect of war defeat misfortunes and public calamities or even perhaps of victories and conquests must confess when see princes and state fight and quarrel amidst their debts fund and public mortgage it always bring to my mind a match of cudgelplaying fight in a china shop how can it be expect that sovereigns will spare a species of property which be pernicious to themselves and to the public when they have so little compassion on live and properties that be useful to both let the time come and surely it will come when the new fund create for the exigencies of the year be not subscribe to and raise not the money project suppose either that the cash of the nation be exhaust or that our faith which have hitherto be so ample begin to fail us suppose that in this distress the nation be threaten with an invasion a rebellion be suspect or break out at home a squadron can not be equip for want of pay victual or repair or even a foreign subsidy can not be advance what must a prince or minister do in such an emergence the right of selfpreservation be unalienable in every individual much more in every community and the folly of our statesmen must then be greater than the folly of those who first contract debt or what be more than that of those who trust or continue to trust this security if these statesmen have the mean of safety in their hand and do not employ them the fund create and mortgage will by that time bring in a large yearly revenue sufficient for the defence and security of the nation money be perhaps lie in the exchequer ready for the discharge of the quarterly interest necessity call fear urge reason exhort compassion alone exclaim the money will immediately be seize for the current service under the most solemn protestations perhaps of be immediately replace but no more be requisite the whole fabric already totter fall to the grind and bury thousands in its ruin and this think may be call the natural death of public credit for to this period it tend as naturally as an animal body to its dissolution and destruction l so great dupe be the generality of mankind that notwithstanding such a violent shock to public credit as a voluntary bankruptcy in england would occasion it would not probably be long ere credit would again revive in as flourish a condition as before the present king of france during the late war borrow money at lower interest than ever his grandfather do and as low as the british parliament compare the natural rate of interest in both kingdoms and though men be commonly more govern by what they have see than by what they foresee with whatever certainty yet promise protestations fair appearances with the allurements of present interest have such powerful influence as few be able to resist mankind be in all age catch by the same bait the same trick play over and over again still trepan them the heights of popularity and patriotism be still the beat road to power and tyranny flattery to treachery stand armies to arbitrary government and the glory of god to the temporal interest of the clergy the fear of an everlasting destruction of credit allow it to be an evil be a needle bugbear a prudent man in reality would rather lend to the public immediately after we have take a spunge to our debts than at present as much as an opulent knave even though one could not force him to pay be a preferable debtor to an honest bankrupt for the former in order to carry on business may find it his interest to discharge his debts where they be not exorbitant the latter have it not in his power the reason of tacitus as it be eternally true be very applicable to our present case sed vulgus ad magnitudinem beneficiorum aderat stultissimus quisque pecuniis mercabatur apud sapientes cassa habebantur quæ neque dari neque accipi salva republica poterant the public be a debtor whom no man can oblige to pay the only check which the creditors have upon her be the interest of preserve credit an interest which may easily be overbalance by a great debt and by a difficult and extraordinary emergence even suppose that credit irrecoverable not to mention that a present necessity often force state into measure which be strictly speak against their interest these two events suppose above be calamitous but not the most calamitous thousands be thereby sacrifice to the safety of millions but we be not without danger that the contrary event may take place and that millions may be sacrifice for ever to the temporary safety of thousands our popular government perhaps will render it difficult or dangerous for a minister to venture on so desperate an expedient as that of a voluntary bankruptcy and though the house of lord be altogether compose of proprietors of land and the house of commons chiefly and consequently neither of them can be suppose to have great property in the fund yet the connections of the members may be so great with the proprietors as to render them more tenacious of public faith than prudence policy or even justice strictly speak require and perhaps too our foreign enemiesm may be so politic as to discover that our safety lie in despair and may not therefore show the danger open and barefaced till it be inevitable the balance of power in europe our grandfathers our father and we have all deem too unequal to be preserve without our attention and assistance but our children weary of the struggle and fetter with incumbrances may sit down secure and see their neighbour oppress and conquer till at last they themselves and their creditors lie both at the mercy of the conqueror and this may properly enough be denominate the violent death of our public credit these seem to be the events which be not very remote and which reason foresee as clearly almost as she can do any thing that lie in the womb of time and though the ancients maintain that in order to reach the gift of prophecy a certain divine fury or madness be requisite one may safely affirm that in order to deliver such prophecies as these no more be necessary than merely to be in ones sense free from the influence of popular madness and delusion essay of some remarkable customs shall observe three remarkable customs in three celebrate governments and shall conclude from the whole that all general maxims in politics ought to be establish with great caution and that irregular and extraordinary appearances be frequently discover in the moral as well as in the physical world the former perhaps we can better account for after they happen from spring and principles of which every one have within himself or from observation the strongest assurance and conviction but it be often fully as impossible for human prudence beforehand to foresee and foretel them one would think it essential to every supreme council or assembly which debate that entire liberty of speech should be grant to every member and that all motion or reason should be receive which can any wise tend to illustrate the point under deliberation one would conclude with still greater assurance that after a motion be make which be vote and approve by that assembly in which the legislative power be lodge the member who make the motion must for ever be exempt from future trial or enquiry but no political maxim can at first sight appear more undisputable than that he must at least be secure from all inferior jurisdiction and that nothing less than the same supreme legislative assembly in their subsequent meet could make him accountable for those motion and harangue to which they have before give their approbation but these axioms however irrefragable they may appear have all fail in the athenian government from cause and principles too which appear almost inevitable by the γραφ παρανόμων or indictment of illegality though it have not be remark by antiquaries or commentators any man be try and punish in a common court of judicature for any law which have pass upon his motion in the assembly of the people if that law appear to the court unjust or prejudicial to the public thus demosthenes find that shipmoney be levy irregularly and that the poor bore the same burden as the rich in equip the gallies correct this inequality by a very useful law which proportion the expence to the revenue and income of each individual he move for this law in the assembly he prove its advantage he convince the people the only legislature in athens the law pass and be carry into execution yet be he try in a criminal court for that law upon the complaint of the rich who resent the alteration that he have introduce into the finance he be indeed acquit upon prove anew the usefulness of his law ctesiphon move in the assembly of the people that particular honour should be confer on demosthenes as on a citizen affectionate and useful to the commonwealth the people convince of this truth vote those honour yet be ctesiphon try by the γραφ παρανόμων it be assert among other topics that demosthenes be not a good citizen nor affectionate to the commonwealth and the orator be call upon to defend his friend and consequently himself which he execute by that sublime piece of eloquence that have ever since be the admiration of mankind after the battle of chæronea a law be pass upon the motion of hyperides give liberty to slave and inrolling them in the troop on account of this law the orator be afterwards try by the indictment abovementioned and defend himself among other topics by that stroke celebrate by plutarch and longinus it be not say he that move for this law it be the necessities of war it be the battle ofchæronea the orations of demosthenes abound with many instance of trials of this nature and prove clearly that nothing be more commonly practise the athenian democracy be such a tumultuous government as we can scarcely form a notion of in the present age of the world the whole collective body of the people vote in every law without any limitation of property without any distinction of rank without controul from any magistracy or senate and consequently without regard to order justice or prudence the athenians soon become sensible of the mischiefs attend this constitution but be averse to check themselves by any rule or restriction they resolve at least to check their demagogues or counsellors by the fear of future punishment and enquiry they accordingly institute this remarkable law a law esteem so essential to their form of government that æschines insist on it as a know truth that be it abolish or neglect it be impossible for the democracy to subsist the people fear not any ill consequence to liberty from the authority of the criminal court because these be nothing but very numerous juries choose by lot from among the people and they justly consider themselves as in a state of perpetual pupillage where they have an authority after they come to the use of reason not only to retract and controul whatever have be determine but to punish any guardian for measure which they have embrace by his persuasion the same law have place in thebes and for the same reason it appear to have be a usual practice in athens on the establishment of any law esteem very useful or popular to prohibit for ever its abrogation and repeal thus the demagogue who divert all the public revenues to the support of show and spectacles make it criminal so much as to move for a repeal of this law thus leptines move for a law not only to recal all the immunities formerly grant but to deprive the people for the future of the power of grant any more thus all bill of attainder be forbid or laws that affect one athenian without extend to the whole commonwealth these absurd clauses by which the legislature vainly attempt to bind itself for ever proceed from an universal sense in the people of their own levity and inconstancy a wheel within a wheel such as we observe in the german empire be consider by lord shaftesbury as an absurdity in politics but what must we say to two equal wheel which govern the same political machine without any mutual check controul or subordination and yet preserve the greatest harmony and concord to establish two distinct legislatures each of which possess full and absolute authority within itself and stand in no need of the others assistance in order to give validity to its act this may appear beforehand altogether impracticable as long as men be actuate by the passions of ambition emulation and avarice which have hitherto be their chief govern principles and should assert that the state have in my eye be divide into two distinct factions each of which predominate in a distinct legislature and yet produce no clash in these independent power the supposition may appear incredible and if to augment the paradox should affirm that this disjoint irregular government be the most active triumphant and illustrious commonwealth that ever yet appear should certainly be tell that such a political chimera be as absurd as any vision of priests or poets but there be no need for search long in order to prove the reality of the forego suppositions for this be actually the case with the roman republic the legislative power be there lodge in the comitia centuriata and comitia tributa in the former it be well know the people vote accord to their census so that when the first class be unanimous though it contain not perhaps the hundredth part of the commonwealth it determine the whole and with the authority of the senate establish a law in the latter every vote be equal and as the authority of the senate be not there requisite the lower people entirely prevail and give law to the whole state in all partydivisions at first between the patricians and plebeians afterwards between the nobles and the people the interest of the aristocracy be predominant in the first legislature that of the democracy in the second the one could always destroy what the other have establish nay the one by a sudden and unforeseen motion might take the start of the other and totally annihilate its rival by a vote which from the nature of the constitution have the full authority of a law but no such contest be observe in the history of rome no instance of a quarrel between these two legislatures though many between the party that govern in each whence arise this concord which may seem so extraordinary the legislature establish in rome by the authority of servius tullius be the comitia centuriata which after the expulsion of the kings render the government for some time very aristocratical but the people have number and force on their side and be elate with frequent conquests and victories in their foreign war always prevail when push to extremity and first extort from the senate the magistracy of the tribunes and next the legislative power of the comitia tributa it then behove the nobles to be more careful than ever not to provoke the people for beside the force which the latter be always possess of they have now get possession of legal authority and could instantly break in piece any order or institution which directly oppose them by intrigue by influence by money by combination and by the respect pay to their character the nobles might often prevail and direct the whole machine of government but have they openly set their comitia centuriata in opposition to the tributa they have soon lose the advantage of that institution together with their consuls prætors ediles and all the magistrates elect by it but the comitia tributa not have the same reason for respect the centuriata frequently repeal laws favourable to the aristocracy they limit the authority of the nobles protect the people from oppression and controuled the action of the senate and magistracy the centuriata find it convenient always to submit and though equal in authority yet be inferior in power durst never directly give any shock to the other legislature either by repeal its laws or establish laws which it foresee would soon be repeal by it no instance be find of any opposition or struggle between these comitia except one slight attempt of this kind mention by appian in the third book of his civil warsmark anthony resolve to deprive decimus brutus of the government of cisalpine gaul rail in the forum and call one of the comitia in order to prevent the meet of the other which have be order by the senate but affairs be then fall into such confusion and the roman constitution be so near its final dissolution that no inference can be draw from such an expedient this contest besides be found more on form than party it be the senate who order the comitia tributa that they might obstruct the meet of the centuriata which by the constitution or at least form of the government could alone dispose of provinces cicero be recall by the comitia centuriata though banish by the tributa that be by a plebiscitum but his banishment we may observe never be consider as a legal deed arise from the free choice and inclination of the people it be always ascribe to the violence alone of clodius and to the disorder introduce by him into the government the third custom which we purpose to remark regard england and though it be not so important as those which we have point out in athens and rome be no less singular and unexpected it be a maxim in politics which we readily admit as undisputed and universal that a power however great when grant by law to an eminent magistrate be not so dangerous to liberty as an authority however inconsiderable which he acquire from violence and usurpation for besides that the law always limit every power which it bestow the very receive it as a concession establish the authority whence it be derive and preserve the harmony of the constitution by the same right that one prerogative be assume without law another may also be claim and another with still greater facility while the first usurpations both serve as precedents to the follow and give force to maintain them hence the heroism of hampdens conduct who sustain the whole violence of royal prosecution rather than pay a tax of twenty shill not impose by parliament hence the care of all english patriots to guard against the first encroachments of the crown and hence alone the existence at this day of english liberty there be however one occasion where the parliament have depart from this maxim and that be in the press of seamen the exercise of an irregular power be here tacitly permit in the crown and though it have frequently be under deliberation how that power might be render legal and grant under proper restrictions to the sovereign no safe expedient could ever be propose for that purpose and the danger to liberty always appear greater from law than from usurpation while this power be exercise to no other end than to man the navy men willingly submit to it from a sense of its use and necessity and the sailors who be alone affect by it find no body to support them in claim the right and privilege which the law grant without distinction to all english subject but be this power on any occasion make an instrument of faction or ministerial tyranny the opposite faction and indeed all lovers of their country would immediately take the alarm and support the injure party the liberty of englishmen would be assert juries would be implacable and the tool of tyranny act both against law and equity would meet with the severest vengeance on the other hand be the parliament to grant such an authority they would probably fall into one of these two inconveniencies they would either bestow it under so many restrictions as would make it lose its effect by cramp the authority of the crown or they would render it so large and comprehensive as might give occasion to great abuse for which we could in that case have no remedy the very irregularity of the practice at present prevent its abuse by afford so easy a remedy against them pretend not by this reason to exclude all possibility of contrive a register for seamen which might man the navy without be dangerous to liberty only observe that no satisfactory scheme of that nature have yet be propose rather than adopt any project hitherto invent we continue a practice seemingly the most absurd and unaccountable authority in time of full internal peace and concord be arm against law a continue violence be permit in the crown amidst the greatest jealousy and watchfulness in the people nay proceed from those very principles liberty in a country of the highest liberty be leave entirely to its own defence without any countenance or protection the wild state of nature be renew in one of the most civilize societies of mankind and great violence and disordera be commit with impunity while the one party plead obedience to the supreme magistrate the other the sanction of fundamental laws essay of the populousness of ancient nationsa there be very little grind either from reason or observation to conclude the world eternal or incorruptible the continual and rapid motion of matter the violent revolutions with which every part be agitate the change remark in the heavens the plain trace as well as tradition of an universal deluge or general convulsion of the elements all these prove strongly the mortality of this fabric of the world and its passage by corruption or dissolution from one state or order to another it must therefore as well as each individual form which it contain have its infancy youth manhood and old age and it be probable that in all these variations man equally with every animal and vegetable will partake in the flourish age of the world it may be expect that the human species should possess greater vigour both of mind and body more prosperous health higher spirit longer life and a stronger inclination and power of generation but if the general system of things and human society of course have any such gradual revolutions they be too slow to be discernible in that short period which be comprehend by history and tradition stature and force of body length of life even courage and extent of genius seem hitherto to have be naturally in all age pretty much the same the arts and sciences indeed have flourish in one period and have decay in another but we may observe that at the time when they rise to greatest perfection among one people they be perhaps totally unknown to all the neighbour nations and though they universally decay in one age yet in a succeed generation they again revive and diffuse themselves over the world as far therefore as observation reach there be no universal difference discernible in the human species and though it be allow that the universe like an animal body have a natural progress from infancy to old age yet as it must still be uncertain whether at present it be advance to its point of perfection or decline from it we can not thence presuppose any decay in human nature to prove therefore or account for that superior populousness of antiquity which be commonly suppose by the imaginary youth or vigour of the world will scarcely be admit by any just reasoner these general physical cause ought entirely to be exclude from this question there be indeed some more particular physical cause of importance diseases be mention in antiquity which be almost unknown to modern medicine and new diseases have arise and propagate themselves of which there be no trace in ancient history in this particular we may observe upon comparison that the disadvantage be much on the side of the moderns not to mention some others of less moment the smallpox commit such ravage as would almost alone account for the great superiority ascribe to ancient time the tenth or the twelfth part of mankind destroy every generation should make a vast difference it may be think in the number of the people and when join to venereal distemper a new plague diffuse every where this disease be perhaps equivalent by its constant operation to the three great scourge of mankind war pestilence and famine be it certain therefore that ancient time be more populous than the present and could no moral cause be assign for so great a change these physical cause alone in the opinion of many would be sufficient to give us satisfaction on that head but be it certain that antiquity be so much more populous as be pretend the extravagancies of vossius with regard to this subject be well know but an author of much greater genius and discernment have venture to affirm that accord to the best computations which these subject will admit of there be not now on the face of the earth the fiftieth part of mankind which exist in the time of julius cæsar it may easily be observe that the comparison in this case must be imperfect even though we confine ourselves to the scene of ancient history europe and the nations round the mediterranean we know not exactly the number of any european kingdom or even city at present how can we pretend to calculate those of ancient cities and state where historians have leave us such imperfect trace for my part the matter appear to me so uncertain that as intend to throw together some reflections on that head shall intermingle the enquiry concern cause with that concern facts which ought never to be admit where the facts can be ascertain with any tolerable assurance we shall first consider whether it be probable from what we know of the situation of society in both periods that antiquity must have be more populous secondly whether in reality it be so if can make it appear that the conclusion be not so certain as be pretend in favour of antiquity it be all aspire to in general we may observe that the question with regard to the comparative populousness of age or kingdoms imply important consequences and commonly determine concern the preference of their whole police their manners and the constitution of their government for as there be in all men both male and female a desire and power of generation more active than be ever universally exert the restraints which they lie under must proceed from some difficulties in their situation which it belong to a wise legislature carefully to observe and remove almost every man who think he can maintain a family will have one and the human species at this rate of propagation would more than double every generationb how fast do mankind multiply in every colony or new settlement where it be an easy matter to provide for a family and where men be nowise straiten or confine as in long establish governments history tell us frequently of plague which have sweep away the third or fourth part of a people yet in a generation or two the destruction be not perceive and the society have again acquire their former number the land which be cultivate the house build the commodities raise the riches acquire enable the people who escape immediately to marry and to rear families which supply the place of those who have perish and for a like reason every wise just and mild government by render the condition of its subject easy and secure will always abound most in people as well as in commodities and richesc a country indeed whose climate and soil be fit for vines will naturally be more populous than one which produce corn only and that more populous than one which be only fit for pasturage in general warm climates as the necessities of the inhabitants be there fewer and vegetation more powerful be likely to be most populous but if every thing else be equal it seem natural to expect that wherever there be most happiness and virtue and the wisest institutions there will also be most people the question therefore concern the populousness of ancient and modern time be allow of great importance it will be requisite if we would bring it to some determination to compare both the domestic and political situation of these two periods in order to judge of the facts by their moral cause which be the first view in which we propose to consider them the chief difference between the domestic œconomy of the ancients and that of the moderns consist in the practice of slavery which prevail among the former and which have be abolish for some centuries throughout the greater part of europe some passionate admirers of the ancients and zealous partizans of civil liberty for these sentiments as they be both of them in the main extremely just be find to be almost inseparable can not forbear regret the loss of this institution and whilst they brand all submission to the government of a single person with the harsh denomination of slavery they would gladly reduce the greater part of mankind to real slavery and subjection but to one who consider coolly on the subject it will appear that human nature in general really enjoy more liberty at present in the most arbitrary government of europe than it ever do during the most flourish period of ancient time as much as submission to a petty prince whose dominions extend not beyond a single city be more grievous than obedience to a great monarch so much be domestic slavery more cruel and oppressive than any civil subjection whatsoever the more the master be remove from us in place and rank the greater liberty we enjoy the less be our action inspect and control and the fainter that cruel comparison become between our own subjection and the freedom and even dominion of another the remain which be find of domestic slavery in the american colonies and among some european nations would never surely create a desire of render it more universal the little humanity commonly observe in persons accustom from their infancy to exercise so great authority over their fellowcreatures and to trample upon human nature be sufficient alone to disgust us with that unbounded dominion nor can a more probable reason be assign for the severe might say barbarous manners of ancient time than the practice of domestic slavery by which every man of rank be render a petty tyrant and educate amidst the flattery submission and low debasement of his slave accord to ancient practice all check be on the inferior to restrain him to the duty of submission none on the superior to engage him to the reciprocal duties of gentleness and humanity in modern time a bad servant find not easily a good master nor a bad master a good servant and the check be mutual suitably to the inviolable and eternal laws of reason and equity the custom of expose old useless or sick slave in an island of the tyber there to starve seem to have be pretty common in rome and whoever recover after have be so expose have his liberty give him by an edict of the emperor claudius in which it be likewise forbid to kill any slave merely for old age or sickness but suppose that this edict be strictly obey would it better the domestic treatment of slave or render their live much more comfortable we may imagine what others would practise when it be the profess maxim of the elder cato to sell his superannuate slave for any price rather than maintain what he esteem a useless burden the ergastula or dungeons where slave in chain be force to work be very common all over italy columella advise that they be always build under grind and recommend it as the duty of a careful overseer to call over every day the name of these slave like the muster of a regiment or ship company in order to know presently when any of them have desert a proof of the frequency of these ergastula and of the great number of slave usually confine in themd a chain slave for a porter be usual in rome as appear from ovid and other author have not these people shake off all sense of compassion towards that unhappy part of their species would they have present their friends at the first entrance with such an image of the severity of the master and misery of the slave nothing so common in all trials even of civil cause as to call for the evidence of slave which be always extort by the most exquisite torment demosthenes say that where it be possible to produce for the same fact either freemen or slave as witness the judge always prefer the torture of slave as a more certain evidence seneca draw a picture of that disorderly luxury which change day into night and night into day and invert every state hour of every office in life among other circumstances such as displace the meals and time of bath he mention that regularly about the third hour of the night the neighbour of one who indulge this false refinement hear the noise of whip and lash and upon enquiry find that he be then take an account of the conduct of his servants and give them due correction and discipline this be not remark as an instance of cruelty but only of disorder which even in action the most usual and methodical change the fix hours that an establish custom have assign for them but our present business be only to consider the influence of slavery on the populousness of a state it be pretend that in this particular the ancient practice have infinitely the advantage and be the chief cause of that extreme populousness which be suppose in those time at present all master discourage the marry of their male servants and admit not by any mean the marriage of the female who be then suppose altogether incapacitate for their service but where the property of the servants be lodge in the master their marriage form his riches and bring him a succession of slave that supply the place of those whom age and infirmity have disable he encourage therefore their propagation as much as that of his cattle rear the young with the same care and educate them to some art or call which may render them more useful or valuable to him the opulent be by this policy interest in the be at least though not in the wellbeing of the poor and enrich themselves by encreasing the number and industry of those who be subject to them each man be a sovereign in his own family have the same interest with regard to it as the prince with regard to the state and have not like the prince any opposite motives of ambition or vainglory which may lead him to depopulate his little sovereignty all of it be at all time under his eye and he have leisure to inspect the most minute detail of the marriage and education of his subject such be the consequences of domestic slavery accord to the first aspect and appearance of things but if we enter more deeply into the subject we shall perhaps find reason to retract our hasty determinations the comparison be shock between the management of human creatures and that of cattle but be extremely just when apply to the present subject it may be proper to trace the consequences of it at the capital near all great cities in all populous rich industrious provinces few cattle be breed provision lodge attendance labour be there dear and men find their account better in buy the cattle after they come to a certain age from the remoter and cheaper countries these be consequently the only breed countries for cattle and by a parity of reason for men too when the latter be put on the same foot with the former to rear a child in london till he could be serviceable would cost much dearer than to buy one of the same age from scotland or ireland where he have be breed in a cottage cover with rag and feed on oatmeal or potatoes those who have slave therefore in all the richer and more populous countries would discourage the pregnancy of the females and either prevent or destroy the birth the human species would perish in those place where it ought to encrease the fastest and a perpetual recruit be want from the poorer and more desert provinces such a continue drain would tend mightily to depopulate the state and render great cities ten time more destructive than with us where every man be master of himself and provide for his children from the powerful instinct of nature not the calculations of sordid interest if london at present without much encreasing need a yearly recruit from the country of people as be usually compute what must it require if the greater part of the tradesmen and common people be slave and be hinder from breed by their avaricious master all ancient author tell us that there be a perpetual flux of slave to italy from the remoter provinces particularly syria ciliciacappadocia and the lesser asia thrace and ægypt yet the number of people do not encrease in italy and writers complain of the continual decay of industry and agriculture where then be that extreme fertility of the roman slave which be commonly suppose so far from multiply they could not it seem so much as keep up the stock without immense recruit and though great number be continually manumit and convert into roman citizens the number even of these do not encrease till the freedom of the city be communicate to foreign provinces the term for a slave bear and breed in the family be verna and these slave seem to have be entitle by custom to privilege and indulgences beyond others a sufficient reason why the master would not be fond of rear many of that kind whoever be acquaint with the maxims of our planters will acknowledge the justness of this observation atticus be much praise by his historian for the care which he take in recruit his family from the slave bear in it may we not thence infer that this practice be not then very common the name of slave in the greek comedies syrus mysus geta thrax davus lydus phryx c afford a presumption that at athens at least most of the slave be import from foreign countries the athenians say strabo give to their slave either the name of the nations whence they be buy as lydus syrus or the name that be most common among those nations as man or midas to a phrygian tibias to a paphlagonian demosthenes have mention a law which forbid any man to strike the slave of another praise the humanity of this law and add that if the barbarians from whom the slave be buy have information that their countrymen meet with such gentle treatment they would entertain a great esteem for the atheniansisocrates too insinuate that the slave of the greeks be generally or very commonly barbariansfaristotle in his politics plainly suppose that a slave be always a foreigner the ancient comic writers represent the slave as speak a barbarous language this be an imitation of nature it be well know that demosthenes in his nonage have be defraud of a large fortune by his tutor and that afterwards he recover by a prosecution at law the value of his patrimony his orations on that occasion still remain and contain an exact detail of the whole substance leave by his father in money merchandise house and slave together with the value of each particular among the rest be slave handicraftsmen namely swordcutlers and cabinetmakers all males not a word of any wive children or family which they certainly would have have have it be a common practice at athens to breed from the slave and the value of the whole must have much depend on that circumstance no female slave be even so much as mention except some housemaids who belong to his mother this argument have great force if it be not altogether conclusive consider this passage of plutarch speak of the elder cato he have a great number of slave whom he take care to buy at the sales of prisoners of war and he choose them young that they might easily be accustom to any diet or manner of life and be instruct in any business or labour as men teach any thing to young dog or horsesand esteem love the chief source of all disorder he allow the male slave to have a commerce with the female in his family upon pay a certain sum for this privilege but he strictly prohibit all intrigue out of his family be there any symptoms in this narration of that care which be suppose in the ancients of the marriage and propagation of their slave if that be a common practice found on general interest it would surely have be embrace by cato who be a great œconomist and live in time when the ancient frugality and simplicity of manners be still in credit and reputation it be expressly remark by the writers of the roman law that scarcely any ever purchase slave with a view of breed from them our lackeys and housemaids own do not serve much to multiply their species but the ancients besides those who attend on their person have almost all their labour perform g and even manufacture execute by slave who live many of them in their family and some great men possess to the number of if there be any suspicion therefore that this institution be unfavourable to propagation and the same reason at least in part hold with regard to ancient slave as modern servants how destructive must slavery have prove history mention a roman nobleman who have slave under the same roof with him and have be assassinate at home by the furious revenge of one of them the law be execute with rigour and all without exception be put to death many other roman noblemen have families equally or more numerous and believe every one will allow that this would scarcely be practicable be we to suppose all the slave marry and the females to be breeders so early as the poet hesiod marry slave whether male or female be esteem inconvenient how much more where families have encreased to such an enormous size as in rome and where the ancient simplicity of manners be banish from all rank of people xenophon in his oeconomics where he give directions for the management of a farm recommend a strict care and attention of lay the male and the female slave at a distance from each other he seem not to suppose that they be ever marry the only slave among the greeks that appear to have continue their own race be the helotes who have house apart and be more the slave of the public than of individuals h the same author tell us that niciass overseer by agreement with his master be oblige to pay him an obolus a day for each slave besides maintain them and keep up the number have the ancient slave be all breeders this last circumstance of the contract have be superfluous the ancients talk so frequently of a fix state portion of provision assign to each slave that we be naturally lead to conclude that slave live almost all single and receive that portion as a kind of boardwages the practice indeed of marry slave seem not to have be very common even among the countrylabourers where it be more naturally to be expect cato enumerate the slave requisite to labour a vineyard of a hundred acres make them amount to the overseer and his wife villicus and villica and male slave for an olive plantation of acres the overseer and his wife and male slave and so in proportion to a greater or less plantation or vineyard varro quote this passage of cato allow his computation to be just in every respect except the last for as it be requisite say he to have an overseer and his wife whether the vineyard or plantation be great or small this must alter the exactness of the proportion have catos computation be erroneous in any other respect it have certainly be correct by varro who seem fond of discover so trivial an error the same author as well as columella recommend it as requisite to give a wife to the overseer in order to attach him the more strongly to his master service this be therefore a peculiar indulgence grant to a slave in whom so great confidence be repose in the same place varro mention it as an useful precaution not to buy too many slave from the same nation lest they beget factions and seditions in the family a presumption that in italy the greater part even of the country labour slave for he speak of no other be buy from the remoter provinces all the world know that the family slave in rome who be instrument of show and luxury be commonly import from the east hoc profecere say pliny speak of the jealous care of master mancipiorum legiones et in domo turba externa ac servorum quoque causa nomenclator adhibendus it be indeed recommend by varro to propagate young shepherd in the family from the old ones for as grasing farm be commonly in remote and cheap place and each shepherd live in a cottage apart his marriage and encrease be not liable to the same inconveniencies as in dearer place and where many servants live in the family which be universally the case in such of the roman farm as produce wine or corn if we consider this exception with regard to shepherd and weigh the reason of it it will serve for a strong confirmation of all our forego suspicions columella own advise the master to give a reward and even liberty to a female slave that have rear him above three children a proof that sometimes the ancients propagate from their slave which indeed can not be deny be it otherwise the practice of slavery be so common in antiquity must have be destructive to a degree which no expedient could repair all pretend to infer from these reason be that slavery be in general disadvantageous both to the happiness and populousness of mankind and that its place be much better supply by the practice of hire servants the laws or as some writers call them the seditions of the gracchi be occasion by their observe the encrease of slave all over italy and the diminution of free citizens appian ascribe this encrease to the propagation of the slave plutarch to the purchase of barbarians who be chain and imprison βαρβαρικα δεσμωτηρια it be to be presume that both cause concur sicily say florus be full of ergastula and be cultivate by labourers in chain eunus and athenio excite the servile war by break up these monstrous prisons and give liberty to slave the younger pompey augment his army in spain by the same expedient if the country labourers throughout the roman empire be so generally in this situation and if it be difficult or impossible to find separate lodge for the families of the city servants how unfavourable to propagation as well as to humanity must the institution of domestic slavery be esteem constantinople at present require the same recruit of slave from all the provinces that rome do of old and these provinces be of consequence far from be populous egypt accord to mons maillet send continual colonies of black slave to the other part of the turkish empire and receive annually an equal return of white the one bring from the inland part of africa the other from mingrelia circassia and tartary our modern convents be no doubt bad institutions but there be reason to suspect that anciently every great family in italy and probably in other part of the world be a species of convent and though we have reason to condemn all those popish institutions as nurseriesj of superstition burthensome to the public and oppressive to the poor prisoners male as well as female yet may it be question whether they be so destructive to the populousness of a state as be commonly imagine be the land which belong to a convent bestow on a nobleman he would spend its revenue on dog horse groom footmen cook and housemaids and his family would not furnish many more citizens than the convent the common reason why any parent thrust his daughters into nunneries be that he may not be overburthened with too numerous a family but the ancients have a method almost as innocent and more effectual to that purpose to wit expose their children in early infancy this practice be very common and be not speak of by any author of those time with the horror it deserve or scarcely even with disapprobation plutarch the humane goodnatured plutarch mention it as a merit in attalus king of pergamus that he murder or if you will expose all his own children in order to leave his crown to the son of his brother eumenes signalize in this manner his gratitude and affection to eumenes who have leave him his heir preferably to that son it be solon the most celebrate of the sag of greece that give parent permission by law to kill their children shall we then allow these two circumstances to compensate each other to wit monastic vow and the expose of children and to be unfavourable in equal degrees to the propagation of mankind doubt the advantage be here on the side of antiquity perhaps by an odd connexion of cause the barbarous practice of the ancients might rather render those time more populous by remove the terrors of too numerous a family it would engage many people in marriage and such be the force of natural affection that very few in comparison would have resolution enough when it come to the push to carry into execution their former intentions china the only country where this practice of expose children prevail at present be the most populous country we know of and every man be marry before he be twenty such early marriages could scarcely be general have not men the prospect of so easy a method of get rid of their children own that plutarch speak of it as a very general maxim of the poor to expose their children and as the rich be then averse to marriage on account of the courtship they meet with from those who expect legacies from them the public must have be in a bad situation between them of all sciences there be none where first appearances be more deceitful than in politics hospitals for foundlings seem favourable to the encrease of number and perhaps may be so when keep under proper restrictions but when they open the door to every one without distinction they have probably a contrary effect and be pernicious to the state it be compute that every ninth child bear at paris be send to the hospital though it seem certain accord to the common course of human affairs that it be not a hundredth child whose parent be altogether incapacitate to rear and educate him the k great difference for health industry and morals between an education in an hospital and that in a private family should induce us not to make the entrance into the former too easy and engage to kill ones own child be shock to nature and must therefore be somewhat unusual but to turn over the care of him upon others be very tempt to the natural indolence of mankind have consider the domestic life and manners of the ancients compare to those of the moderns where in the main we seem rather superior so far as the present question be concern we shall now examine the political customs and institutions of both age and weigh their influence in retard or forward the propagation of mankind before the encrease of the roman power or rather till its full establishment almost all the nations which be the scene of ancient history be divide into small territories or petty commonwealths where of course a great equality of fortune prevail and the center of the government be always very near its frontiers this be the situation of affairs not only in greece and italy but also in spain gaul germany afric and a great part of the lesser asia and it must be own that no institution could be more favourable to the propagation of mankind for though a man of an overgrow fortune not be able to consume more than another must share it with those who serve and attend him yet their possession be precarious they have not the same encouragement to marry as if each have a small fortune secure and independent enormous cities be besides destructive to society beget vice and disorder of all kinds starve the remoter provinces and even starve themselves by the price to which they raise all provision where each man have his little house and field to himself and each county have its capital free and independent what a happy situation of mankind how favourable to industry and agriculture to marriage and propagation the prolific virtue of men be it to act in its full extent without that restraint which poverty and necessity impose on it would double the number every generation and nothing surely can give it more liberty than such small commonwealths and such an equality of fortune among the citizens all small state naturally produce equality of fortune because they afford no opportunities of great encrease but small commonwealths much more by that division of power and authority which be essential to them when xenophon return after the famous expedition with cyrus he hire himself and of the greeks into the service of seuthes a prince of thrace and the article of his agreement be that each soldier should receive a daric a month each captain two darics and he himself as general four a regulation of pay which would not a little surprise our modern officer demosthenes and æschines with eight more be send ambassadors to philip of macedon and their appointments for above four months be a thousand drachmas which be less than a drachma a day for each ambassador but a drachma a day nay sometimes two be the pay of a common footsoldier a centurion among the romans have only double pay to a private man in polybiuss time and we accordingly find the gratuities after a triumph regulate by that proportion but mark anthony and the triumvirate give the centurions five time the reward of the other so much have the encrease of the commonwealth encreased the inequality among the citizens it must be own that the situation of affairs in modern time with regard to civil liberty as well as equality of fortune be not near so favourable either to the propagation or happiness of mankind europe be share out mostly into great monarchies and such part of it as be divide into small territories be commonly govern by absolute princes who ruin their people by a mimicry of the greater monarchs in the splendor of their court and number of their force swisserland alone and holland resemble the ancient republics and though the former be far from possess any advantage either of soil climate or commerce yet the number of people with which it abound notwithstanding their enlist themselves into every service in europe prove sufficiently the advantage of their political institutions the ancient republics derive their chief or only security from the number of their citizens the trachinians have lose great number of their people the remainder instead of enrich themselves by the inheritance of their fellowcitizens apply to sparta their metropolis for a new stock of inhabitants the spartans immediately collect ten thousand men among whom the old citizens divide the land of which the former proprietors have perish after timoleon have banish dionysius from syracuse and have settle the affairs of sicily find the cities of syracuse and sellinuntium extremely depopulate by tyranny war and faction he invite over from greece some new inhabitants to repeople them immediately forty thousand men plutarch say sixty thousand offer themselves and he distribute so many lot of land among them to the great satisfaction of the ancient inhabitants a proof at once of the maxims of ancient policy which affect populousness more than riches and of the good effect of these maxims in the extreme populousness of that small country greece which could at once supply so great a colony the case be not much different with the romans in early time he be a pernicious citizen say curius who can not be content with seven acres such ideas of equality could not fail of produce great number of people we must now consider what disadvantage the ancients lay under with regard to populousness and what check they receive from their political maxims and institutions there be commonly compensations in every human condition and though these compensations be not always perfectly equal yet they serve at least to restrain the prevail principle to compare them and estimate their influence be indeed difficult even where they take place in the same age and in neighbour countries but where several age have intervene and only scatter light be afford us by ancient author what can we do but amuse ourselves by talk pro and con on an interest subject and thereby correct all hasty and violent determinations first we may observe that the ancient republics be almost in perpetual war a natural effect of their martial spirit their love of liberty their mutual emulation and that hatred which generally prevail among nations that live in close neighbourhood now war in a small state be much more destructive than in a great one both because all the inhabitants in the former case must serve in the armies and because the whole state be frontier and be all expose to the inroads of the enemy the maxims of ancient war be much more destructive than those of modern chiefly by that distribution of plunder in which the soldier be indulge the private men in our armies be such a low set of people that we find any abundance beyond their simple pay breed confusion and disorder among them and a total dissolution of discipline the very wretchedness and meanness of those who fill the modern armies render them less destructive to the countries which they invade one instance among many of the deceitfulness of first appearances in all political reason ancient battle be much more bloody by the very nature of the weapons employ in them the ancients draw up their men or sometimes men deep which make a narrow front and it be not difficult to find a field in which both armies might be marshal and might engage with each other even where any body of the troop be keep off by hedge hillocks woods or hollow ways the battle be not so soon decide between the contend party but that the others have time to overcome the difficulties which oppose them and take part in the engagement and as the whole army be thus engage and each man closely buckle to his antagonist the battle be commonly very bloody and great slaughter be make on both side especially on the vanquish the long thin line require by firearms and the quick decision of the fray render our modern engagements but partial rencounters and enable the general who be foil in the begin of the day to draw off the greater part of his army sound and entirel the battle of antiquity both by their duration and their resemblance to single combat be work up to a degree of fury quite unknown to later age nothing could then engage the combatants to give quarter but the hop of profit by make slave of their prisoners in civil war as we learn from tacitus the battle be the most bloody because the prisoners be not slave what a stout resistance must be make where the vanquish expect so hard a fate how inveterate the rage where the maxims of war be in every respect so bloody and severe instance be frequent in ancient history of cities besiege whose inhabitants rather than open their gate murder their wive and children and rush themselves on a voluntary death sweeten perhaps by a little prospect of revenge upon the enemy greeks as well as barbarians have often be work up to this degree of fury and the same determine spirit and cruelty must in other instance less remarkable have be destructive to human society in those petty commonwealths which live in close neighbourhood and be engage in perpetual war and contentions sometimes the war in greece say plutarch be carry on entirely by inroads and robberies and piracies such a method of war must be more destructive in small state than the bloodiest battle and sieges by the laws of the twelve table possession during two years form a prescription for land one year for moveables an indication that there be not in italy at that time much more order tranquillity and settle police than there be at present among the tartars the only cartel remember in ancient history be that between demetrius poliorcetes and the rhodians when it be agree that a free citizen should be restore for drachmas a slave bear arm for but secondly it appear that ancient manners be more unfavourable than the modern not only in time of war but also in those of peace and that too in every respect except the love of civil liberty and of equality which be own of considerable importance to exclude faction from a free government be very difficult if not altogether impracticable but such inveterate rage between the factions and such bloody maxims be find in modern time amongst religious party alonen in ancient history we may always observe where one party prevail whether the nobles or people for can observe no difference in this respect that they immediately butcher all of the opposite party who fell into their hand and banish such as have be so fortunate as to escape their fury no form of process no law no trial no pardon a fourth a third perhaps near half of the city be slaughter or expel every revolution and the exile always join foreign enemies and do all the mischief possible to their fellowcitizens till fortune put it in their power to take full revenge by a new revolution and as these be frequent in such violent governments the disorder diffidence jealousy enmity which must prevail be not easy for us to imagine in this age of the world there be only two revolutions can recollect in ancient history which pass without great severity and great effusion of blood in massacre and assassinations namely the restoration of the athenian democracy by thrasybulus and the subdue of the roman republic by cæsar we learn from ancient history that thrasybulus pass a general amnesty for all past offences and first introduce that word as well as practice into greece it appear however from many orations of lysias that the chief and even some of the subaltern offenders in the precede tyranny be try and capitally punishedo and as to cæsars clemency though much celebrate it would not gain great applause in the present age he butcher for instance all catos senate when he become master of utica and these we may readily believe be not the most worthless of the party all those who have bear arm against that usurper be attaint and by hirtiuss law declare incapable of all public offices these people be extremely fond of liberty but seem not to have understand it very well when the thirty tyrants first establish their dominion at athens they begin with seize all the sycophants and informers who have be so troublesome during the democracy and put them to death by an arbitrary sentence and execution every man say sallust and lysiaswas rejoice at these punishments not consider that liberty be from that moment annihilate the utmost energy of the nervous style of thucydides and the copiousness and expression of the greek language seem to sink under that historian when he attempt to describe the disorder which arise from faction throughout all the grecian commonwealths you would imagine that he still labour with a think greater than he can find word to communicate and he conclude his pathetic description with an observation which be at once refine and solid in these contest say he those who be the dullest and most stupid and have the least foresight commonly prevail for be conscious of this weakness and dread to be overreach by those of greater penetration they go to work hastily without premeditation by the sword and poinard and thereby get the start of their antagonists who be form fine scheme and project for their destruction not to mention dionysius the elder who be compute to have butcher in cool blood above of his fellowcitizens or agathoclesnabis and others still more bloody than he the transactions even in free governments be extremely violent and destructive at athens the thirty tyrants and the nobles in a twelvemonth murder without trial about of the people and banish above the half of the citizens that remain in argos near the same time the people kill of the nobles and afterwards their own demagogues because they have refuse to carry their prosecutions farther the people also in corcyra kill of the nobles and banish a thousand these number will appear the more surprise if we consider the extreme smallness of these state but all ancient history be full of such instance when alexander order all the exile to be restore throughout all the cities it be find that the whole amount to men the remain probably of still greater slaughter and massacre what an astonish multitude in so narrow a country as ancient greece and what domestic confusion jealousy partiality revenge heartburnings must tear those cities where factions be work up to such a degree of fury and despair it would be easier say isocrates to philip to raise an army in greece at present from the vagabond than from the cities even when affairs come not to such extremities which they fail not to do almost in every city twice or thrice every century property be render very precarious by the maxims of ancient government xenophon in the banquet of socrates give us a natural unaffected description of the tyranny of the athenian people in my poverty say charmides be much more happy than ever be while possess of riches as much as it be happier to be in security than in terrors free than a slave to receive than to pay court to be trust than suspect formerly be oblige to caress every informer some imposition be continually lay upon me and it be never allow me to travel or be absent from the city at present when be poor look big and threaten others the rich be afraid of me and show me every kind of civility and respect and be become a kind of tyrant in the city in one of the plead of lysias the orator very coolly speak of it by the by as a maxim of the athenian people that whenever they want money they put to death some of the rich citizens as well as strangers for the sake of the forfeiture in mention this he seem not to have any intention of blame them still less of provoke them who be his audience and judge whether a man be a citizen or a stranger among that people it seem indeed requisite either that he should impoverish himself or that the people would impoverish him and perhaps kill him into the bargain the orator last mention give a pleasant account of an estate lay out in the public service that be above the third of it in rareeshows and figure dance need not insist on the greek tyrannies which be altogether horrible even the mix monarchies by which most of the ancient state of greece be govern before the introduction of republics be very unsettle scarcely any city but athens say isocrates could show a succession of kings for four or five generations besides many other obvious reason for the instability of ancient monarchies the equal division of property among the brothers in private families must by a necessary consequence contribute to unsettle and disturb the state the universal preference give to the elder by modern laws though it encreases the inequality of fortunes have however this good effect that it accustom men to the same idea in public succession and cut off all claim and pretension of the younger the new settle colony of heraclea fall immediately into faction apply to sparta who send heripidas with full authority to quiet their dissentions this man not provoke by any opposition not inflame by party rage know no better expedient than immediately put to death about of the citizens a strong proof how deeply root these violent maxims of government be throughout all greece if such be the disposition of mens mind among that refine people what may be expect in the commonwealths of italy afric spain and gaul which be denominate barbarous why otherwise do the greeks so much value themselves on their humanity gentleness and moderation above all other nations this reason seem very natural but unluckily the history of the roman commonwealth in its earlier time if we give credit to the receive account present an opposite conclusion no blood be ever shed in any sedition at rome till the murder of the gracchi dionysius halicarnassæus observe the singular humanity of the roman people in this particular make use of it as an argument that they be originally of grecian extraction whence we may conclude that the factions and revolutions in the barbarous republics be usually more violent than even those of greece abovementioned if the romans be so late in come to blow they make ample compensation after they have once enter upon the bloody scene and appians history of their civil war contain the most frightful picture of massacre proscriptions and forfeitures that ever be present to the world what please most in that historian be that he seem to feel a proper resentment of these barbarous proceed and talk not with that provoke coolness and indifference which custom have produce in many of the greek historians the maxims of ancient politics contain in general so little humanity and moderation that it seem superfluous to give any particular reason for the act of violence commit at any particular period yet can not forbear observe that the laws in the later period of the roman commonwealth be so absurdly contrive that they oblige the head of party to have recourse to these extremities all capital punishments be abolish however criminal or what be more however dangerous any citizen might be he could not regularly be punish otherwise than by banishment and it become necessary in the revolutions of party to draw the sword of private vengeance nor be it easy when laws be once violate to set bound to these sanguinary proceed have brutus himself prevail over the triumvirate could he in common prudence have allow octavius and anthony to live and have content himself with banish them to rhodes or marseilles where they might still have plot new commotions and rebellions his execute antonius brother to the triumvir show evidently his sense of the matter do not cicero with the approbation of all the wise and virtuous of rome arbitrarily put to death catilines accomplices contrary to law and without any trial or form of process and if he moderate his executions do it not proceed either from the clemency of his temper or the conjunctures of the time a wretched security in a government which pretend to laws and liberty thus one extreme produce another in the same manner as excessive severity in the laws be apt to beget great relaxation in their execution so their excessive lenity naturally produce cruelty and barbarity it be dangerous to force us in any case to pass their sacred boundaries one general cause of the disorder so frequent in all ancient governments seem to have consist in the great difficulty of establish any aristocracy in those age and the perpetual discontent and seditions of the people whenever even the meanest and most beggarly be exclude from the legislature and from public offices the very quality of freemen give such a rank be oppose to that of slave that it seem to entitle the possessor to every power and privilege of the commonwealth solons laws exclude no freeman from vote or elections but confine some magistracies to a particular census yet be the people never satisfy till those laws be repeal by the treaty with antipater no athenian be allow a vote whose census be less than drachmas about l sterling and though such a government would to us appear sufficiently democratical it be so disagreeable to that people that above twothirds of them immediately leave their countrycassander reduce that census to the half yet still the government be consider as an oligarchical tyranny and the effect of foreign violence servius tulliuss laws seem equal and reasonable by fix the power in proportion to the property yet the roman people could never be bring quietly to submit to them in those days there be no medium between a severe jealous aristocracy rule over discontent subject and a turbulent factious tyrannical democracyr at present there be not one republic in europe from one extremity of it to the other that be not remarkable for justice lenity and stability equal to or even beyond marseilles rhodes or the most celebrate in antiquity almost all of them be welltempered aristocracies but thirdly there be many other circumstances in which ancient nations seem inferior to the modern both for the happiness and encrease of mankind trade manufacture industry be no where in former age so flourish as they be at present in europe the only garb of the ancients both for males and females seem to have be a kind of flannel which they wear commonly white or grey and which they scour as often as it become dirty tyre which carry on after carthage the greatest commerce of any city in the mediterranean before it be destroy by alexander be no mighty city if we credit arrians account of its inhabitantsathens be commonly suppose to have be a trade city but it be as populous before the median war as at any time after it accord to herodotus yet its commerce at that time be so inconsiderable that as the same historian observe even the neighbour coast of asia be as little frequent by the greeks as the pillars of hercules for beyond these he conceive nothing great interest of money and great profit of trade be an infallible indication that industry and commerce be but in their infancy we read in lysias of per cent profit make on a cargo of two talents send to no greater distance than from athens to the adriatic nor be this mention as an instance of extraordinary profit antidorus say demosthenes pay three talents and a half for a house which he let at a talent a year and the orator blame his own tutor for not employ his money to like advantage my fortune say he in eleven years minority ought to have be triple the value of of the slave leave by his father he compute at minas and the yearly profit of their labour at the most moderate interest at athens for there be higher often pay be per cent and that pay monthly not to insist upon the high interest to which the vast sum distribute in elections have raise money at rome we find that verres before that factious period state per cent for money which he leave in the hand of the publicans and though cicero exclaim against this article it be not on account of the extravagant usury but because it have never be customary to state any interest on such occasion interest indeed sink at rome after the settlement of the empire but it never remain any considerable time so low as in the commercial state of modern time among the other inconveniencies which the athenians felt from the fortify of decelia by the lacedemonians it be represent by thucydides as one of the most considerable that they could not bring over their corn from eubea by land pass by oropus but be oblige to embark it and to sail round the promontory of sunium a surprise instance of the imperfection of ancient navigation for the watercarriage be not here above double the land do not remember a passage in any ancient author where the growth of a city be ascribe to the establishment of a manufacture the commerce which be say to flourish be chiefly the exchange of those commodities for which different soil and climates be suit the sale of wine and oil into africa accord to diodorus siculus be the foundation of the riches of agrigentum the situation of the city of sybaris accord to the same author be the cause of its immense populousness be build near the two rivers crathys and sybaris but these two rivers we may observe be not navigable and could only produce some fertile vallies for agriculture and tillage an advantage so inconsiderable that a modern writer would scarcely have take notice of it the barbarity of the ancient tyrants together with the extreme love of liberty which animate those age must have banish every merchant and manufacturer and have quite depopulate the state have it subsist upon industry and commerce while the cruel and suspicious dionysius be carry on his butcheries who that be not detain by his land property and could have carry with him any art or skill to procure a subsistence in other countries would have remain expose to such implacable barbarity the persecutions of philip and lewis fill all europe with the manufacturers of flanders and of france grant that agriculture be the species of industry chiefly requisite to the subsistence of multitudes and it be possible that this industry may flourish even where manufacture and other arts be unknown and neglect swisserland be at present a remarkable instance where we find at once the most skilful husbandmen and the most bungle tradesmen that be to be meet with in europe that agriculture flourish in greece and italy at least in some part of them and at some periods we have reason to presume and whether the mechanical arts have reach the same degree of perfection may not be esteem so material especially if we consider the great equality of riches in the ancient republics where each family be oblige to cultivate with the greatest care and industry its own little field in order to its subsistence but be it just reason because agriculture may in some instance flourish without trade or manufacture to conclude that in any great extent of country and for any great tract of time it would subsist alone the most natural way surely of encourage husbandry be first to excite other kinds of industry and thereby afford the labourer a ready market for his commodities and a return of such goods as may contribute to his pleasure and enjoyment this method be infallible and universal and as it prevail more in modern government than in the ancient it afford a presumption of the superior populousness of the former every man say xenophon may be a farmer no art or skill be requisite all consist in industry and in attention to the execution a strong proof as columella hint that agriculture be but little know in the age of xenophon all our later improvements and refinements have they do nothing towards the easy subsistence of men and consequently towards their propagation and encrease our superior skill in mechanics the discovery of new worlds by which commerce have be so much enlarge the establishment of post and the use of bill of exchange these seem all extremely useful to the encouragement of art industry and populousness be we to strike off these what a check should we give to every kind of business and labour and what multitudes of families would immediately perish from want and hunger and it seem not probable that we could supply the place of these new inventions by any other regulation or institution have we reason to think that the police of ancient state be any wise comparable to that of modern or that men have then equal security either at home or in their journies by land or water question not but every impartial examiner would give us the preference in this particular thus upon compare the whole it seem impossible to assign any just reason why the world should have be more populous in ancient than in modern time the equality of property among the ancients liberty and the small divisions of their state be indeed circumstances favourable to the propagation of mankind but their war be more bloody and destructive their governments more factious and unsettle commerce and manufacture more feeble and languish and the general police more loose and irregular these latter disadvantage seem to form a sufficient counterbalance to the former advantage and rather favour the opposite opinion to that which commonly prevail with regard to this subject but there be no reason it may be say against matter of fact if it appear that the world be then more populous than at present we may be assure that our conjecture be false and that we have overlook some material circumstance in the comparison this readily own all our precede reason acknowledge to be mere trifle or at least small skirmish and frivolous rencounters which decide nothing but unluckily the main combat where we compare facts can not be render much more decisive the facts deliver by ancient author be either so uncertain or so imperfect as to afford us nothing positive in this matter how indeed could it be otherwise the very facts which we must oppose to them in compute the populousness of modern state be far from be either certain or complete many ground of calculation proceed on by celebrate writers be little better than those of the emperor heliogabalus who form an estimate of the immense greatness of rome from ten thousand pound weight of cobwebs which have be find in that city it be to be remark that all kinds of number be uncertain in ancient manuscripts and have be subject to much greater corruptions than any other part of the text and that for an obvious reason any alteration in other place commonly affect the sense or grammar and be more readily perceive by the reader and transcriber few enumerations of inhabitants have be make of any tract of country by any ancient author of good authority so as to afford us a large enough view for comparison it be probable that there be formerly a good foundation for the number of citizens assign to any free city because they enter for a share in the government and there be exact register keep of them but as the number of slave be seldom mention this leave us in as great uncertainty as ever with regard to the populousness even of single cities the first page of thucydides be in my opinion the commencement of real history all precede narrations be so intermix with fable that philosophers ought to abandon them in a great measure to the embellishment of poets and orators with regard to remote time the number of people assign be often ridiculous and lose all credit and authority the free citizens of sybaris able to bear arm and actually draw out in battle be they encounter at siagra with citizens of crotona another greek city contiguous to them and be defeat this be diodorus siculuss account and be very seriously insist on by that historian strabo also mention the same number of sybarites diodorus siculus enumerate the inhabitants of agrigentum when it be destroy by the carthaginians say that they amount to citizens strangers besides slave who in so opulent a city as he represent it would probably be at least as numerous we must remark that the women and the children be not include and that therefore upon the whole this city must have contain near two millions of inhabitants and what be the reason of so immense an encrease they be industrious in cultivate the neighbour field not exceed a small english county and they trade with their wine and oil to africa which at that time produce none of these commodities ptolemy say theocritus command cities suppose the singularity of the number be the reason of assign it diodorus siculus assign three millions of inhabitants to ægypt a small number but then he make the number of cities amount to an evident contradiction he say the people be formerly seven millions thus remote time be always most envy and admire that xerxess army be extremely numerous can readily believe both from the great extent of his empire and from the practice among the eastern nations of encumber their camp with a superfluous multitude but will any rational man cite herodotuss wonderful narrations as an authority there be something very rational own in lysiass argument upon this subject have not xerxess army be incredibly numerous say he he have never make a bridge over the hellespont it have be much easier to have transport his men over so short a passage with the numerous ship of which he be master polybius say that the romans between the first and second punic war be threaten with an invasion from the gauls muster all their own force and those of their ally and find them amount to seven hundred thousand men able to bear arm a great number surely and which when join to the slave be probablys not less if not rather more than that extent of country afford at present the enumeration too seem to have be make with some exactness and polybius give us the detail of the particulars but might not the number be magnify in order to encourage the people diodorus siculus make the same enumeration amount to near a million these variations be suspicious he plainly too suppose that italy in his time be not so populous another suspicious circumstance for who can believe that the inhabitants of that country diminish from the time of the first punic war to that of the triumvirates julius cæsar accord to appian encounter four millions of gauls kill one million and make another million prisoners suppose the number of the enemys army and that of the slay could be exactly assign which never be possible how could it be know how often the same man return into the armies or how distinguish the new from the old levy soldier no attention ought ever to be give to such loose exaggerate calculations especially where the author do not tell us the mediums upon which the calculations be found paterculus make the number of gauls kill by cæsar amount only to a more probable account and more easily reconcile to the history of these war give by that conqueror himself in his commentariesv the most bloody of his battle be fight against the helvetii and the germans one would imagine that every circumstance of the life and action of dionysius the elder might be regard as authentic and free from all fabulous exaggeration both because he live at a time when letter flourish most in greece and because his chief historian be philistus a man allow to be of great genius and who be a courtier and minister of that prince but can we admit that he have a stand army of foot horse and a fleet of gallies these we may observe be mercenary force and subsist upon pay like our armies in europe for the citizens be all disarm and when dion afterwards invade sicily and call on his countrymen to vindicate their liberty he be oblige to bring arm along with him which he distribute among those who join him in a state where agriculture alone flourish there may be many inhabitants and if these be all arm and discipline a great force may be call out upon occasion but great body of mercenary troop can never be maintain without either great trade and numerous manufacture or extensive dominions the unite provinces never be master of such a force by sea and land as that which be say to belong to dionysius yet they possess as large a territory perfectly well cultivate and have much more resources from their commerce and industry diodorus siculus allow that even in his time the army of dionysius appear incredible that be as interpret it be entirely a fiction and the opinion arise from the exaggerate flattery of the courtiers and perhaps from the vanity and policy of the tyrant himselfw it be a usual fallacy to consider all the age of antiquity as one period and to compute the number contain in the great cities mention by ancient author as if these cities have be all cotemporary the greek colonies flourish extremely in sicily during the age of alexander but in augustuss time they be so decay that almost all the produce of that fertile island be consume in italy let us now examine the number of inhabitants assign to particular cities in antiquity and omit the number of nineveh babylon and the egyptian thebes let us confine ourselves to the sphere of real history to the grecian and roman state must own the more consider this subject the more be incline to scepticism with regard to the great populousness ascribe to ancient time athens be say by plato to be a very great city and it be surely the greatest of all the greek cities except syracuse which be nearly about the same size in thucydidess time and afterwards encreased beyond it for cicero mention it as the greatest of all the greek cities in his time not comprehend suppose either antioch or alexandria under that denomination athenæus say that by the enumeration of demetrius phalereus there be in athens citizens strangers and slave this number be much insist on by those whose opinion call in question and be esteem a fundamental fact to their purpose but in my opinion there be no point of criticism more certain than that athenæus and ctesicles whom he quote be here mistake and that the number of slave be at least augment by a whole cypher and ought not to be regard as more than first when the number of citizens be say to be by athenæus men of full age be only understand for herodotus say that aristagoras ambassador from the ionians find it harder to deceive one spartan than athenians mean in a loose way the whole state suppose to be meet in one popular assembly exclude the women and children thucydides say that make allowance for all the absentees in the fleet army garrison and for people employ in their private affairs the athenian assembly never rise to five thousand the force enumerate by the same historian be all citizens and amount to heavyarmed infantry prove the same method of calculation as also the whole tenor of the greek historians who always understand men of full age when they assign the number of citizens in any republic now these be but the fourth of the inhabitants the free athenians be by this account the strangers and the slave calculate by the smaller number and allow that they marry and propagate at the same rate with freemen be and the whole of the inhabitants a number surely large enough the other number make athens larger than london and paris unite secondly there be but house in athens thirdly though the extent of the wall as give us by thucydides be great to wit eighteen miles beside the seacoast yet xenophon say there be much waste grind within the wall they seem indeed to have join four distinct and separate cities fourthly no insurrection of the slave or suspicion of insurrection be ever mention by historians except one commotion of the miners fifthly the treatment of slave by the athenians be say by xenophon and demosthenes and plautus to have be extremely gentle and indulgent which could never have be the case have the disproportion be twenty to one the disproportion be not so great in any of our colonies yet be we oblige to exercise a rigorous military government over the negroes sixthly no man be ever esteem rich for possess what may be reckon an equal distribution of property in any country or even triple or quadruple that wealth thus every person in england be compute by some to spend sixpence a day yet be he esteem but poor who have five time that sum now timarchus be say by æschines to have be leave in easy circumstances but he be master only of ten slave employ in manufacture lysias and his brother two strangers be proscribe by the thirty for their great riches though they have but sixty apiecedemosthenes be leave very rich by his father yet he have no more than fiftytwo slave his workhouse of twenty cabinetmakers be say to be a very considerable manufactory seventhly during the decelian war as the greek historians call it slave desert and bring the athenians to great distress as we learn from thucydides this could not have happen have they be only the twentieth part the best slave would not desert eighthlyxenophon propose a scheme for maintain by the public slave and that so great a number may possibly be support any one will be convince say he who consider the number we possess before the decelian war a way of speak altogether incompatible with the larger number of athenæus ninthly the whole census of the state of athens be less than talents and though number in ancient manuscripts be often suspect by critics yet this be unexceptionable both because demosthenes who give it give also the detail which check him and because polybius assign the same number and reason upon it now the most vulgar slave could yield by his labour an obolus a day over and above his maintenance as we learn from xenophon who say that niciass overseer pay his master so much for slave whom he employ inx mine if you will take the pain to estimate an obolus a day and the slave at compute only at four years purchase you will find the sum above talents even though allowance be make for the great number of holiday in athens besides many of the slave would have a much greater value from their art the lowest that demosthenes estimate any of his father slave be two minas a head and upon this supposition it be a little difficult confess to reconcile even the number of slave with the census of talents tenthlychios be say by thucydides to contain more slave than any greek city except sparta sparta then have more than athens in proportion to the number of citizens the spartans be in the town in the country the male slave therefore of full age must have be more than the whole more than a number impossible to be maintain in a narrow barren country such as laconia which have no trade have the helotes be so very numerous the murder of mention by thucydides would have irritate them without weaken them besides we be to consider that the number assign by athenæus whatever it be comprehend all the inhabitants of attica as well as those of athens the athenians affect much a country life as we learn from thucydides and when they be all chase into town by the invasion of their territory during the peloponnesian war the city be not able to contain them and they be oblige to lie in the porticoes temples and even streets for want of lodge the same remark be to be extend to all the other greek cities and when the number of citizens be assign we must always understand it to comprehend the inhabitants of the neighbour country as well as of the city yet even with this allowance it must be confess that greece be a populous country and exceed what we could imagine concern so narrow a territory naturally not very fertile and which draw no supply of corn from other place for except athens which trade to pontus for that commodity the other cities seem to have subsist chiefly from their neighbour territory rhodes be well know to have be a city of extensive commerce and of great fame and splendor yet it contain only citizens able to bear arm when it be besiege by demetrius thebes be always one of the capital cities of greece but the number of its citizens exceed not those of rhodesphliasia be say to be a small city by xenophon yet we find that it contain citizens pretend not to reconcile these two factsaa perhaps xenophon call phliasia a small town because it make but a small figure in greece and maintain only a subordinate alliance with sparta or perhaps the country belong to it be extensive and most of the citizens be employ in the cultivation of it and dwell in the neighbour villages mantinea be equal to any city in arcadia consequently it be equal to megalopolis which be fifty stadia or six miles and a quarter in circumference but mantinea have only citizens the greek cities therefore contain often field and garden together with the house and we can not judge of them by the extent of their wall athens contain no more than house yet its wall with the seacoast be above twenty miles in extent syracuse be twentytwo miles in circumference yet be scarcely ever speak of by the ancients as more populous than athens babylon be a square of fifteen miles or sixty miles in circuit but it contain large cultivate field and inclosures as we learn from pliny though aurelians wall be fifty miles in circumference the circuit of all the thirteen divisions of rome take apart accord to publius victor be only about fortythree miles when an enemy invade the country all the inhabitants retire within the wall of the ancient cities with their cattle and furniture and instrument of husbandry and the great height to which the wall be raise enable a small number to defend them with facility sparta say xenophon be one of the cities of greece that have the fewest inhabitants yet polybius say that it be fortyeight stadia in circumference and be round all the ætolians able to bear arm in antipaters time bb deduct some few garrison be but ten thousand men polybius tell us that the achæan league might without any inconvenience march or men and this account seem probable for that league comprehend the greater part of peloponnesus yet pausanias speak of the same period say that all the achæans able to bear arm even when several manumit slave be join to them do not amount to fifteen thousand the thessalians till their final conquest by the romans be in all age turbulent factious seditious disorderly it be not therefore natural to suppose that this part of greece abound much in people cc we be tell by thucydides that the part of peloponnesus adjoin to pylos be desart and uncultivated herodotus say that macedonia be full of lions and wild bull animals which can only inhabit vast unpeopled forest these be the two extremities of greece all the inhabitants of epirus of all age sex and condition who be sell by paulus æmilius amount only to yet epirus might be double the extent of yorkshiredd eejustin tell us that when philip of macedon be declare head of the greek confederacy he call a congress of all the state except the lacedemonians who refuse to concur and he find the force of the whole upon computation to amount to infantry and cavalry this must be understand to be all the citizens capable of bear arm for as the greek republics maintain no mercenary force and have no militia distinct from the whole body of the citizens it be not conceivable what other medium there could be of computation that such an army could ever by greece be bring into the field and be maintain there be contrary to all history upon this supposition therefore we may thus reason the free greeks of all age and sex be the slave estimate them by the number of athenian slave as above who seldom marry or have families be double the male citizens of full age to wit and all the inhabitants of ancient greece except laconia be about one million two hundred and ninety thousand no mighty number nor exceed what may be find at present in scotland a country of not much greater extent and very indifferently people we may now consider the number of people in rome and italy and collect all the light afford us by scatter passages in ancient author we shall find upon the whole a great difficulty in fix any opinion on that head and no reason to support those exaggerate calculations so much insist on by modern writers dionysius halicarnassæus say that the ancient wall of rome be nearly of the same compass with those of athens but that the suburbs run out to a great extent and it be difficult to tell where the town end or the country begin in some place of rome it appear from the same author from juvenal and from other ancient writers that the house be high and families live in separate storeys one above another but it be probable that these be only the poorer citizens and only in some few streets if we may judge from the younger plinys account of his own house and from bartolis plan of ancient build the men of quality have very spacious palaces and their build be like the chinese house at this day where each apartment be separate from the rest and rise no higher than a single storey to which if we add that the roman nobility much affect extensive porticoes and even woods in town we may perhaps allow vossius though there be no manner of reason for it to read the famous passage of the elder pliny his own way without admit the extravagant consequences which he draw from it the number of citizens who receive corn by the public distribution in the time of augustus be two hundred thousand this one would esteem a pretty certain grind of calculation yet be it attend with such circumstances as throw us back into doubt and uncertainty do the poorer citizens only receive the distribution it be calculate to be sure chiefly for their benefit but it appear from a passage in cicero that the rich might also take their portion and that it be esteem no reproach in them to apply for it to whom be the corn give whether only to head of families or to every man woman and child the portion every month be five modii to each about of a bushel this be too little for a family and too much for an individual a very accurate antiquary therefore infer that it be give to every man of full age but he allow the matter to be uncertain be it strictly enquire whether the claimant live within the precincts of rome or be it sufficient that he present himself at the monthly distribution this last seem more probable be there no false claimants we be tell that cæsar strike off at once who have creep in without a just title and it be very little probable that he remedied all abuse but lastly what proportion of slave must we assign to these citizens this be the most material question and the most uncertain it be very doubtful whether athens can be establish as a rule for rome perhaps the athenians have more slave because they employ them in manufacture for which a capital city like rome seem not so proper perhaps on the other hand the romans have more slave on account of their superior luxury and riches there be exact bill of mortality keep at rome but no ancient author have give us the number of burials except suetonius who tell us that in one season there be name carry to the temple of libitina but this be during a plague which can afford no certain foundation for any inference the public corn though distribute only to citizens affect very considerably the whole agriculture of italy a fact no wise reconcileable to some modern exaggerations with regard to the inhabitants of that country the best grind of conjecture can find concern the greatness of ancient rome be this we be tell by herodian that antioch and alexandria be very little inferior to rome it appear from diodorus siculus that one straight street of alexandria reach from gate to gate be five miles long and as alexandria be much more extend in length than breadth it seem to have be a city nearly of the bulk of paris and rome might be about the size of london there live in alexandria in diodorus siculuss time free people comprehend suppose women and children but what number of slave have we any just grind to fix these at an equal number with the free inhabitants it would favour the forego computation there be a passage in herodian which be a little surprise he say positively that the palace of the emperor be as large as all the rest of the city this be neros golden house which be indeed represent by suetonius and pliny as of an enormous extent but no power of imagination can make us conceive it to bear any proportion to such a city as london we may observe have the historian be relate neros extravagance and have he make use of such an expression it would have have much less weight these rhetorical exaggerations be so apt to creep into an author style even when the most chaste and correct but it be mention by herodian only by the by in relate the quarrel between geta and caracalla it appear from the same historian that there be then much land uncultivated and put to no manner of use and he ascribe it as a great praise to pertinax that he allow every one to take such land either in italy or elsewhere and cultivate it as he please without pay any tax land uncultivated and put to no manner of use this be not hear of in any part of christendom except in some remote part of hungary as have be inform and it surely correspond very ill with that idea of the extreme populousness of antiquity so much insist on we learn from vopiscus that there be even in etruria much fertile land uncultivated which the emperor aurelian intend to convert into vineyards in order to furnish the roman people with a gratuitous distribution of wine a very proper expedient for depopulate still farther that capital and all the neighbour territories it may not be amiss to take notice of the account which polybius give of the great herd of swine to be meet with in tuscany and lombardy as well as in greece and of the method of feed them which be then practise there be great herd of swine say he throughout all italy particularly in former time through etruria and cisalpine gaul and a herd frequently consist of a thousand or more swine when one of these herd in feed meet with another they mix together and the swineherds have no other expedient for separate them than to go to different quarter where they sound their horn and these animals be accustom to that signal run immediately each to the horn of his own keeper whereas in greece if the herd of swine happen to mix in the forest he who have the greater flock take cunningly the opportunity of drive all away and thieve be very apt to purloin the straggle hog which have wander to a great distance from their keeper in search of food may we not infer from this account that the north of italy as well as greece be then much less people and worse cultivate than at present how could these vast herd be feed in a country so full of inclosures so improve by agriculture so divide by farm so plant with vines and corn intermingle together must confess that polybiuss relation have more the air of that œconomy which be to be meet with in our american colonies than the management of a european country we meet with a reflection in aristotles ethics which seem unaccountable on any supposition and by prove too much in favour of our present reason may be think really to prove nothing that philosopher treat of friendship and observe that this relation ought neither to be contract to a very few nor extend over a great multitude illustrate his opinion by the follow argument in like manner say he as a city can not subsist if it either have so few inhabitants as ten or so many as a hundred thousand so be there a mediocrity require in the number of friends and you destroy the essence of friendship by run into either extreme what impossible that a city can contain a hundred thousand inhabitants have aristotle never see nor hear of a city so populous this must own pass my comprehension pliny tell us that seleucia the seat of the greek empire in the east be report to contain people carthage be say by strabo to have contain the inhabitants of pekin be not much more numerous london paris and constantinople may admit of nearly the same computation at least the two latter cities do not exceed it rome alexandria antioch we have already speak of from the experience of past and present age one might conjecture that there be a kind of impossibility that any city could ever rise much beyond this proportion whether the grandeur of a city be found on commerce or on empire there seem to be invincible obstacles which prevent its farther progress the seat of vast monarchies by introduce extravagant luxury irregular expence idleness dependence and false ideas of rank and superiority be improper for commerce extensive commerce check itself by raise the price of all labour and commodities when a great court engage the attendance of a numerous nobility possess of overgrow fortunes the middle gentry remain in their provincial towns where they can make a figure on a moderate income and if the dominions of a state arrive at an enormous size there necessarily arise many capitals in the remoter provinces whither all the inhabitants except a few courtiers repair for education fortune and amusementlondon by unite extensive commerce and middle empire have perhaps arrive at a greatness which no city will ever be able to exceed chuse dover or calais for a center draw a circle of two hundred miles radius you comprehend london paris the netherlands the unite provinces and some of the best cultivate part of france and england it may safely think be affirm that no spot of grind can be find in antiquity of equal extent which contain near so many great and populous cities and be so stock with riches and inhabitants to balance in both periods the state which possess most art knowledge civility and the best police seem the truest method of comparison it be an observation of labbe du bos that italy be warmer at present than it be in ancient time the annals of rome tell us say he that in the year ab uc the winter be so severe that it destroy the tree the tyber freeze in rome and the grind be cover with snow for forty days when juvenal describe a superstitious woman he represent her as break the ice of the tyber that she might perform her ablutions hybernum fracta glacie descendet in amnem ter matutino tyberi mergetur he speak of that rivers freeze as a common event many passages of horace suppose the streets of rome full of snow and ice we should have more certainty with regard to this point have the ancients know the use of thermometers but their writers without intend it give us information sufficient to convince us that the winter be now much more temperate at rome than formerly at present the tyber no more freeze at rome than the nile at cairo the romans esteem the winter very rigorous if the snow lie two days and if one see for eight and forty hours a few icicles hang from a fountain that have a north exposure the observation of this ingenious critic may be extend to other european climates who could discover the mild climate of france in diodorus siculuss description of that of gaul as it be a northern climate say he it be infest with cold to an extreme degree in cloudy weather instead of rain there fall great snow and in clear weather it there freeze so excessive hard that the rivers acquire bridge of their own substance over which not only single travellers may pass but large armies accompany with all their baggage and load waggons and there be many rivers in gaul the rhone the rhine c almost all of them be freeze over and it be usual in order to prevent fall to cover the ice with chaff and straw at the place where the road pass ffcolder than agallicwinter be use by petronius as a proverbial expression aristotle say that gaul be so cold a climate that an ass could not live in it north of the cevennes say strabogaul produce not figs and olives and the vines which have be plant bear not grapes that will ripen ovid positively maintain with all the serious affirmation of prose that the euxine sea be freeze over every winter in his time and he appeal to roman governours whom he name for the truth of his assertion this seldom or never happen at present in the latitude of tomi whither ovid be banish all the complaints of the same poet seem to mark a rigour of the season which be scarcely experience at present in petersburgh or stockholm tournefort a provençal who have travel into the same country observe that there be not a finer climate in the world and he assert that nothing but ovids melancholy could have give him such dismal ideas of it but the facts mention by that poet be too circumstantial to bear any such interpretation polybius say that the climate in arcadia be very cold and the air moist italy say varro be the most temperate climate in europe the inland part gaul germany and pannonia no doubt have almost perpetual winter the northern part of spain accord to strabo be but ill inhabit because of the great cold allow therefore this remark to be just that europe be become warmer than formerly how can we account for it plainly by no other method than by suppose that the land be at present much better cultivate and that the woods be clear which formerly throw a shade upon the earth and keep the ray of the sun from penetrate to it our northern colonies in america become more temperate in proportion as the woods be fell but in general every one may remark that cold be still much more severely felt both in north and south america than in place under the same latitude in europe saserna quote by columella affirm that the disposition of the heavens be alter before his time and that the air have become much milder and warmer as appear hence say he that many place now abound with vineyards and olive plantations which formerly by reason of the rigour of the climate could raise none of these productions such a change if real will be allow an evident sign of the better cultivation and people of countries before the age of saserna and if it be continue to the present time be a proof that these advantage have be continually encreasing throughout this part of the world let us now cast our eye over all the countries which be the scene of ancient and modern history and compare their past and present situation we shall not perhaps find such foundation for the complaint of the present emptiness and desolation of the world ægypt be represent by maillet to whom we owe the best account of it as extremely populous though he esteem the number of its inhabitants to be diminish syria and the lesser asia as well as the coast of barbary can readily own to be desart in comparison of their ancient condition the depopulation of greece be also obvious but whether the country now call turky in europe may not in general contain more inhabitants than during the flourish period of greece may be a little doubtful the thracians seem then to have live like the tartars at present by pasturage and plunder the get be still more uncivilized and the illyrians be no better these occupy ninetenths of that country and though the government of the turks be not very favourable to industry and propagation yet it preserve at least peace and order among the inhabitants and be preferable to that barbarous unsettle condition in which they anciently live poland and muscovy in europe be not populous but be certainly much more so than the ancient sarmatia and scythia where no husbandry or tillage be ever hear of and pasturage be the sole art by which the people be maintain the like observation may be extend to denmark and sweden no one ought to esteem the immense swarm of people which formerly come from the north and overrun all europe to be any objection to this opinion where a whole nation or even half of it remove their seat it be easy to imagine what a prodigious multitude they must form with what desperate valour they must make their attack and how the terror they strike into the invade nations will make these magnify in their imagination both the courage and multitude of the invaders scotland be neither extensive nor populous but be the half of its inhabitants to seek new seat they would form a colony as numerous as the teutons and cimbri and would shake all europe suppose it in no better condition for defence than formerly germany have surely at present twenty time more inhabitants than in ancient time when they cultivate no grind and each tribe value itself on the extensive desolation which it spread around as we learn from cæsar and tacitus and strabo a proof that the division into small republics will not alone render a nation populous unless attend with the spirit of peace order and industry the barbarous condition of britain in former time be well know and the thinness of its inhabitants may easily be conjecture both from their barbarity and from a circumstance mention by herodian that all britain be marshy even in severuss time after the romans have be fully settle in it above a century it be not easily imagine that the gauls be anciently much more advance in the arts of life than their northern neighbour since they travel to this island for their education in the mysteries of the religion and philosophy of the druids can not therefore think that gaul be then near so populous as france be at present be we to believe indeed and join together the testimony of appian and that of diodorus siculus we must admit of an incredible populousness in gaul the former historian say that there be nations in that country the latter affirm that the largest of the gallic nations consist of men besides women and children and the least of calculate therefore at a medium we must admit of near millions of people in a country which we esteem populous at present though suppose to contain little more than twenty such calculations therefore by their extravagance lose all manner of authority we may observe that the equality of property to which the populousness of antiquity may be ascribe have no place among the gauls their intestine war also before cæsars time be almost perpetual and strabo observe that though all gaul be cultivate yet be it not cultivate with any skill or care the genius of the inhabitants lead them less to arts than arm till their slavery under rome produce peace among themselves cæsar enumerate very particularly the great force which be levy in belgium to oppose his conquests and make them amount to these be not the whole people able to bear arm for the same historian tell us that the bellovaci could have bring a hundred thousand men into the field though they engage only for sixty take the whole therefore in this proportion of ten to six gg the sum of fight men in all the state of belgium be about all the inhabitants a million and a half and belgium be about a fourth of gaul that country might contain six millions which be nothh near the third of its present inhabitantsjj we be inform by cæsar that the gauls have no fix property in land but that the chieftains when any death happen in a family make a new division of all the land among the several members of the family this be the custom of tanistry which so long prevail in ireland and which retain that country in a state of misery barbarism and desolation the ancient helvetia be miles in length and in breadth accord to the same author yet contain only inhabitants the canton of berne alone have at present as many people after this computation of appian and diodorus siculus know not whether dare affirm that the modern dutch be more numerous than the ancient batavi spain be perhaps decay from what it be three centuries ago but if we step backward two thousand years and consider the restless turbulent unsettle condition of its inhabitants we may probably be incline to think that it be now much more populous many spaniards kill themselves when deprive of their arm by the romans it appear from plutarch that robbery and plunder be esteem honourable among the spaniards hirtius represent in the same light the situation of that country in cæsars time and he say that every man be oblige to live in castle and wall towns for his security it be not till its final conquest under augustus that these disorder be repress the account which strabo and justin give of spain correspond exactly with those above mention how much therefore must it diminish from our idea of the populousness of antiquity when we find that tully compare italy afric gaul greece and spain mention the great number of inhabitants as the peculiar circumstance which render this latter country formidable italy however it be probable have decay but how many great cities do it still contain venice genoa pavia turin milan naples florence leghorn which either subsist not in ancient time or be then very inconsiderable if we reflect on this we shall not be apt to carry matter to so great an extreme as be usual with regard to this subject when the roman author complain that italy which formerly export corn become dependent on all the provinces for its daily bread they never ascribe this alteration to the encrease of its inhabitants but to the neglect of tillage and agriculture a natural effect of that pernicious practice of import corn in order to distribute it gratis among the roman citizens and a very bad mean of multiply the inhabitants of any country the sportula so much talk of by martial and juvenal be present regularly make by the great lord to their smaller clients must have have a like tendency to produce idleness debauchery and a continual decay among the people the parishrates have at present the same bad consequences in england be to assign a period when imagine this part of the world might possibly contain more inhabitants than at present should pitch upon the age of trajan and the antonines the great extent of the roman empire be then civilize and cultivate settle almost in a profound peace both foreign and domestic and live under the same regular police and government but we be tell that all extensive governments especially absolute monarchies be pernicious to population and contain a secret vice and poison which destroy the effect of all these promise appearances to confirm this there be a passage cite from plutarch which be somewhat singular we shall here examine it that author endeavour to account for the silence of many of the oracles say that it may be ascribe to the present desolation of the world proceed from former war and factions which common calamity he add have fall heavier upon greece than on any other country insomuch that the whole could scarcely at present furnish three thousand warriors a number which in the time of the median war be supply by the single city of megara the gods therefore who affect work of dignity and importance have suppress many of their oracles and deign not to use so many interpreters of their will to so diminutive a people must confess that this passage contain so many difficulties that know not what to make of it you may observe that plutarch assign for a cause of the decay of mankind not the extensive dominion of the romans but the former war and factions of the several state all which be quiet by the roman arm plutarchs reason therefore be directly contrary to the inference which be draw from the fact he advance polybius suppose that greece have become more prosperous and flourish after the establishment of the roman yoke and though that historian write before these conquerors have degenerate from be the patrons to be the plunderers of mankind yet as we find from tacitus that the severity of the emperors afterwards correct the licence of the governors we have no reason to think that extensive monarchy so destructive as it be often represent we learn from strabo that the romans from their regard to the greeks maintain to his time most of the privilege and liberties of that celebrate nation and nero afterwards rather encreased them how therefore can we imagine that the roman yoke be so burdensome over that part of the world the oppression of the proconsuls be check and the magistracies in greece be all bestow in the several cities by the free vote of the people there be no necessity for the competitors to attend the emperors court if great number go to seek their fortunes in rome and advance themselves by learn or eloquence the commodities of their native country many of them would return with the fortunes which they have acquire and thereby enrich the grecian commonwealths but plutarch say that the general depopulation have be more sensibly felt in greece than in any other country how be this reconcileable to its superior privilege and advantage besides this passage by prove too much really prove nothing only three thousand men able to bear arm in allgreece who can admit so strange a proposition especially if we consider the great number of greek cities whose name still remain in history and which be mention by writers long after the age of plutarch there be there surely ten time more people at present when there scarcely remain a city in all the bound of ancient greece that country be still tolerably cultivate and furnish a sure supply of corn in case of any scarcity in spain italy or the south of france we may observe that the ancient frugality of the greeks and their equality of property still subsist during the age of plutarch as appear from lucian nor be there any grind to imagine that that country be possess by a few master and a great number of slave it be probable indeed that military discipline be entirely useless be extremely neglect in greece after the establishment of the roman empire and if these commonwealths formerly so warlike and ambitious maintain each of them a small cityguard to prevent mobbish disorder it be all they have occasion for and these perhaps do not amount to men throughout all greece own that if plutarch have this fact in his eye he be here guilty of a gross paralogism and assign cause no wise proportion to the effect but be it so great a prodigy that an author should fall into a mistake of this nature but whatever force may remain in this passage of plutarch we shall endeavour to counterbalance it by as remarkable a passage in diodorus siculus where the historian after mention ninuss army of foot and horse endeavour to support the credibility of this account by some posterior facts and add that we must not form a notion of the ancient populousness of mankind from the present emptiness and depopulation which be spread over the world thus an author who live at that very period of antiquity which be represent as most populous complain of the desolation which then prevail give the preference to former time and have recourse to ancient fables as a foundation for his opinion the humour of blame the present and admire the past be strongly root in human nature and have an influence even on persons endue with the profoundest judgment and most extensive learn essay of the original contract as no party in the present age can well support itself without a philosophical or speculative system of principles annex to its political or practical one we accordingly find that each of the factions into which this nation be divide have rear up a fabric of the former kind in order to protect and cover that scheme of action which it pursue the people be commonly very rude builders especially in this speculative way and more especially still when actuate by partyzeal it be natural to imagine that their workmanship must be a little unshapely and discover evident mark of that violence and hurry in which it be raise the one party by trace up government to the deity endeavour to render it so sacred and inviolate that it must be little less than sacrilege however tyrannical it may become to touch or invade it in the smallest article the other party by found government altogether on the consent of the people suppose that there be a kind of original contract by which the subject have tacitly reserve the power of resist their sovereign whenever they find themselves aggrieve by that authority with which they have for certain purpose voluntarily entrust him these be the speculative principles of the two party and these too be the practical consequences deduce from them shall venture to affirm that both these systems of speculative principles be just though not in the sense intend by the party and that both the scheme of practical consequences be prudent though not in the extremes to which each party in opposition to the other have commonly endeavour to carry them that the deity be the ultimate author of all government will never be deny by any who admit a general providence and allow that all events in the universe be conduct by an uniform plan and direct to wise purpose as it be impossible for the human race to subsist at least in any comfortable or secure state without the protection of government this institution must certainly have be intend by that beneficent be who mean the good of all his creatures and as it have universally in fact take place in all countries and all age we may conclude with still greater certainty that it be intend by that omniscient be who can never be deceive by any event or operation but since he give rise to it not by any particular or miraculous interposition but by his conceal and universal efficacy a sovereign can not properly speak be call his vicegerent in any other sense than every power or force be derive from him may be say to act by his commission whatever actually happen be comprehend in the general plan or intention of providence nor have the greatest and most lawful prince any more reason upon that account to plead a peculiar sacredness or inviolable authority than an inferior magistrate or even an usurper or even a robber and a pyrate the same divine superintendant who for wise purpose invest a a titus or a trajan with authority do also for purpose no doubt equally wise though unknown bestow power on a borgia or an angria the same cause which give rise to the sovereign power in every state establish likewise every petty jurisdiction in it and every limit authority a constable therefore no less than a king act by a divine commission and possess an indefeasible right when we consider how nearly equal all men be in their bodily force and even in their mental power and faculties till cultivate by education we must necessarily allow that nothing but their own consent could at first associate them together and subject them to any authority the people if we trace government to its first origin in the woods and desarts be the source of all power and jurisdiction and voluntarily for the sake of peace and order abandon their native liberty and receive laws from their equal and companion the condition upon which they be will to submit be either express or be so clear and obvious that it might well be esteem superfluous to express them if this then be mean by the original contract it can not be deny that all government be at first found on a contract and that the most ancient rude combinations of mankind be form chiefly by that principle in vain be we ask in what record this charter of our liberties be register it be not write on parchment nor yet on leave or bark of tree it precede the use of write and all the other civilize arts of life but we trace it plainly in the nature of man and in the equality b or something approach equality which we find in all the individuals of that species the force which now prevail and which be found on fleet and armies be plainly political and derive from authority the effect of establish government a man natural force consist only in the vigour of his limbs and the firmness of his courage which could never subject multitudes to the command of one nothing but their own consent and their sense of the advantage result from peace and order could have have that influence c yet even this consent be long very imperfect and could not be the basis of a regular administration the chieftain who have probably acquire his influence during the continuance of war rule more by persuasion than command and till he could employ force to reduce the refractory and disobedient the society could scarcely be say to have attain a state of civil government no compact or agreement it be evident be expressly form for general submission an idea far beyond the comprehension of savage each exertion of authority in the chieftain must have be particular and call forth by the present exigencies of the case the sensible utility result from his interposition make these exertions become daily more frequent and their frequency gradually produce an habitual and if you please to call it so a voluntary and therefore precarious acquiescence in the people but philosophers who have embrace a party if that be not a contradiction in term be not content with these concessions they assert not only that government in its earliest infancy arise from consent or rather the voluntary acquiescence of the people but also that even at present when it have attain full maturity it rest on no other foundation they affirm that all men be still bear equal and owe allegiance to no prince or government unless bind by the obligation and sanction of a promise and as no man without some equivalent would forego the advantage of his native liberty and subject himself to the will of another this promise be always understand to be conditional and impose on him no obligation unless he meet with justice and protection from his sovereign these advantage the sovereign promise him in return and if he fail in the execution he have break on his part the article of engagement and have thereby free his subject from all obligations to allegiance such accord to these philosophers be the foundation of authority in every government and such the right of resistance possess by every subject but would these reasoners look abroad into the world they would meet with nothing that in the least correspond to their ideas or can warrant so refine and philosophical a system on the contrary we find every where princes who claim their subject as their property and assert their independent right of sovereignty from conquest or succession we find also every where subject who acknowledge this right in their prince and suppose themselves bear under obligations of obedience to a certain sovereign as much as under the tie of reverence and duty to certain parent these connexions be always conceive to be equally independent of our consent in persia and china in france and spain and even in holland and england wherever the doctrines abovementioned have not be carefully inculcate obedience or subjection become so familiar that most men never make any enquiry about its origin or cause more than about the principle of gravity resistance or the most universal laws of nature or if curiosity ever move them as soon as they learn that they themselves and their ancestors have for several age or from time immemorial be subject to such a form of government or such a family they immediately acquiesce and acknowledge their obligation to allegiance be you to preach in most part of the world that political connexions be found altogether on voluntary consent or a mutual promise the magistrate would soon imprison you as seditious for loosen the tie of obedience if your friends do not before shut you up as delirious for advance such absurdities it be strange that an act of the mind which every individual be suppose to have form and after he come to the use of reason too otherwise it could have no authority that this act say should be so much unknown to all of them that over the face of the whole earth there scarcely remain any trace or memory of it but the contract on which government be found be say to be the original contract and consequently may be suppose too old to fall under the knowledge of the present generation if the agreement by which savage men first associate and conjoin their force be here mean this be acknowledge to be real but be so ancient and be obliterate by a thousand change of government and princes it can not now be suppose to retain any authority if we would say any thing to the purpose we must assert that every particular government which be lawful and which impose any duty of allegiance on the subject be at first found on consent and a voluntary compact but besides that this suppose the consent of the father to bind the children even to the most remote generations which republican writers will never allow besides this say it be not justify by history or experience in any age or country of the world almost all the governments which exist at present or of which there remain any record in story have be found originally either on usurpation or conquest or both without any pretence of a fair consent or voluntary subjection of the people when an artful and bold man be place at the head of an army or faction it be often easy for him by employ sometimes violence sometimes false pretences to establish his dominion over a people a hundred time more numerous than his partizans he allow no such open communication that his enemies can know with certainty their number or force he give them no leisure to assemble together in a body to oppose him even all those who be the instrument of his usurpation may wish his fall but their ignorance of each others intention keep them in awe and be the sole cause of his security by such arts as these many governments have be establish and this be all the original contract which they have to boast of the face of the earth be continually change by the encrease of small kingdoms into great empires by the dissolution of great empires into smaller kingdoms by the plant of colonies by the migration of tribes be there any thing discoverable in all these events but force and violence where be the mutual agreement or voluntary association so much talk of even the smoothest way by which a nation may receive a foreign master by marriage or a will be not extremely honourable for the people but suppose them to be dispose of like a dowry or a legacy accord to the pleasure or interest of their rulers but where no force interpose and election take place what be this election so highly vaunt it be either the combination of a few great men who decide for the whole and will allow of no opposition or it be the fury of a multitude that follow a seditious ringleader who be not know perhaps to a dozen among them and who owe his advancement merely to his own impudence or to the momentary caprice of his fellows be these disorderly elections which be rare too of such mighty authority as to be the only lawful foundation of all government and allegiance in reality there be not a more terrible event than a total dissolution of government which give liberty to the multitude and make the determination or choice of a new establishment depend upon a number which nearly approach to that of the body of the people for it never come entirely to the whole body of them every wise man then wish to see at the head of a powerful and obedient army a general who may speedily seize the prize and give to the people a master which they be so unfit to chuse for themselves so little correspondent be fact and reality to those philosophical notions let not the establishment at the revolution deceive us or make us so much in love with a philosophical origin to government as to imagine all others monstrous and irregular even that event be far from correspond to these refine ideas it be only the succession and that only in the regal part of the government which be then change and it be only the majority of seven hundred who determine that change for near ten millions doubt not indeed but the bulk of those ten millions acquiesce willingly in the determination but be the matter leave in the least to their choice be it not justly suppose to be from that moment decide and every man punish who refuse to submit to the new sovereign how otherwise could the matter have ever be bring to any issue or conclusion the republic of athens be believe the most extensive democracy that we read of in history yet if we make the requisite allowance for the women the slave and the strangers we shall find that that establishment be not at first make nor any law ever vote by a tenth part of those who be bind to pay obedience to it not to mention the islands and foreign dominions which the athenians claim as theirs by right of conquest and as it be well know that popular assemblies in that city be always full of licence and disorder notwithstanding the institutions and laws by which they be check how much more disorderly must they prove where they form not the establish constitution but meet tumultuously on the dissolution of the ancient government in order to give rise to a new one how chimerical must it be to talk of a choice in such circumstances d the achæans enjoy the freest and most perfect democracy of all antiquity yet they employ force to oblige some cities to enter into their league as we learn from polybius harry the ivth and harry the viith of england have really no title to the throne but a parliamentary election yet they never would acknowledge it lest they should thereby weaken their authority strange if the only real foundation of all authority be consent and promise it be in vain to say that all governments be or should be at first found on popular consent as much as the necessity of human affairs will admit this favour entirely my pretension maintain that human affairs will never admit of this consent seldom of the appearance of it but that conquest or usurpation that be in plain term force by dissolve the ancient governments be the origin of almost all the new ones which be ever establish in the world and that in the few case where consent may seem to have take place it be commonly so irregular so confine or so much intermix either with fraud or violence that it can not have any great authority e my intention here be not to exclude the consent of the people from be one just foundation of government where it have place it be surely the best and most sacred of any only pretend that it have very seldom have place in any degree and never almost in its full extent and that therefore some other foundation of government must also be admit be all men possess of so inflexible a regard to justice that of themselves they would totally abstain from the properties of others they have for ever remain in a state of absolute liberty without subjection to any magistrate or political society but this be a state of perfection of which human nature be justly deem incapable again be all men possess of so perfect an understand as always to know their own interest no form of government have ever be submit to but what be establish on consent and be fully canvass by every member of the society but this state of perfection be likewise much superior to human nature reason history and experience shew us that all political societies have have an origin much less accurate and regular and be one to choose a period of time when the people consent be the least regard in public transactions it would be precisely on the establishment of a new government in a settle constitution their inclinations be often consult but during the fury of revolutions conquests and public convulsions military force or political craft usually decide the controversy when a new government be establish by whatever mean the people be commonly dissatisfy with it and pay obedience more from fear and necessity than from any idea of allegiance or of moral obligation the prince be watchful and jealous and must carefully guard against every begin or appearance of insurrection time by degrees remove all these difficulties and accustom the nation to regard as their lawful or native princes that family which at first they consider as usurpers or foreign conquerors in order to find this opinion they have no recourse to any notion of voluntary consent or promise which they know never be in this case either expect or demand the original establishment be form by violence and submit to from necessity the subsequent administration be also support by power and acquiesce in by the people not as a matter of choice but of obligation they imagine not that their consent give their prince a title but they willingly consent because they think that from long possession he have acquire a title independent of their choice or inclination should it be say that by live under the dominion of a prince which one might leave every individual have give a tacit consent to his authority and promise him obedience it may be answer that such an imply consent can only have place where a man imagine that the matter depend on his choice but where he think as all mankind do who be bear under establish governments that by his birth he owe allegiance to a certain prince or certain form of government it would be absurd to infer a consent or choice which he expressly in this case renounce and disclaim can we seriously say that a poor peasant or artizan have a free choice to leave his country when he know no foreign language or manners and live from day to day by the small wag which he acquire we may as well assert that a man by remain in a vessel freely consent to the dominion of the master though he be carry on board while asleep and must leap into the ocean and perish the moment he leave her what if the prince forbid his subject to quit his dominions as in tiberiuss time it be regard as a crime in a roman knight that he have attempt to fly to the parthians in order to escape the tyranny of that emperor or as the ancient muscovites prohibit all travel under pain of death and do a prince observe that many of his subject be seize with the frenzy of migrate to foreign countries he would doubtless with great reason and justice restrain them in order to prevent the depopulation of his own kingdom would he forfeit the allegiance of all his subject by so wise and reasonable a law yet the freedom of their choice be surely in that case ravish from them a company of men who should leave their native country in order to people some uninhabited region might dream of recover their native freedom but they would soon find that their prince still lay claim to them and call them his subject even in their new settlement and in this he would but act conformably to the common ideas of mankind the truest tacit consent of this kind that be ever observe be when a foreigner settle in any country and be beforehand acquaint with the prince and government and laws to which he must submit yet be his allegiance though more voluntary much less expect or depend on than that of a natural bear subject on the contrary his native prince still assert a claim to him and if he punish not the renegade when he seize him in war with his new princes commission this clemency be not found on the municipal law which in all countries condemn the prisoner but on the consent of princes who have agree to this indulgence in order to prevent reprisals f do one generation of men go off the stage at once and another succeed as be the case with silkworms and butterfly the new race if they have sense enough to choose their government which surely be never the case with men might voluntarily and by general consent establish their own form of civil polity without any regard to the laws or precedents which prevail among their ancestors but as human society be in perpetual flux one man every hour go out of the world another come into it it be necessary in order to preserve stability in government that the new brood should conform themselves to the establish constitution and nearly follow the path which their father tread in the footsteps of theirs have mark out to them some innovations must necessarily have place in every human institution and it be happy where the enlighten genius of the age give these a direction to the side of reason liberty and justice but violent innovations no individual be entitle to make they be even dangerous to be attempt by the legislature more ill than good be ever to be expect from them and if history afford examples to the contrary they be not to be draw into precedent and be only to be regard as proof that the science of politics afford few rule which will not admit of some exception and which may not sometimes be controuled by fortune and accident the violent innovations in the reign of henry proceed from an imperious monarch second by the appearance of legislative authority those in the reign of charles be derive from faction and fanaticism and both of them have prove happy in the issue but even the former be long the source of many disorder and still more dangers and if the measure of allegiance be to be take from the latter a total anarchy must have place in human society and a final period at once be put to every government suppose that an usurper after have banish his lawful prince and royal family should establish his dominion for ten or a dozen years in any country and should preserve so exact a discipline in his troop and so regular a disposition in his garrison that no insurrection have ever be raise or even murmur hear against his administration can it be assert that the people who in their hearts abhor his treason have tacitly consent to his authority and promise him allegiance merely because from necessity they live under his dominion suppose again their native prince restore by mean of an army which he levy in foreign countries they receive him with joy and exultation and shew plainly with what reluctance they have submit to any other yoke may now ask upon what foundation the princes title stand not on popular consent surely for though the people willingly acquiesce in his authority they never imagine that their consent make him sovereign they consent because they apprehend him to be already by birth their lawful sovereign and as to that tacit consent which may now be infer from their live under his dominion this be no more than what they formerly give to the tyrant and usurper when we assert that all lawful government arise from the consent of the people we certainly do them a great deal more honour than they deserve or even expect and desire from us after the roman dominions become too unwieldly for the republic to govern them the people over the whole know world be extremely grateful to augustus for that authority which by violence he have establish over them and they shew an equal disposition to submit to the successor whom he leave them by his last will and testament it be afterwards their misfortune that there never be in one family any long regular succession but that their line of princes be continually break either by private assassinations or public rebellions the prætorian band on the failure of every family set up one emperor the legions in the east a second those in germany perhaps a third and the sword alone could decide the controversy the condition of the people in that mighty monarchy be to be lament not because the choice of the emperor be never leave to them for that be impracticable but because they never fell under any succession of master who might regularly follow each other as to the violence and war and bloodshed occasion by every new settlement these be not blameable because they be inevitable the house of lancaster rule in this island about sixty yearsg yet the partizans of the white rise seem daily to multiply in england the present establishment have take place during a still longer period have all view of right in another family be utterly extinguish even though scarce any man now alive have arrive at years of discretion when it be expel or could have consent to its dominion or have promise it allegiance a sufficient indication surely of the general sentiment of mankind on this head for we blame not the partizans of the abdicate family merely on account of the long time during which they have preserve their imaginary loyalty we blame them for adhere to a family which we affirm have be justly expel and which from the moment the new settlement take place have forfeit all title to authority but would we have a more regular at least a more philosophical refutation of this principle of an original contract or popular consent perhaps the follow observations may suffice all moral duties may be divide into two kinds the first be those to which men be impel by a natural instinct or immediate propensity which operate on them independent of all ideas of obligation and of all view either to public or private utility of this nature be love of children gratitude to benefactors pity to the unfortunate when we reflect on the advantage which result to society from such humane instincts we pay them the just tribute of moral approbation and esteem but the person actuate by them feel their power and influence antecedent to any such reflection the second kind of moral duties be such as be not support by any original instinct of nature but be perform entirely from a sense of obligation when we consider the necessities of human society and the impossibility of support it if these duties be neglect it be thus justice or a regard to the property of others fidelity or the observance of promise become obligatory and acquire an authority over mankind for as it be evident that every man love himself better than any other person he be naturally impel to extend his acquisitions as much as possible and nothing can restrain him in this propensity but reflection and experience by which he learn the pernicious effect of that licence and the total dissolution of society which must ensue from it his original inclination therefore or instinct be here check and restrain by a subsequent judgment or observation the case be precisely the same with the political or civil duty of allegiance as with the natural duties of justice and fidelity our primary instincts lead us either to indulge ourselves in unlimited freedom or to seek dominion over others and it be reflection only which engage us to sacrifice such strong passions to the interest of peace and public order a small degree of experience and observation suffice to teach us that society can not possibly be maintain without the authority of magistrates and that this authority must soon fall into contempt where exact obedience be not pay to it the observation of these general and obvious interest be the source of all allegiance and of that moral obligation which we attribute to it what necessity therefore be there to find the duty of allegiance or obedience to magistrates on that of fidelity or a regard to promise and to suppose that it be the consent of each individual which subject him to government when it appear that both allegiance and fidelity stand precisely on the same foundation and be both submit to by mankind on account of the apparent interest and necessities of human society we be bind to obey our sovereign it be say because we have give a tacit promise to that purpose but why be we bind to observe our promise it must here be assert that the commerce and intercourse of mankind which be of such mighty advantage can have no security where men pay no regard to their engagements in like manner may it be say that men could not live at all in society at least in a civilize society without laws and magistrates and judge to prevent the encroachments of the strong upon the weak of the violent upon the just and equitable the obligation to allegiance be of like force and authority with the obligation to fidelity we gain nothing by resolve the one into the other the general interest or necessities of society be sufficient to establish both if the reason be ask of that obedience which we be bind to pay to government readily answer because society could not otherwise subsist and this answer be clear and intelligible to all mankind your answer be because we should keep our word but besides that no body till train in a philosophical system can either comprehend or relish this answer besides this say you find yourself embarrass when it be ask why we be bind to keep our word nor can you give any answer but what would immediately without any circuit have account for our obligation to allegiance but to whom be allegiance due and who be our lawful sovereign this question be often the most difficult of any and liable to infinite discussions when people be so happy that they can answer our present sovereign who inherit in a direct line from ancestors that have govern us for many age this answer admit of no reply even though historians in trace up to the remotest antiquity the origin of that royal family may find as commonly happen that its first authority be derive from usurpation and violence it be confess that private justice or the abstinence from the properties of others be a most cardinal virtue yet reason tell us that there be no property in durable object such as land or house when carefully examine in pass from hand to hand but must in some period have be found on fraud and injustice the necessities of human society neither in private nor public life will allow of such an accurate enquiry and there be no virtue or moral duty but what may with facility be refine away if we indulge a false philosophy in sift and scrutinize it by every captious rule of logic in every light or position in which it may be place the question with regard to private property have fill infinite volumes of law and philosophy if in both we add the commentators to the original text and in the end we may safely pronounce that many of the rule there establish be uncertain ambiguous and arbitrary the like opinion may be form with regard to the succession and right of princes and form of governmenth several case no doubt occur especially in the infancy of any constitution which admit of no determination from the laws of justice and equity and our historian rapin pretendsi that the controversy between edward the third and philip de valois be of this nature and could be decide only by an appeal to heaven that be by war and violence who shall tell me whether germanicus or drusus ought to have succeed to tiberius have he die while they be both alive without name any of them for his successor ought the right of adoption to be receive as equivalent to that of blood in a nation where it have the same effect in private families and have already in two instance take place in the public ought germanicus to be esteem the elder son because he be bear before drusus or the younger because he be adopt after the birth of his brother ought the right of the elder to be regard in a nation where he have no advantage in the succession of private families ought the roman empire at that time to be deem hereditary because of two examples or ought it even so early to be regard as belong to the stronger or to the present possessor as be found on so recent an usurpation commodus mount the throne after a pretty long succession of excellent emperors who have acquire their title not by birth or public election but by the fictitious rite of adoption that bloody debauchee be murder by a conspiracy suddenly form between his wench and her gallant who happen at that time to be prætorian præfect these immediately deliberate about choose a master to human kind to speak in the style of those age and they cast their eye on pertinax before the tyrants death be know the præfect go secretly to that senator who on the appearance of the soldier imagine that his execution have be order by commodus he be immediately salute emperor by the officer and his attendants chearfully proclaim by the populace unwillingly submit to by the guard formally recognize by the senate and passively receive by the provinces and armies of the empire the discontent of the prætorian band break out in a sudden sedition which occasion the murder of that excellent prince and the world be now without a master and without government the guard think proper to set the empire formally to sale julian the purchaser be proclaim by the soldier recognize by the senate and submit to by the people and must also have be submit to by the provinces have not the envy of the legions beget opposition and resistance pescennius niger in syria elect himself emperor gain the tumultuary consent of his army and be attend with the secret goodwill of the senate and people of rome albinus in britain find an equal right to set up his claim but severus who govern pannonia prevail in the end above both of them that able politician and warrior find his own birth and dignity too much inferior to the imperial crown profess at first an intention only of revenge the death of pertinax he march as general into italy defeat julian and without our be able to fix any precise commencement even of the soldier consent he be from necessity acknowledge emperor by the senate and people and fully establish in his violent authority by subdue niger and albinus inter hæc gordianus cæsar say capitolinus speak of another period sublatus a militibus imperator est appellatus quia non erat alius in præsenti it be to be remark that gordian be a boy of fourteen years of age frequent instance of a like nature occur in the history of the emperors in that of alexanders successors and of many other countries nor can any thing be more unhappy than a despotic government of this kind where the succession be disjoint and irregular and must be determine on every vacancy by force or election in a free government the matter be often unavoidable and be also much less dangerous the interest of liberty may there frequently lead the people in their own defence to alter the succession of the crown and the constitution be compound of part may still maintain a sufficient stability by rest on the aristocratical or democratical members though the monarchical be alter from time to time in order to accommodate it to the former in an absolute government when there be no legal prince who have a title to the throne it may safely be determine to belong to the first occupant instance of this kind be but too frequent especially in the eastern monarchies j when any race of princes expire the will or destination of the last sovereign will be regard as a title thus the edict of lewis the xivth who call the bastard princes to the succession in case of the failure of all the legitimate princes would in such an event have some authorityk thus the will of charles the second dispose of the whole spanish monarchy the cession of the ancient proprietor especially when join to conquest be likewise deem a good title the general obligation which bind us to government be the interest and necessities of society and this obligation be very strong the determination of it to this or that particular prince or form of government be frequently more uncertain and dubious present possession have considerable authority in these case and greater than in private property because of the disorder which attend all revolutions and change of governmentl we shall only observe before we conclude that though an appeal to general opinion may justly in the speculative sciences of metaphysics natural philosophy or astronomy be deem unfair and inconclusive yet in all question with regard to morals as well as criticism there be really no other standard by which any controversy can ever be decide and nothing be a clearer proof that a theory of this kind be erroneous than to find that it lead to paradoxes repugnant to the common sentiments of mankind and to the practice and opinion of all nations and all age the doctrine which found all lawful government on an original contract or consent of the people be plainly of this kind nor have the most note of its partizans in prosecution of it scruple to affirm that absolute monarchy be inconsistent with civil society and so can be no form of civil government at all and that the supreme power in a state can not take from any man by tax and impositions any part of his property without his own consent or that of his representatives what authority any moral reason can have which lead into opinions so wide of the general practice of mankind in every place but this single kingdom it be easy to determinem the only passage meet with in antiquity where the obligation of obedience to government be ascribe to a promise be in platoscrito where socrates refuse to escape from prison because he have tacitly promise to obey the laws thus he build a tory consequence of passive obedience on a whig foundation of the original contract new discoveries be not to be expect in these matter if scarce any man till very lately ever imagine that government be found on compact it be certain that it can not in general have any such foundation the crime of rebellion among the ancients be commonly express by the term νεωτερίζειν novas res moliri essay of passive obedience in the former essay we endeavour to refute the speculative systems of politics advance in this nation as well the religious system of the one party as the philosophical of the other we come now to examine the practical consequences deduce by each party with regard to the measure of submission due to sovereigns as the obligation to justice be found entirely on the interest of society which require mutual abstinence from property in order to preserve peace among mankind it be evident that when the execution of justice would be attend with very pernicious consequences that virtue must be suspend and give place to public utility in such extraordinary and such press emergencies the maxim fiat justitia ruat cœlum let justice be perform though the universe be destroy be apparently false and by sacrifice the end to the mean shew a preposterous idea of the subordination of duties what governor of a town make any scruple of burn the suburbs when they facilitate the approach of the enemy or what general abstain from plunder a neutral country when the necessities of war require it and he can not otherwise subsist his army the case be the same with the duty of allegiance and common sense teach us that as government bind us to obedience only on account of its tendency to public utility that duty must always in extraordinary case when public ruin would evidently attend obedience yield to the primary and original obligation salus populi suprema lex the safety of the people be the supreme law this maxim be agreeable to the sentiments of mankind in all age nor be any one when he read of the insurrections against neroa or philip the second so infatuate with partysystems as not to wish success to the enterprize and praise the undertakers even our high monarchical party in spite of their sublime theory be force in such case to judge and feel and approve in conformity to the rest of mankind resistance therefore be admit in extraordinary emergencies the question can only be among good reasoners with regard to the degree of necessity which can justify resistance and render it lawful or commendable and here must confess that shall always incline to their side who draw the bond of allegiance very close and consider an infringement of it as the last refuge in desperate case when the public be in the highest danger from violence and tyranny for besides the mischiefs of a civil war which commonly attend insurrection it be certain that where a disposition to rebellion appear among any people it be one chief cause of tyranny in the rulers and force them into many violent measure which they never would have embrace have every one be incline to submission and obedience thus the tyrannicide or assassination approve of by ancient maxims instead of keep tyrants and usurpers in awe make them ten time more fierce and unrelenting and be now justly upon that account abolish by the laws of nations and universally condemn as a base and treacherous method of bring to justice these disturbers of society besides we must consider that as obedience be our duty in the common course of things it ought chiefly to be inculcate nor can any thing be more preposterous than an anxious care and solicitude in state all the case in which resistance may be allow in like manner though a philosopher reasonably acknowledge in the course of an argument that the rule of justice may be dispense with in case of urgent necessity what should we think of a preacher or casuist who should make it his chief study to find out such case and enforce them with all the vehemence of argument and eloquence would he not be better employ in inculcate the general doctrine than in display the particular exceptions which we be perhaps but too much incline of ourselves to embrace and to extend there be however two reason which may be plead in defence of that party among us who have with so much industry propagate the maxims of resistance maxims which it must be confess be in general so pernicious and so destructive of civil society the first be that their antagonists carry the doctrine of obedience to such an extravagant height as not only never to mention the exceptions in extraordinary case which might perhaps be excusable but even positively to exclude them it become necessary to insist on these exceptions and defend the right of injure truth and liberty the second and perhaps better reason be found on the nature of the british constitution and form of government it be almost peculiar to our constitution to establish a first magistrate with such high preeminence and dignity that though limit by the laws he be in a manner so far as regard his own person above the laws and can neither be question nor punish for any injury or wrong which may be commit by him his minister alone or those who act by his commission be obnoxious to justice and while the prince be thus allure by the prospect of personal safety to give the laws their free course an equal security be in effect obtain by the punishment of lesser offenders and at the same time a civil war be avoid which would be the infallible consequence be an attack at every turn make directly upon the sovereign but though the constitution pay this salutary compliment to the prince it can never reasonably be understand by that maxim to have determine its own destruction or to have establish a tame submission where he protect his minister persevere in injustice and usurp the whole power of the commonwealth this case indeed be never expressly put by the laws because it be impossible for them in their ordinary course to provide a remedy for it or establish any magistrate with superior authority to chastise the exorbitancies of the prince but as a right without a remedy would be an absurdity the remedy in this case be the extraordinary one of resistance when affairs come to that extremity that the constitution can be defend by it alone resistance therefore must of course become more frequent in the british government than in others which be simpler and consist of fewer part and movements where the king be an absolute sovereign he have little temptation to commit such enormous tyranny as may justly provoke rebellion but where he be limit his imprudent ambition without any great vices may run him into that perilous situation this be frequently suppose to have be the case with charles the first and if we may now speak truth after animosities be cease this be also the case with jam the second these be harmless if not in their private character good men but mistake the nature of our constitution and engross the whole legislative power it become necessary to oppose them with some vehemence and even to deprive the latter formally of that authority which he have use with such imprudence and indiscretion essay of the coalition of party to abolish all distinctions of party may not be practicable perhaps not desirable in a free government the only dangerous party be such as entertain opposite view with regard to the essentials of government the succession of the crown or the more considerable privilege belong to the several members of the constitution where there be no room for any compromise or accommodation and where the controversy may appear so momentous as to justify even an opposition by arm to the pretensions of antagonists of this nature be the animosity continue for above a century past between the party in england an animosity which break out sometimes into civil war which occasion violent revolutions and which continually endanger the peace and tranquillity of the nation but as there have appear of late the strongest symptoms of an universal desire to abolish these party distinctions this tendency to a coalition afford the most agreeable prospect of future happiness and ought to be carefully cherish and promote by every lover of his country there be not a more effectual method of promote so good an end than to prevent all unreasonable insult and triumph of the one party over the other to encourage moderate opinions to find the proper medium in all dispute to persuade each that its antagonist may possibly be sometimes in the right and to keep a balance in the praise and blame which we bestow on either side the two former essay concern the original contract and passive obedience be calculate for this purpose with regard to the philosophicala and practical controversies between the party and tend to show that neither side be in these respect so fully support by reason as they endeavour to flatter themselves we shall proceed to exercise the same moderation with regard to the historical dispute between the party by prove that each of them be justify by plausible topics that there be on both side wise men who mean well to their country and that the past animosity between the factions have no better foundation than narrow prejudice or interest passion the popular party who afterwards acquire the name of whigs might justify by very specious arguments that opposition to the crown from which our present free constitution be derive though oblige to acknowledge that precedents in favour of prerogative have uniformly take place during many reign before charles the first they think that there be no reason for submit any longer to so dangerous an authority such might have be their reason as the right of mankind be for ever to be deem sacred no prescription of tyranny or arbitrary power can have authority sufficient to abolish them liberty be a bless so inestimable that wherever there appear any probability of recover it a nation may willingly run many hazard and ought not even to repine at the greatest effusion of blood or dissipation of treasure all human institutions and none more than government be in continual fluctuation kings be sure to embrace every opportunity of extend their prerogatives and if favourable incidents be not also lay hold of for extend and secure the privilege of the people an universal despotism must for ever prevail amongst mankind the example of all the neighbour nations prove that it be no longer safe to entrust with the crown the same high prerogatives which have formerly be exercise during rude and simple age and though the example of many late reign may be plead in favour of a power in the prince somewhat arbitrary more remote reign afford instance of stricter limitations impose on the crown and those pretensions of the parliament now brand with the title of innovations be only a recovery of the just right of the people these view far from be odious be surely large and generous and noble to their prevalence and success the kingdom owe its liberty perhaps its learn its industry commerce and naval power by them chiefly the english name be distinguish among the society of nations and aspire to a rivalship with that of the freest and most illustrious commonwealths of antiquity but as all these mighty consequences could not reasonably be foresee at the time when the contest begin the royalists of that age want not specious arguments on their side by which they could justify their defence of the then establish prerogatives of the prince we shall state the question as it might have appear to them at the assemble of that parliament which by its violent encroachments on the crown begin the civil war the only rule of government they might have say know and acknowledge among men be use and practice reason be so uncertain a guide that it will always be expose to doubt and controversy could it ever render itself prevalent over the people men have always retain it as their sole rule of conduct they have still continue in the primitive unconnected state of nature without submit to political government whose sole basis be not pure reason but authority and precedent dissolve these tie you break all the bond of civil society and leave every man at liberty to consult his private interest by those expedients which his appetite disguise under the appearance of reason shall dictate to him the spirit of innovation be in itself pernicious however favourable its particular object may sometimes appear a truth so obvious that the popular party themselves be sensible of it and therefore cover their encroachments on the crown by the plausible pretence of their recover the ancient liberties of the people but the present prerogatives of the crown allow all the suppositions of that party have be incontestably establish ever since the accession of the house of tudor a period which as it now comprehend a hundred and sixty years may be allow sufficient to give stability to any constitution would it not have appear ridiculous in the reign of the emperor adrian to have talk of the republican constitution as the rule of government or to have suppose that the former right of the senate and consuls and tribunes be still subsist but the present claim of the english monarchs be much more favourable than those of the roman emperors during that age the authority of augustus be a plain usurpation ground only on military violence and form such an epoch in the roman history as be obvious to every reader but if henry really as some pretend enlarge the power of the crown it be only by insensible acquisitions which escape the apprehension of the people and have scarcely be remark even by historians and politicians the new government if it deserve the epithet be an imperceptible transition from the former be entirely engraft on it derive its title fully from that root and be to be consider only as one of those gradual revolutions to which human affairs in every nation will be for ever subject the house of tudor and after them that of stuart exercise no prerogatives but what have be claim and exercise by the plantagenets not a single branch of their authority can be say to be an innovation the only difference be that perhaps former kings exert these power only by intervals and be not able by reason of the opposition of their barons to render them so steady a rule of administrationb but the sole inference from this fact be that those ancient time be more turbulent and seditious and that royal authority the constitution and the laws have happily of late gain the ascendant under what pretence can the popular party now speak of recover the ancient constitution the former controul over the kings be not place in the commons but in the barons the people have no authority and even little or no liberty till the crown by suppress these factious tyrants enforce the execution of the laws and oblige all the subject equally to respect each others right privilege and properties if we must return to the ancient barbarous and c feudal constitution let those gentlemen who now behave themselves with so much insolence to their sovereign set the first example let them make court to be admit as retainers to a neighbour baron and by submit to slavery under him acquire some protection to themselves together with the power of exercise rapine and oppression over their inferior slave and villains this be the condition of the commons among their remote ancestors but how far back must we go in have recourse to ancient constitutions and governments there be a constitution still more ancient than that to which these innovators affect so much to appeal during that period there be no magna charta the barons themselves possess few regular state privilege and the house of commons probably have not an existence it be ridiculous to hear the commons while they be assume by usurpation the whole power of government talk of revive ancient institutions be it not know that though representatives receive wag from their constituents to be a member of the lower house be always consider as a burden and an exemption from it as a privilege will they persuade us that power which of all human acquisitions be the most covet and in comparison of which even reputation and pleasure and riches be slight could ever be regard as a burden by any man the property acquire of late by the commons it be say entitle them to more power than their ancestors enjoy but to what be this encrease of their property owe but to an encrease of their liberty and their security let them therefore acknowledge that their ancestors while the crown be restrain by the seditious barons really enjoy less liberty than they themselves have attain after the sovereign acquire the ascendant and let them enjoy that liberty with moderation and not forfeit it by new exorbitant claim and by render it a pretence for endless innovations the true rule of government be the present establish practice of the age that have most authority because it be recent it be also best know for the same reason who have assure those tribunes that the plantagenets do not exercise as high act of authority as the tudors historians they say do not mention them but historians be also silent with regard to the chief exertions of prerogative by the tudors where any power or prerogative be fully and undoubtedly establish the exercise of it pass for a thing of course and readily escape the notice of history and annals have we no other monuments of elizabeths reign than what be preserve even by camden the most copious judicious and exact of our historians we should be entirely ignorant of the most important maxims of her government be not the present monarchical government in its full extent authorize by lawyers recommend by divine acknowledge by politicians acquiesce in nay passionately cherish by the people in general and all this during a period of at least a hundred and sixty years and till of late without the smallest murmur or controversy this general consent surely during so long a time must be sufficient to render a constitution legal and valid if the origin of all power be derive as be pretend from the people here be their consent in the fullest and most ample term that can be desire or imagine but the people must not pretend because they can by their consent lay the foundations of government that therefore they be to be permit at their pleasure to overthrow and subvert them there be no end of these seditious and arrogant claim the power of the crown be now openly strike at the nobility be also in visible peril the gentry will soon follow the popular leaders who will then assume the name of gentry will next be expose to danger and the people themselves have become incapable of civil government and lie under the restraint of no authority must for the sake of peace admit instead of their legal and mild monarchs a succession of military and despotic tyrants these consequences be the more to be dread as the present fury of the people though gloss over by pretensions to civil liberty be in reality incite by the fanaticism of religion a principle the most blind headstrong and ungovernable by which human nature can possibly be actuate popular rage be dreadful from whatever motive derive but must be attend with the most pernicious consequences when it arise from a principle which disclaim all controul by human law reason or authority these be the arguments which each party may make use of to justify the conduct of their predecessors during that great crisis the event if that can be admit as a reason have show that the arguments of the popular party be better found but perhaps accord to the establish maxims of lawyers and politicians the view of the royalists ought beforehand to have appear more solid more safe and more legal but this be certain that the greater moderation we now employ in represent past events the nearer shall we be to produce a full coalition of the party and an entire acquiescence in our present establishment moderation be of advantage to every establishment nothing but zeal can overturn a settle power and an overactive zeal in friends be apt to beget a like spirit in antagonists the transition from a moderate opposition against an establishment to an entire acquiescence in it be easy and insensible there be many invincible arguments which should induce the malcontent party to acquiesce entirely in the present settlement of the constitution they now find that the spirit of civil liberty though at first connect with religious fanaticism could purge itself from that pollution and appear under a more genuine and engage aspect a friend to toleration and an encourager of all the enlarge and generous sentiments that do honour to human nature they may observe that the popular claim could stop at a proper period and after retrench the high claim of prerogative could still maintain a due respect to monarchy to nobility and to all ancient institutions above all they must be sensible that the very principle which make the strength of their party and from which it derive its chief authority have now desert them and go over to their antagonists the plan of liberty be settle its happy effect be prove by experience a long tract of time have give it stability and whoever would attempt to overturn it and to recall the past government or abdicate family would besides other more criminal imputations be expose in their turn to the reproach of faction and innovation while they peruse the history of past events they ought to reflect both that those right of the crown be long since annihilate and that the tyranny and violence and oppression to which they often give rise be ills from which the establish liberty of the constitution have now at last happily protect the people these reflections will prove a better security to our freedom and privilege than to deny contrary to the clearest evidence of facts that such regal power ever have an existence there be not a more effectual method of betray a cause than to lay the stress of the argument on a wrong place and by dispute an untenable post enure the adversaries to success and victory essay of the protestant succession suppose that a member of parliament in the reign of king william or queen anne while the establishment of the protestant succession be yet uncertain be deliberate concern the party he would chuse in that important question and weigh with impartiality the advantage and disadvantage on each side believe the follow particulars would have enter into his consideration he would easily perceive the great advantage result from the restoration of the stuart family by which we should preserve the succession clear and undisputed free from a pretender with such a specious title as that of blood which with the multitude be always the claim the strongest and most easily comprehend it be in vain to say as many have do that the question with regard to governors independent of government be frivolous and little worth dispute much less fight about the generality of mankind never will enter into these sentiments and it be much happier believe for society that they do not but rather continue in their natural prepossessions how could stability be preserve in any monarchical government which though perhaps not the best be and always have be the most common of any unless men have so passionate a regard for the true heir of their royal family and even though he be weak in understand or infirm in years give him so sensible a preference above persons the most accomplish in shin talents or celebrate for great atchievements would not every popular leader put in his claim at every vacancy or even without any vacancy and the kingdom become the theatre of perpetual war and convulsions the condition of the roman empire surely be not in this respect much to be envy nor be that of the eastern nations who pay little regard to the title of their sovereign but sacrifice them every day to the caprice or momentary humour of the populace or soldiery it be but a foolish wisdom which be so carefully display in undervalue princes and place them on a level with the meanest of mankind to be sure an anatomist find no more in the greatest monarch than in the lowest peasant or daylabourer and a moralist may perhaps frequently find less but what do all these reflections tend to we all of us still retain these prejudice in favour of birth and family and neither in our serious occupations nor most careless amusements can we ever get entirely rid of them a tragedy that should represent the adventure of sailors or porter or even of private gentlemen would presently disgust us but one that introduce kings and princes acquire in our eye an air of importance and dignity or should a man be able by his superior wisdom to get entirely above such prepossessions he would soon by mean of the same wisdom again bring himself down to them for the sake of society whose welfare he would perceive to be intimately connect with them far from endeavour to undeceive the people in this particular he would cherish such sentiments of reverence to their princes as requisite to preserve a due subordination in society and though the live of twenty thousand men be often sacrifice to maintain a king in possession of his throne or preserve the right of succession undisturbed he entertain no indignation at the loss on pretence that every individual of these be perhaps in himself as valuable as the prince he serve he consider the consequences of violate the hereditary right of kings consequences which may be felt for many centuries while the loss of several thousand men bring so little prejudice to a large kingdom that it may not be perceive a few years after the advantage of the hanover succession be of an opposite nature and arise from this very circumstance that it violate hereditary right and place on the throne a prince to whom birth give no title to that dignity it be evident from the history of this island that the privilege of the people have during near two centuries be continually upon the encrease by the division of the churchlands by the alienations of the barons estates by the progress of trade and above all by the happiness of our situation which for a long time give us sufficient security without any stand army or military establishment on the contrary public liberty have almost in every other nation of europe be during the same period extremely upon the decline while the people be disgust at the hardships of the old a feudal militia and rather choose to entrust their prince with mercenary armies which he easily turn against themselves it be nothing extraordinary therefore that some of our british sovereigns mistake the nature of the constitution at least the genius of the people and as they embrace all the favourable precedents leave them by their ancestors they overlook all those which be contrary and which suppose a limitation in our government they be encourage in this mistake by the example of all the neighbour princes who bear the same title or appellation and be adorn with the same ensigns of authority naturally lead them to claim the same power and prerogatives b it appear from the speeches and proclamations of jam and the whole train of that princes action as well as his sons that he regard the english government as a simple monarchy and never imagine that any considerable part of his subject entertain a contrary idea this opinion make those monarchs discover their pretensions without prepare any force to support them and even without reserve or disguise which be always employ by those who enter upon any new project or endeavour to innovate in any government the flattery of courtiers farther c confirm their prejudice and above all that of the clergy who from several passages of scripture and these wrest too have erect a regular and avow system of arbitrary power the only method of destroy at once all these high claim and pretensions be to depart from the true hereditary line and choose a prince who be plainly a creature of the public and receive the crown on condition express and avow find his authority establish on the same bottom with the privilege of the people by elect him in the royal line we cut off all hop of ambitious subject who might in future emergencies disturb the government by their cabal and pretensions by render the crown hereditary in his family we avoid all the inconveniencies of elective monarchy and by exclude the lineal heir we secure all our constitutional limitations and render our government uniform and of a piece the people cherish monarchy because protect by it the monarch favour liberty because create by it and thus every advantage be obtain by the new establishment as far as human skill and wisdom can extend itself these be the separate advantage of fix the succession either in the house of stuart or in that of hanover there be also disadvantage in each establishment which an impartial patriot would ponder and examine in order to form a just judgment upon the whole the disadvantage of the protestant succession consist in the foreign dominions which be possess by the princes of the hanover line and which it might be suppose would engage us in the intrigue and war of the continent and lose us in some measure the inestimable advantage we possess of be surround and guard by the sea which we command the disadvantage of recall the abdicate family consist chiefly in their religion which be more prejudicial to society than that establish amongst us be contrary to it and afford no toleration or peace or security to any other communion it appear to me that these advantage and disadvantage be allow on both side at least by every one who be at all susceptible of argument or reason no subject however loyal pretend to deny that the dispute title and foreign dominions of the present royal family be a loss nor be there any partizan of the stuarts but will confess that the claim of hereditary indefeasible right and the roman catholic religion be also disadvantage in that family it belong therefore to a philosopher alone who be of neither party to put all the circumstances in the scale and assign to each of them its proper poise and influence such a one will readily at first acknowledge that all political question be infinitely complicate and that there scarcely ever occur in any deliberation a choice which be either purely good or purely ill consequences mix and vary may be foresee to flow from every measure and many consequences unforeseen do always in fact result from every one hesitation and reserve and suspence be therefore the only sentiments he bring to this essay or trial or if he indulge any passion it be that of derision against the ignorant multitude who be always clamorous and dogmatical even in the nicest question of which from want of temper perhaps still more than of understand they be altogether unfit judge but to say something more determinate on this head the follow reflections will hope show the temper if not the understand of a philosopher be we to judge merely by first appearances and by past experience we must allow that the advantage of a parliamentary title in the house of hanover be greater than those of an undisputed hereditary title in the house of stuart and that our father act wisely in prefer the former to the latter so long as the house of stuart rule in great britain which with some interruption be above eighty years the government be keep in a continual fever by the contention between the privilege of the people and the prerogatives of the crown if arm be drop the noise of dispute continue or if these be silence jealousy still corrode the heart and throw the nation into an unnatural ferment and disorder and while we be thus occupy in domestic dispute a foreign power dangerous to public liberty erect itself in europe without any opposition from us and even sometimes with our assistance but during these last sixty years when a parliamentary establishment have take place whatever factions may have prevail either among the people or in public assemblies the whole force of our constitution have always fall to one side and an uninterrupted harmony have be preserve between our princes and our parliaments public liberty with internal peace and order have flourish almost without interruption trade and manufacture and agriculture have encreased the arts and sciences and philosophy have be cultivate even religious party have be necessitate to lay aside their mutual rancour and the glory of the nation have spread itself all over europed derive equally from our progress in the arts of peace and from valour and success in war so long and so glorious a period no nation almost can boast of nor be there another instance in the whole history of mankind that so many millions of people have during such a space of time be hold together in a manner so free so rational and so suitable to the dignity of human nature but though this recent experience seem clearly to decide in favour of the present establishment there be some circumstances to be throw into the other scale and it be dangerous to regulate our judgment by one event or example we have have two rebellions during the flourish period above mention besides plot and conspiracies without number and if none of these have produce any very fatal event we may ascribe our escape chiefly to the narrow genius of those princes who dispute our establishment and we may esteem ourselves so far fortunate but the claim of the banish family fear be not yet antiquate and who can foretel that their future attempt will produce no greater disorder the dispute between privilege and prerogative may easily be compose by laws and vote and conferences and concessions where there be tolerable temper or prudence on both side or on either side among contend title the question can only be determine by the sword and by devastation and by civil war a prince who fill the throne with a dispute title dare not arm his subject the only method of secure a people fully both against domestic oppression and foreign conquest notwithstanding our riches and renown what a critical escape do we make by the late peace from dangers which be owe not so much to bad conduct and ill success in war as to the pernicious practice of mortgage our finance and the still more pernicious maxim of never pay off our incumbrances such fatal measure would not probably have be embrace have it not be to secure a precarious establishmente but to convince us that an hereditary title be to be embrace rather than a parliamentary one which be not support by any other view or motives a man need only transport himself back to the æra of the restoration and suppose that he have have a seat in that parliament which recall the royal family and put a period to the greatest disorder that ever arise from the opposite pretensions of prince and people what would have be think of one that have propose at that time to set aside charles and settle the crown on the duke of york or gloucester merely in order to exclude all high claim like those of their father and grandfather would not such a one have be regard as an extravagant projector who love dangerous remedy and could tamper and play with a government and national constitution like a quack with a sickly patientf in reality the reason assign by the nation for exclude the race of stuart and so many other branch of the royal family be not on account of their hereditary title a reason which would to vulgar apprehensions have appear altogether absurd but on account of their religion which lead us to compare the disadvantage above mention in each establishment confess that consider the matter in general it be much to be wish that our prince have no foreign dominions and could confine all his attention to the government of this island for not to mention some real inconveniencies that may result from territories on the continent they afford such a handle for calumny and defamation as be greedily seize by the people always dispose to think ill of their superiors it must however be acknowledge that hanover be perhaps the spot of grind in europe the least inconvenient for a king of england it lie in the heart of germany at a distance from the great power which be our natural rival it be protect by the laws of the empire as well as by the arm of its own sovereign and it serve only to connect us more closely with the house of austria our natural allyg the religious persuasion of the house of stuart be an inconvenience of a much deeper dye and would threaten us with much more dismal consequences the roman catholic religion with its train of priests and friers be more expensive than ours even though unaccompanied with its natural attendants of inquisitors and stake and gibbet it be less tolerate and not content with divide the sacerdotal from the regal office which must be prejudicial to any state it bestow the former on a foreigner who have always a separate interest from that of the public and may often have an opposite one but be this religion ever so advantageous to society it be contrary to that which be establish among us and which be likely to keep possession for a long time of the mind of the people and though it be much to be hop that the progress of reason will by degrees abate the h acrimony of opposite religions all over europe yet the spirit of moderation have as yet make too slow advance to be entirely trustedi thus upon the whole the advantage of the settlement in the family of stuart which free us from a dispute title seem to bear some proportion with those of the settlement in the family of hanover which free us from the claim of prerogative but at the same time its disadvantage by place on the throne a roman catholic be greater than those of the other establishment in settle the crown on a foreign prince what party an impartial patriot in the reign of k william or q anne would have choose amidst these opposite view may perhaps to some appear hard to determinej but the settlement in the house of hanover have actually take place the princes of that family without intrigue without cabal without solicitation on their part have be call to mount our throne by the unite voice of the whole legislative body they have since their accession display in all their action the utmost mildness equity and regard to the laws and constitution our own minister our own parliaments ourselves have govern us and if aught ill have befall us we can only blame fortune or ourselves what a reproach must we become among nations if disgust with a settlement so deliberately make and whose condition have be so religiously observe we should throw every thing again into confusion and by our levity and rebellious disposition prove ourselves totally unfit for any state but that of absolute slavery and subjection the greatest inconvenience attend a dispute title be that it bring us in danger of civil war and rebellions what wise man to avoid this inconvenience would run directly into a civil war and rebellion not to mention that so long possession secure by so many laws must ere this time in the apprehension of a great part of the nation have beget a title in the house of hanover independent of their present possession so that now we should not even by a revolution obtain the end of avoid a dispute title no revolution make by national force will ever be able without some other great necessity to abolish our debts and incumbrances in which the interest of so many persons be concern and a revolution make by foreign force be a conquest a calamity with which the precarious balance of power threaten us and which our civil dissentions be likely above all other circumstances to bring upon us essay idea of a perfect commonwealth it be not with form of government as with other artificial contrivances where an old engine may be reject if we can discover another more accurate and commodious or where trials may safely be make even though the success be doubtful an establish government have an infinite advantage by that very circumstance of its be establish the bulk of mankind be govern by authority not reason and never attribute authority to any thing that have not the recommendation of antiquity to tamper therefore in this affair or try experiment merely upon the credit of suppose argument and philosophy can never be the part of a wise magistrate who will bear a reverence to what carry the mark of age and though he may attempt some improvements for the public good yet will he adjust his innovations as much as possible to the ancient fabric and preserve entire the chief pillars and support of the constitution the mathematicians in europe have be much divide concern that figure of a ship which be the most commodious for sail and huygens who at last determine the controversy be justly think to have oblige the learn as well as commercial world though columbus have sail to america and sir francis drake make the tour of the world without any such discovery as one form of government must be allow more perfect than another independent of the manners and humour of particular men why may we not enquire what be the most perfect of all though the common botch and inaccurate governments seem to serve the purpose of society and though it be not so easy to establish a new system of government as to build a vessel upon a new construction the subject be surely the most worthy curiosity of any the wit of man can possibly devise and who know if this controversy be fix by the universal consent of the wise and learn but in some future age an opportunity might be afford of reduce the theory to practice either by a dissolution of some old government or by the combination of men to form a new one in some distant part of the world in all case it must be advantageous to know what be most perfect in the kind that we may be able to bring any real constitution or form of government as near it as possible by such gentle alterations and innovations as may not give too great disturbance to society all pretend to in the present essay be to revive this subject of speculation and therefore shall deliver my sentiments in as few word as possible a long dissertation on that head would not apprehend be very acceptable to the public who will be apt to regard such disquisitions both as useless and chimerical all plan of government which suppose great reformation in the manners of mankind be plainly imaginary of this nature be the republic of plato and the utopia of sir thomas more the oceana be the only valuable model of a commonwealth that have yet be offer to the public the chief defect of the oceana seem to be these first its rotation be inconvenient by throw men of whatever abilities by intervals out of public employments secondly its agrarian be impracticable men will soon learn the art which be practise in ancient rome of conceal their possessions under other people name till at last the abuse will become so common that they will throw off even the appearance of restraint thirdly the oceana provide not a sufficient security for liberty or the redress of grievances the senate must propose and the people consent by which mean the senate have not only a negative upon the people but what be of much greater consequence their negative go before the vote of the people be the kings negative of the same nature in the english constitution and could he prevent any bill from come into parliament he would be an absolute monarch as his negative follow the vote of the house it be of little consequence such a difference be there in the manner of place the same thing when a popular bill have be debate in parliament be bring to maturity all its conveniencies and inconveniencies weigh and balance if afterwards it be present for the royal assent few princes will venture to reject the unanimous desire of the people but could the king crush a disagreeable bill in embryo as be the case for some time in the scottish parliament by mean of the lord of the article the british government would have no balance nor would grievances ever be redress and it be certain that exorbitant power proceed not in any government from new laws so much as from neglect to remedy the abuse which frequently rise from the old ones a government say machiavel must often be bring back to its original principles it appear then that in the oceana the whole legislature may be say to rest in the senate which harrington would own to be an inconvenient form of government especially after the agrarian be abolish here be a form of government to which can not in theory discover any considerable objection a let great britain and ireland or any territory of equal extent be divide into counties and each county into parishes make in all if the country propose to be erect into a commonwealth be of more narrow extent we may diminish the number of counties but never bring them below thirty if it be of greater extent it be better to enlarge the parishes or throw more parishes into a county than encrease the number of counties b let all the freeholders of twenty pound ayear in the county and all the householders worth pound in the town parishes meet annually in the parish church and chuse by ballot some freeholder of the county for their member whom we shall call the county representative let the county representatives two days after their election meet in the county town and chuse by ballot from their own body ten county magistrates and one senator there be therefore in the whole commonwealth senators county magistrates and county representatives for we shall bestow on all senators the authority of county magistrates and on all county magistrates the authority of county representatives let the senators meet in the capital and be endow with the whole executive power of the commonwealth the power of peace and war of give order to general admirals and ambassadors and in short all the prerogatives of a british king except his negative let the county representatives meet in their particular counties and possess the whole legislative power of the commonwealth the greater number of counties decide the question and where these be equal let the senate have the cast vote every new law must first be debate in the senate and though reject by it if ten senators insist and protest it must be send down to the counties the senate if they please may join to the copy of the law their reason for receive or reject it because it would be troublesome to assemble all the county representatives for every trivial law that may be requisite the senate have their choice of send down the law either to the county magistrates or county representatives the magistrates though the law be refer to them may if they please call the representatives and submit the affair to their determination whether the law be refer by the senate to the county magistrates or representatives a copy of it and of the senates reason must be send to every representative eight days before the day appoint for the assemble in order to deliberate concern it and though the determination be by the senate refer to the magistrates if five representatives of the county order the magistrates to assemble the whole court of representatives and submit the affair to their determination they must obey either the county magistrates or representatives may give to the senator of the county the copy of a law to be propose to the senate and if five counties concur in the same order the law though refuse by the senate must come either to the county magistrates or representatives as be contain in the order of the five counties any twenty counties by a vote either of their magistrates or representatives may throw any man out of all public offices for a year thirty counties for three years the senate have a power of throw out any member or number of members of its own body not to be reelect for that year the senate can not throw out twice in a year the senator of the same county the power of the old senate continue for three weeks after the annual election of the county representatives then all the new senators be shut up in a conclave like the cardinals and by an intricate ballot such as that of venice or malta they chuse the follow magistrates a protector who represent the dignity of the commonwealth and preside in the senate two secretaries of state these six councils a council of state a council of religion and learn a council of trade a council of laws a council of war a council of the admiralty each council consist of five persons together with six commissioners of the treasury and a first commissioner all these must be senators the senate also name all the ambassadors to foreign court who may either be senators or not the senate may continue any or all of these but must reelect them every year the protector and two secretaries have session and suffrage in the council of state the business of that council be all foreign politics the council of state have session and suffrage in all the other councils the council of religion and learn inspect the universities and clergy that of trade inspect every thing that may affect commerce that of laws inspect all the abuse of law by the inferior magistrates and examine what improvements may be make of the municipal law that of war inspect the militia and its discipline magazines store c and when the republic be in war examine into the proper order for general the council of admiralty have the same power with regard to the navy together with the nomination of the captain and all inferior officer none of these councils can give order themselves except where they receive such power from the senate in other case they must communicate every thing to the senate when the senate be under adjournment any of the councils may assemble it before the day appoint for its meet besides these councils or court there be another call the court of competitors which be thus constitute if any candidates for the office of senator have more vote than a third of the representatives that candidate who have most vote next to the senator elect become incapable for one year of all public offices even of be a magistrate or representative but he take his seat in the court of competitors here then be a court which may sometimes consist of a hundred members sometimes have no members at all and by that mean be for a year abolish the court of competitors have no power in the commonwealth it have only the inspection of public account and the accuse of any man before the senate if the senate acquit him the court of competitors may if they please appeal to the people either magistrates or representatives upon that appeal the magistrates or representatives meet on the day appoint by the court of competitors and chuse in each county three persons from which number every senator be exclude these to the number of meet in the capital and bring the person accuse to a new trial the court of competitors may propose any law to the senate and if refuse may appeal to the people that be to the magistrates or representatives who examine it in their counties every senator who be throw out of the senate by a vote of the court take his seat in the court of competitors the senate possess all the judicative authority of the house of lord that be all the appeal from the inferior court it likewise appoint the lord chancellor and all the officer of the law every county be a kind of republic within itself and the representatives may make byelaws which have no authority till three months after they be vote a copy of the law be send to the senate and to every other county the senate or any single county may at any time annul any byelaw of another county the representatives have all the authority of the british justices of peace in trials commitments c the magistrates have the appointment of all the officer of the revenue in each county all cause with regard to the revenue be carry ultimately by appeal before the magistrates they pass the accompts of all the officer but must have their own accompts examine and pass at the end of the year by the representatives the magistrates name rectors or minister to all the parishes the presbyterian government be establish and the highest ecclesiastical court be an assembly or synod of all the presbyters of the county the magistrates may take any cause from this court and determine it themselves the magistrates may try and depose or suspend any presbyter the militia be establish in imitation of that of swisserland which be well know we shall not insist upon it it will only be proper to make this addition that an army of men be annually draw out by rotation pay and encamp during six weeks in summer that the duty of a camp may not be altogether unknown the magistrates appoint all the colonels and downwards the senate all upwards during war the general appoint the colonel and downwards and his commission be good for a twelvemonth but after that it must be confirm by the magistrates of the county to which the regiment belong the magistrates may break any officer in the county regiment and the senate may do the same to any officer in the service if the magistrates do not think proper to confirm the general choice they may appoint another officer in the place of him they reject all crimes be try within the county by the magistrates and a jury but the senate can stop any trial and bring it before themselves any county may indict any man before the senate for any crime the protector the two secretaries the council of state with any five or more that the senate appoint be possess on extraordinary emergencies of dictatorial power for six months the protector may pardon any person condemn by the inferior court in time of war no officer of the army that be in the field can have any civil office in the commonwealth the capital which we shall call london may be allow four members in the senate it may therefore be divide into four counties the representatives of each of these chuse one senator and ten magistrates there be therefore in the city four senators fortyfour magistrates and four hundred representatives the magistrates have the same authority as in the counties the representatives also have the same authority but they never meet in one general court they give their vote in their particular county or division of hundreds when they enact any byelaw the greater number of counties or divisions determine the matter and where these be equal the magistrates have the cast vote the magistrates chuse the mayor sheriff recorder and other officer of the city in the commonwealth no representative magistrate or senator as such have any salary the protector secretaries councils and ambassadors have salaries the first year in every century be set apart for correct all inequalities which time may have produce in the representative this must be do by the legislature the follow political aphorisms may explain the reason of these order the lower sort of people and small proprietors be good judge enough of one not very distant from them in rank or habitation and therefore in their parochial meet will probably chuse the best or nearly the best representative but they be wholly unfit for countymeetings and for elect into the higher offices of the republic their ignorance give the grandees an opportunity of deceive them ten thousand even though they be not annually elect be a basis large enough for any free government it be true the nobles in poland be more than and yet these oppress the people but as power always continue there in the same persons and families this make them in a manner a different nation from the people besides the nobles be there unite under a few head of families all free governments must consist of two councils a lesser and greater or in other word of a senate and people the people as harrington observe would want wisdom without the senate the senate without the people would want honesty a large assembly of for instance to represent the people if allow to debate would fall into disorder if not allow to debate the senate have a negative upon them and the worst kind of negative that before resolution here therefore be an inconvenience which no government have yet fully remedied but which be the easiest to be remedied in the world if the people debate all be confusion if they do not debate they can only resolve and then the senate carve for them divide the people into many separate body and then they may debate with safety and every inconvenience seem to be prevent cardinal de retz say that all numerous assemblies however compose be mere mob and sway in their debate by the least motive this we find confirm by daily experience when an absurdity strike a member he convey it to his neighbour and so on till the whole be infect separate this great body and though every member be only of middle sense it be not probable that any thing but reason can prevail over the whole influence and example be remove good sense will always get the better of bad among a number of peoplec there be two things to be guard against in every senate its combination and its division its combination be most dangerous and against this inconvenience we have provide the follow remedy the great dependence of the senators on the people by annual elections and that not by an undistinguishing rabble like the english electors but by men of fortune and education the small power they be allow they have few offices to dispose of almost all be give by the magistrates in the counties the court of competitors which be compose of men that be their rival next to them in interest and uneasy in their present situation will be sure to take all advantage against them the division of the senate be prevent by the smallness of their number as faction suppose a combination in a separate interest it be prevent by their dependence on the people they have a power of expel any factious member it be true when another member of the same spirit come from the county they have no power of expel him nor be it fit they should for that show the humour to be in the people and may possibly arise from some ill conduct in public affairs almost any man in a senate so regularly choose by the people may be suppose fit for any civil office it would be proper therefore for the senate to form some general resolutions with regard to the dispose of offices among the members which resolutions would not confine them in critical time when extraordinary part on the one hand or extraordinary stupidity on the other appear in any senator but they would be sufficient to preventd intrigue and faction by make the disposal of the offices a thing of course for instance let it be a resolution that no man shall enjoy any office till he have sit four years in the senate that except ambassadors no man shall be in office two years follow that no man shall attain the higher offices but through the lower that no man shall be protector twice c the senate of venice govern themselves by such resolutions in foreign politics the interest of the senate can scarcely ever be divide from that of the people and therefore it be fit to make the senate absolute with regard to them otherwise there could be no secrecy or refine policy besides without money no alliance can be execute and the senate be still sufficiently dependant not to mention that the legislative power be always superior to the executive the magistrates or representatives may interpose whenever they think proper the chief support of the british government be the opposition of interest but that though in the main serviceable breed endless factions in the forego plan it do all the good without any of the harm the competitors have no power of control the senate they have only the power of accuse and appeal to the people it be necessary likewise to prevent both combination and division in the thousand magistrates this be do sufficiently by the separation of place and interest but lest that should not be sufficient their dependence on the for their elections serve to the same purpose nor be that all for the may resume the power whenever they please and not only when they all please but when any five of a hundred please which will happen upon the very first suspicion of a separate interest the be too large a body either to unite or divide except when they meet in one place and fall under the guidance of ambitious leaders not to mention their annual electione by the whole body of the people that be of any consideration a small commonwealth be the happiest government in the world within itself because every thing lie under the eye of the rulers but it may be subdue by great force from without this scheme seem to have all the advantage both of a great and a little commonwealth every countylaw may be annul either by the senate or another county because that show an opposition of interest in which case no part ought to decide for itself the matter must be refer to the whole which will best determine what agree with general interest as to the clergy and militia the reason of these order be obvious without the dependence of the clergy on the civil magistrates and without a militia it be in vain to think that any free government will ever have security or stability in many governments the inferior magistrates have no reward but what arise from their ambition vanity or public spirit the salaries of the french judge amount not to the interest of the sum they pay for their offices the dutch burgomasters have little more immediate profit than the english justices of peace or the members of the house of commons formerly but lest any should suspect that this would beget negligence in the administration which be little to be fear consider the natural ambition of mankind let the magistrates have competent salaries the senators have access to so many honourable and lucrative offices that their attendance need not be buy there be little attendance require of the representatives that the forego plan of government be practicable no one can doubt who consider the resemblance that it bear to the commonwealth of the unite provincesf a wise and renowned government the alterations in the present scheme seem all evidently for the better the representation be more equal the unlimited power of the burgomasters in the towns which form a perfect aristocracy in the dutch commonwealth be correct by a welltempered democracy in give to the people the annual election of the county representatives the negative which every province and town have upon the whole body of the dutch republic with regard to alliances peace and war and the imposition of tax be here remove the counties in the present plan be not so independent of each other nor do they form separate body so much as the seven provinces where the jealousy and envy of the smaller provinces and towns against the greater particularly holland and amsterdam have frequently disturb the government larger power though of the safest kind be intrust to the senate than the statesgeneral possess by which mean the former may become more expeditious and secret in their resolutions than it be possible for the latter the chief alterations that could be make on the british government in order to bring it to the most perfect model of limit monarchy seem to be the follow first the plan of gcromwells parliament ought to be restore by make the representation equal and by allow none to vote in the county elections who possess noth a property of pound value secondly as such a house of commons would be too weighty for a frail house of lord like the present the bishops and scotch peer ought to be removedi the number of the upper house ought to be raise to three or four hundred their seat not hereditary but during life they ought to have the election of their own members and no commoner should be allow to refuse a seat that be offer him by this mean the house of lord would consist entirely of the men of chief credit abilities and interest in the nation and every turbulent leader in the house of commons might be take off and connect by interest with the house of peer such an aristocracy would be an excellent barrier both to the monarchy and against it at present the balance of our government depend in some measure on the abilities and behaviour of the sovereign which be variable and uncertain circumstances this plan of limit monarchy however correct seem still liable to three great inconveniencies first it remove not entirely though it may soften the party of court and country secondly the kings personal character must still have great influence on the government thirdly the sword be in the hand of a single person who will always neglect to discipline the militia in order to have a pretence for keep up a stand armyj we shall conclude this subject with observe the falsehood of the common opinion that no large state such as france or great britain could ever be model into a commonwealth but that such a form of government can only take place in a city or small territory the contrary seem probable though it be more difficult to form a republican government in an extensive country than in a city there be more facility when once it be form of preserve it steady and uniform without tumult and faction it be not easy for the distant part of a large state to combine in any plan of free government but they easily conspire in the esteem and reverence for a single person who by mean of this popular favour may seize the power and force the more obstinate to submit may establish a monarchical government on the other hand a city readily concur in the same notions of government the natural equality of property favour liberty and the nearness of habitation enable the citizens mutually to assist each other even under absolute princes the subordinate government of cities be commonly republican while that of counties and provinces be monarchical but these same circumstances which facilitate the erection of commonwealths in cities render their constitution more frail and uncertain democracies be turbulent for however the people may be separate or divide into small party either in their vote or elections their near habitation in a city will always make the force of popular tide and currents very sensible aristocracies be better adapt for peace and order and accordingly be most admire by ancient writers but they be jealous and oppressive in a large government which be model with masterly skill there be compass and room enough to refine the democracy from the lower people who may be admit into the first elections or first concoction of the commonwealth to the higher magistrates who direct all the movements at the same time the part be so distant and remote that it be very difficult either by intrigue prejudice or passion to hurry them into any measure against the public interest it be needle to enquire whether such a government would be immortal allow the justness of the poets exclamation on the endless project of human race man and for ever the world itself probably be not immortal such consume plague may arise as would leave even a perfect government a weak prey to its neighbour we know not to what length enthusiasm or other extraordinary movements of the human mind may transport men to the neglect of all order and public good where difference of interest be remove whimsical and unaccountable factions often arise from personal favour or enmity perhaps rust may grow to the spring of the most accurate political machine and disorder its motion lastly extensive conquests when pursue must be the ruin of every free government and of the more perfect governments sooner than of the imperfect because of the very advantage which the former possess above the latter and though such a state ought to establish a fundamental law against conquests yet republics have ambition as well as individuals and present interest make men forgetful of their posterity it be a sufficient incitement to human endeavour that such a government would flourish for many age without pretend to bestow on any work of man that immortality which the almighty seem to have refuse to his own productions essay withdraw and unpublished essay of essaywriting the elegant part of mankind who be not immersd in the animal life but employ themselves in the operations of the mind may be divide into the learn and conversible the learn be such as have choose for their portion the higher and more difficult operations of the mind which require leisure and solitude and can not be bring to perfection without long preparation and severe labour the conversible world join to a sociable disposition and a taste of pleasure an inclination to the easier and more gentle exercise of the understand to obvious reflections on human affairs and the duties of common life and to the observation of the blemish or perfections of the particular object that surround them such subject of think furnish not sufficient employment in solitude but require the company and conversation of our fellowcreatures to render them a proper exercise for the mind and this bring mankind together in society where every one display his thoughts and observations in the best manner he be able and mutually give and receive information as well as pleasure the separation of the learn from the conversible world seem to have be the great defect of the last age and must have have a very bad influence both on book and company for what possibility be there of find topics of conversation fit for the entertainment of rational creatures without have recourse sometimes to history poetry politics and the more obvious principles at least of philosophy must our whole discourse be a continue series of gossipping stories and idle remark must the mind never rise higher but be perpetually stund and wear out with endless chat of will do this and nan say that this woud be to render the time spend in company the most unentertaining as well as the most unprofitable part of our live on the other hand learn have be as great a loser by be shut up in colleges and cells and seclude from the world and good company by that mean every thing of what we call bell lettres become totally barbarous be cultivate by men without any taste of life or manners and without that liberty and facility of think and expression which can only be acquird by conversation even philosophy go to wrack by this moaping recluse method of study and become as chimerical in her conclusions as she be unintelligible in her stile and manner of delivery and indeed what coud be expect from men who never consult experience in any of their reason or who never searchd for that experience where alone it be to be find in common life and conversation tis with great pleasure observe that men of letter in this age have lose in a great measure that shyness and bashfulness of temper which keep them at a distance from mankind and at the same time that men of the world be proud of borrow from book their most agreeable topics of conversation tis to be hopd that this league betwixt the learn and conversible worlds which be so happily begin will be still farther improvd to their mutual advantage and to that end know nothing more advantageous than such essay as these with which endeavour to entertain the public in this view can not but consider myself as a kind of resident or ambassador from the dominions of learn to those of conversation and shall think it my constant duty to promote a good correspondence betwixt these two state which have so great a dependence on each other shall give intelligence to the learn of whatever pass in company and shall endeavour to import into company whatever commodities find in my native country proper for their use and entertainment the balance of trade we need not be jealous of nor will there be any difficulty to preserve it on both side the materials of this commerce must chiefly be furnishd by conversation and common life the manufacture of them alone belong to learn as twoud be an unpardonable negligence in an ambassador not to pay his respect to the sovereign of the state where he be commissiond to reside so it woud be altogether inexcusable in me not to address myself with a particular respect to the fair sex who be the sovereigns of the empire of conversation approach them with reverence and be not my countrymen the learn a stubborn independent race of mortals extremely jealous of their liberty and unaccustomd to subjection shoud resign into their fair hand the sovereign authority over the republic of letter as the case stand my commission extend no farther than to desire a league offensive and defensive against our common enemies against the enemies of reason and beauty people of dull head and cold hearts from this moment let us pursue them with the severest vengeance let no quarter be give but to those of sound understand and delicate affections and these character tis to be presumd we shall always find inseparable to be serious and to quit the allusion before it be wear threadbare be of opinion that women that be women of sense and education for to such alone address myself be much better judge of all polite write than men of the same degree of understand and that tis a vain pannic if they be so far terrifyd with the common ridicule that be levelld against learn ladies as utterly to abandon every kind of book and study to our sex let the dread of that ridicule have no other effect than to make them conceal their knowledge before fool who be not worthy of it nor of them such will still presume upon the vain title of the male sex to affect a superiority above them but my fair readers may be assurd that all men of sense who know the world have a great deference for their judgment of such book as ly within the compass of their knowledge and repose more confidence in the delicacy of their taste tho unguided by rule than in all the dull labour of pedants and commentators in a neighbour nation equally famous for good taste and for gallantry the ladies be in a manner the sovereigns of the learn world as well as of the conversible and no polite writer pretend to venture upon the public without the approbation of some celebrate judge of that sex their verdict be indeed sometimes complaind of and in particular find that the admirers of corneille to save that great poets honour upon the ascendant that racine begin to take over him always say that it be not to be expect that so old a man could dispute the prize before such judge with so young a man as his rival but this observation have be find unjust since posterity seem to have ratifyd the verdict of that tribunal and racine tho dead be still the favourite of the fair sex as well as of the best judge among the men there be only one subject on which be apt to distrust the judgment of females and that be concern book of gallantry and devotion which they commonly affect as high fly as possible and most of them seem more delight with the warmth than with the justness of the passion mention gallantry and devotion as the same subject because in reality they become the same when treat in this manner and we may observe that they both depend upon the very same complexion as the fair sex have a great share of the tender and amorous disposition it pervert their judgment on this occasion and make them be easily affect even by what have no propriety in the expression nor nature in the sentiment mr addisons elegant discourse of religion have no relish with them in comparison of book of mystic devotion and otways tragedies be reject for the rant of mr dryden woud the ladies correct their false taste in this particular let them accustom themselves a little more to book of all kinds let them give encouragement to men of sense and knowledge to frequent their company and finally let them concur heartily in that union have project betwixt the learn and conversible worlds they may perhaps meet with more complaisance from their usual followers than from men of learn but they can not reasonably expect so sincere an affection and hope they will never be guilty of so wrong a choice as to sacrifice the substance to the shadow essay of moral prejudice there be a set of men lately spring up amongst us who endeavour to distinguish themselves by ridicule every thing that have hitherto appeard sacred and venerable in the eye of mankind reason sobriety honour friendship marriage be the perpetual subject of their insipid raillery and even public spirit and a regard to our country be treat as chimerical and romantic be the scheme of these antireformers to take place all the bond of society must be break to make way for the indulgence of a licentious mirth and gaiety the companion of our drunken frollics must be preferd to a friend or brother dissolute prodigality must be supplyd at the expence of every thing valuable either in public or private and men shall have so little regard to any thing beyond themselves that at last a free constitution of government must become a scheme perfectly impracticable among mankind and must degenerate into one universal system of fraud and corruption there be another humour which may be observd in some pretenders to wisdom and which if not so pernicious as the idle petulant humour abovementiond must however have a very bad effect on those who indulge it mean that grave philosophic endeavour after perfection which under pretext of reform prejudice and errors strike at all the most endear sentiments of the heart and all the most useful byasses and instincts which can govern a human creature the stoics be remarkable for this folly among the antients and wish some of more venerable character in latter time have not copyd them too faithfully in this particular the virtuous and tender sentiments or prejudice if you will have sufferd mightily by these reflections while a certain sullen pride or contempt of mankind have prevaild in their stead and have be esteemd the greatest wisdom tho in reality it be the most egregious folly of all others statilius be sollicited by brutus to make one of that noble band who strike the godlike stroke for the liberty of rome refusd to accompany them say that all men be fool or mad and do not deserve that a wise man should trouble his head about them my learn reader will here easily recollect the reason which an antient philosopher give why he woud not be reconcild to his brother who sollicited his friendship he be too much a philosopher to think that the connexion of have spring from the same parent ought to have any influence on a reasonable mind and exprest his sentiment after such a manner as think not proper to repeat

reveal all his tenderness nor be he so affectedly philosophical as even to call it by the name of weakness they know that he still keep the birthday of emira with tear and a more fond and tender recollection of past pleasures in like manner as it be celebrate in her lifetime with joy and festivity they know that he preserve her picture with the utmost care and have one picture in miniature which he always wear next to his bosom that he have leave order in his last will that in whatever part of the world he shall happen to die his body shall be transport and lay in the same grave with hers and that a monument shall be erect over them and their mutual love and happiness celebrate in an epitaph which he himself have composd for that purpose a few years ago receivd a letter from a friend who be abroad on his travel and shall here communicate it to the public it contain such an instance of a philosophic spirit as think pretty extraordinary and may serve as an example not to depart too far from the receivd maxims of conduct and behaviour by a refind search after happiness or perfection the story have be since assurd of as matter of fact parisaug sir know you be more curious of account of men than of build and be more desirous of be informd of private history than of public transactions for which reason think the follow story which be the common topic of conversation in this city woud be no unacceptable entertainment to you a young lady of birth and fortune be leave intirely at her own disposal persist long in a resolution of lead a single life notwithstanding several advantageous offer that have be make to her she have be determind to embrace this resolution by observe the many unhappy marriages among her acquaintance and by hear the complaints which her female friends make of the tyranny inconstancy jealousy or indifference of their husband be a woman of strong spirit and an uncommon way of think she find no difficulty either in form or maintain this resolution and coud not suspect herself of such weakness as ever to be inducd by any temptation to depart from it she have however entertaind a strong desire of have a son whose education she be resolvd to make the principal concern of her life and by that mean supply the place of those other passions which she be resolvd for ever to renounce she pushd her philosophy to such an uncommon length as to find no contradiction betwixt such a desire and her former resolution and accordingly lookd about with great deliberation to find among all her maleacquaintance one whose character and person be agreeable to her without be able to satisfy herself on that head at length be in the playhouse one even she see in the parterre a young man of a most engage countenance and modest deportment and feel such a prepossession in his favour that she have hop this must be the person she have long seek for in vain she immediately dispatch a servant to him desire his company at her lodge next morning the young man be overjoyd at the message and coud not command his satisfaction upon receive such an advance from a lady of so great beauty reputation and quality he be therefore much disappoint when he find a woman who woud allow him no freedoms and amidst all her oblige behaviour confind and overawd him to the bound of rational discourse and conversation she seemd however will to commence a friendship with him and tell him that his company woud always be acceptable to her whenever he have a leisure hour to bestow he need not much entreaty to renew his visit be so strike with her wit and beauty that he must have be unhappy have he be debarrd her company every conversation servd only the more to inflame his passion and give him more occasion to admire her person and understand as well as to rejoice in his own goodfortune he be not however without anxiety when he considerd the disproportion of their birth and fortune nor be his uneasiness allayd even when he reflect on the extraordinary manner in which their acquaintance have commencd our philosophical heroine in the mean time discoverd that her lovers personal qualities do not belye his phisiognomy so that judge there be no occasion for any farther trial she take a proper opportunity of communicate to him her whole intention their intercourse continud for sometime till at last her wish be crownd and she be now mother of a boy who be to be the object of her future care and concern gladly woud she have continud her friendship with the father but find him too passionate a lover to remain within the bound of friendship she be obligd to put a violence upon herself she send him a letter in which she have inclosd a bond of annuity for a thousand crown desire him at the same time never to see her more and to forget if possible all past favour and familiarities he be thunderstruck at receive this message and have try in vain all the arts that might win upon the resolution of a woman resolvd at last to attack her by her foible he commence a lawsuit against her before the parliament of paris and claim his son whom he pretend a right to educate as he pleasd accord to the usual maxims of the law in such case she plead on the other hand their express agreement before their commerce and pretend that he have renouncd all claim to any offspring that might arise from their embrace it be not yet know how the parliament will determine in this extraordinary case which puzzle all the lawyers as much as it do the philosophers as soon as they come to any issue shall inform you of it and shall embrace any opportunity of subscribe myself as do at present sir your most humble servant essay of the middle station of life the moral of the follow fable will easily discover itself without my explain it one rivulet meet another with whom he have be long unite in strictest amity with noisy haughtiness and disdain thus bespeak him what brother still in the same state still low and creep be you not ashamd when you behold me who tho lately in a like condition with you be now become a great river and shall shortly be able to rival the danube or the rhine provide those friendly rain continue which have favourd my bank but neglect yours very true reply the humble rivulet you be now indeed swoln to great size but methinks you be become withal somewhat turbulent and muddy be content with my low condition and my purity instead of comment upon this fable shall take occasion from it to compare the different station of life and to perswade such of my readers as be placd in the middle station to be satisfyd with it as the most eligible of all others these form the most numerous rank of men that can be supposd susceptible of philosophy and therefore all discourse of morality ought principally to be addressd to them the great be too much immersd in pleasure and the poor too much occupyd in provide for the necessities of life to hearken to the calm voice of reason the middle station as it be most happy in many respect so particularly in this that a man placd in it can with the greatest leisure consider his own happiness and reap a new enjoyment from compare his situation with that of persons above or below him agurs prayer be sufficiently note two things have requird of thee deny me them not before die remove far from me vanity and lie give me neither poverty nor riches fee me with food convenient for me lest be full and deny thee and say who be the lord or lest be poor and steal and take the name of my god in vain the middle station be here justly recommend as afford the fullest security for virtue and may also add that it give opportunity for the most ample exercise of it and furnish employment for every good quality which we can possibly be possest of those who be placd among the lower rank of men have little opportunity of exert any other virtue besides those of patience resignation industry and integrity those who be advancd into the higher station have full employment for their generosity humanity affability and charity when a man lyes betwixt these two extremes he can exert the former virtues towards his superiors and the latter towards his inferiors every moral quality which the human soul be susceptible of may have its turn and be call up to action and a man may after this manner be much more certain of his progress in virtue than where his good qualities lye dormant and without employment but there be another virtue that seem principally to ly among equal and be for that reason chiefly calculate for the middle station of life this virtue be friendship believe most men of generous temper be apt to envy the great when they consider the large opportunities such persons have of do good to their fellowcreatures and of acquire the friendship and esteem of men of merit they make no advance in vain and be not obligd to associate with those whom they have little kindness for like people of inferior station who be subject to have their proffer of friendship reject even where they woud be most fond of place their affections but tho the great have more facility in acquire friendships they can not be so certain of the sincerity of them as men of a lower rank since the favour they bestow may acquire them flattery instead of goodwill and kindness it have be very judiciously remarkd that we attach ourselves more by the service we perform than by those we receive and that a man be in danger of lose his friends by oblige them too far shoud therefore chuse to ly in the middle way and to have my commerce with my friend vary both by obligations give and receivd have too much pride to be will that all the obligations should ly on my side and shoud be afraid that if they all lay on his he woud also have too much pride to be entirely easy under them or have a perfect complacency in my company we may also remark of the middle station of life that it be more favourable to the acquire of wisdom and ability as well as of virtue and that a man so situate have a better chance for attain a knowledge both of men and things than those of a more elevate station he enter with more familiarity into human life every thing appear in its natural colour before him he have more leisure to form observations and have beside the motive of ambition to push him on in his attainments be certain that he can never rise to any distinction or eminence in the world without his own industry and here can not forbear communicate a remark which may appear somewhat extraordinary viz that tis wisely ordaind by providence that the middle station shoud be the most favourable to the improve our natural abilities since there be really more capacity requisite to perform the duties of that station than be requisite to act in the higher spheres of life there be more natural part and a stronger genius requisite to make a good lawyer or physician than to make a great monarch for let us take any race or succession of kings where birth alone give a title to the crown the english kings for instance who have not be esteem the most shin in history from the conquest to the succession of his present majesty we may reckon twenty eight sovereigns omit those who die minors of these eight be esteemd princes of great capacity viz the conquerorharry iiedward iedward harry and elisabeth and the late king william now believe every one will allow that in the common run of mankind there be not eight out of twenty eight who be fit by nature to make a figure either on the bench or at the bar since charles ten monarchs have reignd in france omit francis five of these have be esteemd princes of capacity viz loüis and francis and harry in short the govern of mankind well require a great deal of virtue justice and humanity but not a surprise capacity a certain pope whose name have forget usd to say let us divert ourselves my friends the world govern itself there be indeed some critical time such as those in which harry livd that call for the utmost vigour and a less courage and capacity than what appeard in that great monarch must have sink under the weight but such circumstances be rare and even then fortune do at least one half of the business since the common professions such as law or physic require equal if not superior capacity to what be exert in the higher spheres of life tis evident that the soul must be make of still a finer mold to shine in philosophy or poetry or in any of the higher part of learn courage and resolution be chiefly requisite in a commander justice and humanity in a statesman but genius and capacity in a scholar great general and great politicians be find in all age and countries of the world and frequently start up at once even amongst the greatest barbarians sweden be sink in ignorance when it producd gustavus ericson and gustavus adolphusmuscovy when the czar appeard and perhaps carthage when it give birth to hannibal but england must pass thro a long gradation of its spencersjohnsonswallers drydens before it arrive at an addison or a pope a happy talent for the liberal arts and sciences be a kind of prodigy among men nature must afford the richest genius that come from her hand education and example must cultivate it from the earliest infancy and industry must concur to carry it to any degree of perfection no man need be surprise to see koulikan among the persians but homer in so early an age among the greeks be certainly matter of the highest wonder a man can not show a genius for war who be not so fortunate as to be trust with command and it seldom happen in any state or kingdom that several at once be placd in that situation how many marlboroughs be there in the confederate army who never rise so much as to the command of a regiment but be perswaded there have be but one milton in england within these hundred years because every one may exert the talents for poetry who be possest of them and no one coud exert them under greater disadvantage than that divine poet if no man be allowd to write verse but who be beforehand namd to be laureat coud we expect a poet in ten thousand years be we to distinguish the rank of men by their genius and capacity more than by their virtue and usefulness to the public great philosophers woud certainly challenge the first rank and must be placd at the top of human kind so rare be this character that perhaps there have not as yet be above two in the world who can lay a just claim to it at least galilæo and newton seem to me so far to excel all the rest that can not admit any other into the same class with them great poets may challenge the second place and this species of genius tho rare be yet much more frequent than the former of the greek poets that remain homer alone seem to merit this character of the romans virgil horace and lucretius of the english milton and pope corneille racine boileau and voltaire of the french and tasso and ariosto of the italians great orators and historians be perhaps more rare than great poets but as the opportunities for exert the talents requisite for eloquence or acquire the knowledge requisite for write history depend in some measure upon fortune we can not pronounce these productions of genius to be more extraordinary than the former should now return from this digression and show that the middle station of life be more favourable to happiness as well as to virtue and wisdom but as the arguments that prove this seem pretty obvious shall here forbear insist on them essay of impudence and modesty be of opinion that the common complaints against providence be illgrounded and that the good or bad qualities of men be the cause of their good or bad fortune more than what be generally imagine there be no doubt instance to the contrary and these too pretty numerous but few in comparison of the instance we have of a right distribution of prosperity and adversity nor indeed could it be otherwise from the common course of human affairs to be endow with a benevolent disposition and to love others will almost infallibly procure love and esteem which be the chief circumstance in life and facilitate every enterprize and undertake besides the satisfaction which immediately result from it the case be much the same with the other virtues prosperity be naturally though not necessarily attach to virtue and merit and adversity in like manner to vice and folly must however confess that this rule admit of an exception with regard to one moral quality and that modesty have a natural tendency to conceal a man talents as impudence display them to the utmost and have be the only cause why many have rise in the world under all the disadvantage of low birth and little merit such indolence and incapacity be there in the generality of mankind that they be apt to receive a man for whatever he have a mind to put himself off for and admit his overbear air as proof of that merit which he assume to himself a decent assurance seem to be the natural attendant of virtue and few men can distinguish impudence from it as on the other hand diffidence be the natural result of vice and folly have draw disgrace upon modesty which in outward appearance so nearly resemble ita as impudence though really a vice have the same effect upon a man fortune as if it be a virtue so we may observe that it be almost as difficult to be attain and be in that respect distinguish from all the other vices which be acquire with little pain and continually encrease upon indulgence many a man be sensible that modesty be extremely prejudicial to him in make his fortune have resolve to be impudent and to put a bold face upon the matter but it be observable that such people have seldom succeed in the attempt but have be oblige to relapse into their primitive modesty nothing carry a man through the world like a true genuine natural impudence its counterfeit be good for nothing nor can ever support itself in any other attempt whatever fault a man commit and be sensible of he be so much the nearer his end but when he endeavour at impudence if he ever fail in the attempt the remembrance of that failure will make him blush and will infallibly disconcert him after which every blush be a cause for new blush till he be find out to be an arrant cheat and a vain pretender to impudence if any thing can give a modest man more assurance it must be some advantage of fortune which chance procure to him riches naturally gain a man a favourable reception in the world and give merit a double lustre when a person be endow with it and supply its place in a great measure when it be absent it be wonderful to observe what air of superiority fool and knaves with large possessions give themselves above men of the greatest merit in poverty nor do the men of merit make any strong opposition to these usurpations or rather seem to favour them by the modesty of their behaviour their good sense and experience make them diffident of their judgment and cause them to examine every thing with the greatest accuracy as on the other hand the delicacy of their sentiments make them timorous lest they commit fault and lose in the practice of the world that integrity of virtue so to speak of which they be so jealous to make wisdom agree with confidence be as difficult as to reconcile vice and modesty these be the reflections which have occur upon this subject of impudence and modesty and hope the reader will not be displease to see them work into the follow allegory jupiter in the begin join virtue wisdom and confidence together and vice folly and diffidence and thus connect send them into the world but though he think he have match them with great judgment and say that confidence be the natural companion of virtue and that vice deserve to be attend with diffidence they have not go far before dissension arise among them wisdom who be the guide of the one company be always accustom before she venture upon any road however beat to examine it carefully to enquire whither it lead what dangers difficulties and hindrances might possibly or probably occur in it in these deliberations she usually consume some time which delay be very displease to confidence who be always incline to hurry on without much forethought or deliberation in the first road he meet wisdom and virtue be inseparable but confidence one day follow his impetuous nature advance a considerable way before his guide and companion and not feel any want of their company he never enquire after them nor ever meet with them more in like manner the other society though join by jupiter disagree and separate as folly saw very little way before her she have nothing to determine concern the goodness of roads nor could give the preference to one above another and this want of resolution be encreased by diffidence who with her doubt and scruple always retard the journey this be a great annoyance to vice who love not to hear of difficulties and delay and be never satisfy without his full career in whatever his inclinations lead him to folly he know though she harken to diffidence would be easily manage when alone and therefore as a vicious horse throw his rider he openly beat away this controller of all his pleasures and proceed in his journey with folly from whom he be inseparable confidence and diffidence be after this manner both throw loose from their respective company wander for some time till at last chance lead them at the same time to one village confidence go directly up to the great house which belong to wealth the lord of the village and without stay for a porter intrude himself immediately into the innermost apartments where he find vice and folly well receive before him he join the train recommend himself very quickly to his landlord and enter into such familiarity with vice that he be enlist in the same company with folly they be frequent guests of wealth and from that moment inseparable diffidence in the mean time not dare to approach the great house accept of an invitation from poverty one of the tenant and enter the cottage find wisdom and virtue who be repulse by the landlord have retire thither virtue take compassion of her and wisdom find from her temper that she would easily improve so they admit her into their society accordingly by their mean she alter in a little time somewhat of her manner and become much more amiable and engage be now know by the name of modesty as ill company have a greater effect than good confidence though more refractory to counsel and example degenerate so far by the society of vice and folly as to pass by the name of impudence mankind who saw these societies as jupiter first join them and know nothing of these mutual desertions be thereby lead into strange mistake and wherever they see impudence make account of find virtue and wisdom and wherever they observe modesty call her attendants vice and folly essay of love and marriage know not whence it proceed that women be so apt to take amiss every thing which be say in disparagement of the marry state and always consider a satyr upon matrimony as a satyr upon themselves do they mean that they be the party principally concern and that if a backwardness to enter into that state should prevail in the world they would be the greatest sufferers or be they sensible that the misfortunes and miscarriages of the marry state be owe more to their sex than to ours hope they do not intend to confess either of these two particulars or to give such an advantage to their adversaries the men as even to allow them to suspect it have often have thoughts of comply with this humour of the fair sex and of write a panegyric upon marriage but in look around for materials they seem to be of so mix a nature that at the conclusion of my reflections find that be as much dispose to write a satyr which might be place on the opposite page of the panegyric and be afraid that as satyr be on most occasion think to contain more truth than panegyric should have do their cause more harm than good by this expedient to misrepresent facts be what know they will not require of me must be more a friend to truth than even to them where their interest be opposite shall tell the women what it be our sex complain of most in the marry state and if they be dispose to satisfy us in this particular all the other differences will easily be accommodate if be not mistake tis their love of dominion which be the grind of the quarrel tho tis very likely that they will think it an unreasonable love of it in us which make us insist so much upon that point however this may be no passion seem to have more influence on female mind than this for power and there be a remarkable instance in history of its prevail above another passion which be the only one that can be suppose a proper counterpoise for it we be tell that all the women in scythia once conspire against the men and keep the secret so well that they execute their design before they be suspect they surprise the men in drink or asleep bind them all fast in chain and have call a solemn council of the whole sex it be debate what expedient should be use to improve the present advantage and prevent their fall again into slavery to kill all the men do not seem to the relish of any part of the assembly notwithstanding the injuries formerly receive and they be afterwards please to make a great merit of this lenity of theirs it be therefore agree to put out the eye of the whole male sex and thereby resign in all future time the vanity which they could draw from their beauty in order to secure their authority we must no longer pretend to dress and show say they but then we shall be free from slavery we shall hear no more tender sigh but in return we shall hear no more imperious command love must for ever leave us but he will carry subjection along with him tis regard by some as an unlucky circumstance since the women be resolve to maim the men and deprive them of some of their sense in order to render them humble and dependent that the sense of hear could not serve their purpose since tis probable the females would rather have attack that than the sight and think it be agree among the learn that in a marry state tis not near so great an inconvenience to lose the former sense as the latter however this may be we be tell by modern anecdotes that some of the scythian women do secretly spare their husband eye presume suppose that they could govern them as well by mean of that sense as without it but so incorrigible and untractable be these men that their wive be all oblige in a few years as their youth and beauty decay to imitate the example of their sisters which it be no difficult matter to do in a state where the female sex have once get the superiority know not if our scottish ladies derive any thing of this humour from their scythian ancestors but must confess that have often be surprized to see a woman very well please to take a fool for her mate that she might govern with the less controul and could not but think her sentiments in this respect still more barbarous than those of the scythian women abovementioned as much as the eye of the understand be more valuable than those of the body but to be just and to lay the blame more equally be afraid it be the fault of our sex if the women be so fond of rule and that if we do not abuse our authority they would never think it worth while to dispute it tyrants we know produce rebel and all history inform us that rebel when they prevail be apt to become tyrants in their turn for this reason could wish there be no pretensions to authority on either side but that every thing be carry on with perfect equality as between two equal members of the same body and to induce both party to embrace those amicable sentiments shall deliver to them platos account of the origin of love and marriage mankind accord to that fanciful philosopher be not in their original divide into male and female as at present but each individual person be a compound of both sex and be in himself both husband and wife melt down into one live creature this union no doubt be very intire and the part very well adjust together since there result a perfect harmony betwixt the male and female altho they be oblige to be inseparable companion and so great be the harmony and happiness flow from it that the androgynes for so plato call them or menwomen become insolent upon their prosperity and rebel against the gods to punish them for this temerity jupiter could contrive no better expedient than to divorce the malepart from the female and make two imperfect be of the compound which be before so perfect hence the origin of men and women as distinct creatures but notwithstanding this division so lively be our remembrance of the happiness which we enjoy in our primæval state that we be never at rest in this situation but each of these halve be continually search thro the whole species to find the other half which be break from it and when they meet they join again with the greatest fondness and sympathy but it often happen that they be mistake in this particular that they take for their half what no way correspond to them and that the part do not meet nor join in with each other as be usual in fracture in this case the union be soon dissolve and each part be set loose again to hunt for its lose half join itself to every one whom it meet by way of trial and enjoy no rest till its perfect sympathy with its partner shew that it have at last be successful in its endeavour be dispose to carry on this fiction of plato which account for the mutual love betwixt the sex in so agreeable a manner would do it by the follow allegory when jupiter have separate the male from the female and have quell their pride and ambition by so severe an operation he could not but repent him of the cruelty of his vengeance and take compassion on poor mortals who be now become incapable of any repose or tranquillity such crave such anxieties such necessities arise as make them curse their creation and think existence itself a punishment in vain have they recourse to every other occupation and amusement in vain do they seek after every pleasure of sense and every refinement of reason nothing could fill that void which they felt in their hearts or supply the loss of their partner who be so fatally separate from them to remedy this disorder and to bestow some comfort at least on the human race in their forlorn situation jupiter send down love and hymen to collect the break halve of human kind and piece them together in the best manner possible these two deities find such a prompt disposition in mankind to unite again in their primæval state that they proceed on their work with wonderful success for some time till at last from many unlucky accidents dissension arise betwixt them the chief counsellor and favourite of hymen be care who be continually fill his patrons head with prospect of futurity a settlement family children servants so that little else be regard in all the match they make on the other hand love have choose pleasure for his favourite who be as pernicious a counsellor as the other and would never allow love to look beyond the present momentary gratification or the satisfy of the prevail inclination these two favourites become in a little time irreconcileable enemies and make it their chief business to undermine each other in all their undertake no sooner have love fix upon two halve which he be cement together and form to a close union but care insinuate himself and bring hymen along with him dissolve the union produce by love and join each half to some other half which he have provide for it to be revenge of this pleasure creep in upon a pair already join by hymen and call love to his assistance they under hand contrive to join each half by secret link to halve which hymen be wholly unacquainted with it be not long before this quarrel be felt in its pernicious consequences and such complaints arise before the throne of jupiter that he be oblige to summon the offend party to appear before him in order to give an account of their proceed after hear the plead on both side he order an immediate reconcilement betwixt love and hymen as the only expedient for give happiness to mankind and that he might be sure this reconcilement should be durable he lay his strict injunctions on them never to join any halve without consult their favourites care and pleasure and obtain the consent of both to the conjunction where this order be strictly observe the androgyne be perfectly restore and the human race enjoy the same happiness as in their primæval state the seam be scarce perceive that join the two be but both of them combine to form one perfect and happy creature essay of the study of history there be nothing which would recommend more earnestly to my female readers than the study of history as an occupation of all others the best suit both to their sex and education much more instructive than their ordinary book of amusement and more entertain than those serious compositions which be usually to be find in their closet among other important truths which they may learn from history they may be inform of two particulars the knowledge of which may contribute very much to their quiet and repose that our sex as well as theirs be far from be such perfect creatures as they be apt to imagine and that love be not the only passion which govern the maleworld but be often overcome by avarice ambition vanity and a thousand other passions whether they be the false representations of mankind in those two particulars which endear romance and novels so much to the fair sex know not but must confess that be sorry to see them have such an aversion to matter of fact and such an appetite for falshood remember be once desire by a young beauty for whom have some passion to send her some novels and romance for her amusement in the country but be not so ungenerous as to take the advantage which such a course of read might have give me be resolve not to make use of poison arm against her therefore send her plutarchs live assure her at the same time that there be not a word of truth in them from begin to end she peruse them very attentively till she come to the live of alexander and cæsar whose name she have hear of by accident and then return me the book with many reproach for deceive her may indeed be tell that the fair sex have no such aversion to history as have represent provide it be secret history and contain some memorable transaction proper to excite their curiosity but as do not find that truth which be the basis of history be at all regard in those anecdotes can not admit of this as a proof of their passion for that study however this may be see not why the same curiosity might not receive a more proper direction and lead them to desire account of those who live in past age as well as of their cotemporaries what be it to cleora whether fulvia entertain a secret commerce of love with philander or not have she not equal reason to be please when she be inform what be whisper about among historians that catos sister have an intrigue with cæsar and palm her son marcus brutus upon her husband for his own tho in reality he be her gallants and be not the love of messalina or julia as proper subject of discourse as any intrigue that this city have produce of late years but know not whence it come that have be thus seduce into a kind of raillery against the ladies unless perhaps it proceed from the same cause which make the person who be the favourite of the company be often the object of their goodnatured jest and pleasantries we be please to address ourselves after any manner to one who be agreeable to us and at the same time presume that nothing will be take amiss by a person who be secure of the good opinion and affections of every one present shall now proceed to handle my subject more seriously and shall point out the many advantage which flow from the study of history and show how well suit it be to every one but particularly to those who be debar the severer study by the tenderness of their complexion and the weakness of their education the advantage find in history seem to be of three kinds as it amuse the fancy as it improve the understand and as it strengthen virtue in reality what more agreeable entertainment to the mind than to be transport into the remotest age of the world and to observe human society in its infancy make the first faint essay towards the arts and sciences to see the policy of government and the civility of conversation refine by degrees and every thing which be ornamental to human life advance towards its perfection to remark the rise progress declension and final extinction of the most flourish empires the virtues which contribute to their greatness and the vices which draw on their ruin in short to see all human race from the begin of time pass as it be in review before us appear in their true colour without any of those disguise which during their lifetime so much perplex the judgment of the beholders what spectacle can be imagine so magnificent so various so interest what amusement either of the sense or imagination can be compare with it shall those trifle pastimes which engross so much of our time be prefer as more satisfactory and more fit to engage our attention how perverse must that taste be which be capable of so wrong a choice of pleasures but history be a most improve part of knowledge as well as an agreeable amusement and a great part of what we commonly call erudition and value so highly be nothing but an acquaintance with historical facts an extensive knowledge of this kind belong to men of letter but must think it an unpardonable ignorance in persons of whatever sex or condition not to be acquaint with the history of their own country together with the histories of ancient greece and rome a woman may behave herself with good manners and have even some vivacity in her turn of wit but where her mind be so unfurnished tis impossible her conversation can afford any entertainment to men of sense and reflection must add that history be not only a valuable part of knowledge but open the door to many other part and afford materials to most of the sciences and indeed if we consider the shortness of human life and our limit knowledge even of what pass in our own time we must be sensible that we should be for ever children in understand be it not for this invention which extend our experience to all past age and to the most distant nations make them contribute as much to our improvement in wisdom as if they have actually lie under our observation a man acquaint with history may in some respect be say to have live from the begin of the world and to have be make continual additions to his stock of knowledge in every century there be also an advantage in that experience which be acquire by history above what be learn by the practice of the world that it bring us acquaint with human affairs without diminish in the least from the most delicate sentiments of virtue and to tell the truth know not any study or occupation so unexceptionable as history in this particular poets can paint virtue in the most charm colour but as they address themselves entirely to the passions they often become advocate for vice even philosophers be apt to bewilder themselves in the subtilty of their speculations and we have see some go so far as to deny the reality of all moral distinctions but think it a remark worthy the attention of the speculative that the historians have be almost without exception the true friends of virtue and have always represent it in its proper colour however they may have err in their judgments of particular persons machiavel himself discover a true sentiment of virtue in his history of florence when he talk as a politician in his general reason he consider poison assassination and perjury as lawful arts of power but when he speak as an historian in his particular narrations he show so keen an indignation against vice and so warm an approbation of virtue in many passages that could not forbear apply to him that remark of horace that if you chace away nature tho with ever so great indignity she will always return upon you nor be this combination of historians in favour of virtue at all difficult to be account for when a man of business enter into life and action he be more apt to consider the character of men as they have relation to his interest than as they stand in themselves and have his judgment warp on every occasion by the violence of his passion when a philosopher contemplate character and manners in his closet the general abstract view of the object leave the mind so cold and unmoved that the sentiments of nature have no room to play and he scarce feel the difference between vice and virtue history keep in a just medium betwixt these extremes and place the object in their true point of view the writers of history as well as the readers be sufficiently interest in the character and events to have a lively sentiment of blame or praise and at the same time have no particular interest or concern to pervert their judgment veræ voces tum demum pectore ab imo eliciuntur lucret a essay of avarice tis easy to observe that comic writers exaggerate every character and draw their fop or coward with stronger feature than be any where to be meet with in nature this moral kind of paint for the stage have be often compare to the paint for cupolas and cielings where the colour be overcharge and every part be draw excessively large and beyond nature the figure seem monstrous and disproportioned when see too nigh but become natural and regular when set at a distance and place in that point of view in which they be intend to be survey for a like reason when character be exhibit in theatrical representations the want of reality remove in a manner the personages and render them more cold and unentertaining make it necessary to compensate by the force of colour what they want in substance thus we find in common life that when a man once allow himself to depart from truth in his narrations he never can keep within the bound of probability but add still some new circumstance to render his stories more marvellous and to satisfy his imagination two men in buckram suit become eleven to sir john falstaff before the end of his story there be only one vice which may be find in life with as strong feature and as high a colour as need be employ by any satyrist or comic poet and that be avarice every day we meet with men of immense fortunes without heirs and on the very brink of the grave who refuse themselves the most common necessaries of life and go on heap possessions on possessions under all the real pressure of the severest poverty an old usurer say the story lie in his last agonies be present by the priest with the crucifix to worship he open his eye a moment before he expire consider the crucifix and cry these jewel be not true can only lend ten pistoles upon such a pledge this be probably the invention of some epigrammatist and yet every one from his own experience may be able to recollect almost as strong instance of perseverance in avarice tis commonly report of a famous miser in this city that find himself near death he send for some of the magistrates and give them a bill of an hundred pound payable after his decease which sum he intend should be dispose of in charitable use but scarce be they go when he order them to be call back and offer them ready money if they would abate five pound of the sum another note miser in the north intend to defraud his heirs and leave his fortune to the build of an hospital protract the draw of his will from day to day and tis think that if those interest in it have not pay for the draw it he have die intestate in short none of the most furious excesses of love and ambition be in any respect to be compare to the extremes of avarice the best excuse that can be make for avarice be that it generally prevail in old men or in men of cold temper where all the other affections be extinct and the mind be incapable of remain without some passion or pursuit at last find out this monstrously absurd one which suit the coldness and inactivity of its temper at the same time it seem very extraordinary that so frosty spiritless a passion should be able to carry us farther than all the warmth of youth and pleasure but if we look more narrowly into the matter we shall find that this very circumstance render the explication of the case more easy when the temper be warm and full of vigour it naturally shoot out more ways than one and produce inferior passions to counterbalance in some degree its predominant inclination tis impossible for a person of that temper however bend on any pursuit to be deprive of all sense of shame or all regard to the sentiments of mankind his friends must have some influence over him and other considerations be apt to have their weight all this serve to restrain him within some bound but tis no wonder that the avaritious man be from the coldness of his temper without regard to reputation to friendship or to pleasure should be carry so far by his prevail inclination and should display his passion in such surprise instance accordingly we find no vice so irreclaimable as avarice and though there scarcely have be a moralist or philosopher from the begin of the world to this day who have not level a stroke at it we hardly find a single instance of any persons be cure of it for this reason be more apt to approve of those who attack it with wit and humour than of those who treat it in a serious manner there be so little hop of do good to the people infect with this vice would have the rest of mankind at least divert by our manner of expose it as indeed there be no kind of diversion of which they seem so will to partake among the fables of monsieur de lamotte there be one level against avarice which seem to me more natural and easy than most of the fables of that ingenious author a miser say he be dead and fairly inter come to the bank of the styx desire to be ferry over along with the other ghost charon demand his fare and be surprized to see the miser rather than pay it throw himself into the river and swim over to the other side notwithstanding all the clamour and opposition that could be make to him all hell be in an uproar and each of the judge be meditate some punishment suitable to a crime of such dangerous consequence to the infernal revenues shall he be chain to the rock with prometheus or tremble below the precipice in company with the danaides or assist sisyphus in roll his stone no say minos none of these we must invent some severer punishment let him be send back to the earth to see the use his heirs be make of his riches hope it will not be interpret as a design of set myself in opposition to this celebrate author if proceed to deliver a fable of my own which be intend to expose the same vice of avarice the hint of it be take from these line of mr pope damnd to the mine an equal fate betide the slave that dig it and the slave that hide our old mother earth once lodge an indictment against avarice before the court of heaven for her wicked and malicious council and advice in tempt induce persuade and traiterously seduce the children of the plaintiff to commit the detestable crime of parricide upon her and mangle her body ransack her very bowels for hide treasure the indictment be very long and verbose but we must omit a great part of the repetitions and synonymous term not to tire our readers too much with our tale avarice be call before jupiter to answer to this charge have not much to say in her own defence the injustice be clearly prove upon her the fact indeed be notorious and the injury have be frequently repeat when therefore the plaintiff demand justice jupiter very readily give sentence in her favour and his decree be to this purpose that since dame avarice the defendant have thus grievously injure dame earth the plaintiff she be hereby order to take that treasure of which she have feloniously rob the say plaintiff by ransack her bosom and in the same manner as before open her bosom restore it back to her without diminution or retention from this sentence it shall follow say jupiter to the bystanders that in all future age the retainers of avarice shall bury and conceal their riches and thereby restore to the earth what they take from her essay a character of sir robert walpole there never be a man whose action and character have be more earnestly and openly canvass than those of the present minister who have govern a learn and free nation for so long a time amidst such mighty opposition may make a large library of what have be write for and against him and be the subject of above half the paper that have be blot in the nation within these twenty years wish for the honour of our country that any one character of him have be draw with such judgment and impartiality as to have some credit with posterity and to shew that our liberty have once at least be employ to good purpose be only afraid of fail in the former quality of judgment but if it should be so tis but one page more throw away after an hundred thousand upon the same subject that have perish and become useless in the mean time shall flatter myself with the please imagination that the follow character will be adopt by future historians sir robert walpole prime minister of great britain be a man of ability not a genius goodnatured not virtuous constant not magnanimous moderate not equitable his virtues in some instance be free from the allay of those vices which usually accompany such virtues he be a generous friend without be a bitter enemy his vices in other instance be not compensate by those virtues which be nearly ally to them his want of enterprise be not attend with frugality the private character of the man be better than the public his virtues more than his vices his fortune greater than his fame with many good qualities he have incur the public hatred with good capacity he have not escape ridicule he would have be esteem more worthy of his high station have he never possess it and be better qualify for the second than for the first place in any government his ministry have be more advantageous to his family than to the public better for this age than for posterity and more pernicious by bad precedents than by real grievances during his time trade have flourish liberty decline and learn go to ruin as be a man love him as be a scholar hate him as be a briton calmly wish his fall and be a member of either house would give my vote for remove him from st jam but should be glad to see him retire to houghtonhall to pass the remainder of his days in ease and pleasure essay of suicide one considerable advantage that arise from philosophy consist in the sovereign antidote which it afford to superstition and false religion all other remedy against that pestilent distemper be vain or at least uncertain plain goodsense and the practice of the world which alone serve most purpose of life be here find ineffectual history as well as daily experience afford instance of men endow with the strongest capacity for business and affairs who have all their live crouch under slavery to the grossest superstition even gaiety and sweetness of temper which infuse a balm into every other wind afford no remedy to so virulent a poison as we may particularly observe of the fair sex who tho commonly possess of these rich present of nature feel many of their joy blast by this importunate intruder but when sound philosophy have once gain possession of the mind superstition be effectually exclude and one may safely affirm that her triumph over this enemy be more compleat than over most of the vices and imperfections incident to human nature love or anger ambition or avarice have their root in the temper and affections which the soundest reason be scarce ever able fully to correct but superstition be found on false opinion must immediately vanish when true philosophy have inspire juster sentiments of superior power the contest be here more equal between the distemper and the medicine and nothing can hinder the latter from prove effectual but its be false and sophisticate it will here be superfluous to magnify the merit of philosophy by display the pernicious tendency of that vice of which it cure the human mind the superstitious man say tully be miserable in every scene in every incident of life even sleep itself which banish all other care of unhappy mortals afford to him matter of new terror while he examine his dream and find in those visions of the night prognostications of future calamities may add that tho death alone can put a full period to his misery he dare not fly to this refuge but still prolong a miserable existence from a vain fear lest he offend his maker by use the power with which that beneficent be have endow him the present of god and nature be ravish from us by this cruel enemy and notwithstanding that one step would remove us from the regions of pain and sorrow her menace still chain us down to a hat be which she herself chiefly contribute to render miserable it be observe of such as have be reduce by the calamities of life to the necessity of employ this fatal remedy that if the unseasonable care of their friends deprive them of that species of death which they propose to themselves they seldom venture upon any other or can summon up so much resolution a second time as to execute their purpose so great be our horror of death that when it present itself under any form besides that to which a man have endeavour to reconcile his imagination it acquire new terrors and overcome his feeble courage but when the menace of superstition be join to this natural timidity no wonder it quite deprive men of all power over their live since even many pleasures and enjoyments to which we be carry by a strong propensity be tear from us by this inhuman tyrant let us here endeavour to restore men to their native liberty by examine all the common arguments against suicide and shew that that action may be free from every imputation of guilt or blame accord to the sentiments of all the antient philosophers if suicide be criminal it must be a transgression of our duty either to god our neighbour or ourselves to prove that suicide be no transgression of our duty to god the follow considerations may perhaps suffice in order to govern the material world the almighty creator have establish general and immutable laws by which all body from the greatest planet to the smallest particle of matter be maintain in their proper sphere and function to govern the animal world he have endow all live creatures with bodily and mental power with sense passions appetites memory and judgment by which they be impel or regulate in that course of life to which they be destine these two distinct principles of the material and animal world continually encroach upon each other and mutually retard or forward each others operation the power of men and of all other animals be restrain and direct by the nature and qualities of the surround body and the modifications and action of these body be incessantly alter by the operation of all animals man be stop by rivers in his passage over the surface of the earth and rivers when properly direct lend their force to the motion of machine which serve to the use of man but tho the provinces of the material and animal power be not keep entirely separate there result from thence no discord or disorder in the creation on the contrary from the mixture union and contrast of all the various power of inanimate body and live creatures arise that surprizing harmony and proportion which afford the surest argument of supreme wisdom the providence of the deity appear not immediately in any operation but govern every thing by those general and immutable laws which have be establish from the begin of time all events in one sense may be pronounce the action of the almighty they all proceed from those power with which he have endow his creatures a house which fall by its own weight be not bring to ruin by his providence more than one destroy by the hand of men nor be the human faculties less his workmanship than the laws of motion and gravitation when the passions play when the judgment dictate when the limbs obey this be all the operation of god and upon these animate principles as well as upon the inanimate have he establish the government of the universe every event be alike important in the eye of that infinite be who take in at one glance the most distant regions of space and remotest periods of time there be no one event however important to us which he have exempt from the general laws that govern the universe or which he have peculiarly reserve for his own immediate action and operation the revolutions of state and empires depend upon the smallest caprice or passion of single men and the live of men be shorten or extend by the smallest accident of air or diet sunshine or tempest nature still continue her progress and operation and if general laws be ever break by particular volitions of the deity tis after a manner which entirely escape human observation as on the one hand the elements and other inanimate part of the creation carry on their action without regard to the particular interest and situation of men so men be entrust to their own judgment and discretion in the various shock of matter and may employ every faculty with which they be endow in order to provide for their ease happiness or preservation what be the mean then of that principle that a man who tire of life and hunt by pain and misery bravely overcome all the natural terrors of death and make his escape from this cruel scene that such a man say have incur the indignation of his creator by encroach on the office of divine providence and disturb the order of the universe shall we assert that the almighty have reserve to himself in any peculiar manner the disposal of the live of men and have not submit that event in common with others to the general laws by which the universe be govern this be plainly false the live of men depend upon the same laws as the live of all other animals and these be subject to the general laws of matter and motion the fall of a tower or the infusion of a poison will destroy a man equally with the meanest creature an inundation sweep away every thing without distinction that come within the reach of its fury since therefore the live of men be for ever dependent on the general laws of matter and motion be a man dispose of his life criminal because in every case it be criminal to encroach upon these laws or disturb their operation but this seem absurd all animals be entrust to their own prudence and skill for their conduct in the world and have full authority as far as their power extend to alter all the operations of nature without the exercise of this authority they could not subsist a moment every action every motion of a man innovate in the order of some part of matter and divert from their ordinary course the general laws of motion put together therefore these conclusions we find that human life depend upon the general laws of matter and motion and that tis no encroachment on the office of providence to disturb or alter these general laws have not every one of consequence the free disposal of his own life and may he not lawfully employ that power with which nature have endow him in order to destroy the evidence of this conclusion we must shew a reason why this particular case be except be it because human life be of so great importance that it be a presumption for human prudence to dispose of it but the life of man be of no greater importance to the universe than that of an oyster and be it of ever so great importance the order of nature have actually submit it to human prudence and reduce us to a necessity in every incident of determine concern it be the disposal of human life so much reserve as the peculiar province of the almighty that it be an encroachment on his right for men to dispose of their own live it would be equally criminal to act for the preservation of life as for its destruction if turn aside a stone which be fall upon my head disturb the course of nature and invade the peculiar province of the almighty by lengthen out my life beyond the period which by the general laws of matter and motion he have assign to it a hair a fly an insect be able to destroy this mighty be whose life be of such importance be it an absurdity to suppose that human prudence may lawfully dispose of what depend on such insignificant cause it would be no crime in me to divert the nile or danube from its course be able to effect such purpose where then be the crime of turn a few ounces of blood from their natural chanels do you imagine that repine at providence or curse my creation because go out of life and put a period to a be which be it to continue would render me miserable far be such sentiments from me be only convince of a matter of fact which you yourself acknowledge possible that human life may be unhappy and that my existence if farther prolong would become uneligible but thank providence both for the good which have already enjoy and for the power with which be endow of escape the ill that threaten me to you it belong to repine at providence who foolishly imagine that you have no such power and who must still prolong a hat be tho load with pain and sickness with shame and poverty do you not teach that when any ill befall me tho by the malice of my enemies ought to be resign to providence and that the action of men be the operations of the almighty as much as the action of inanimate be when fall upon my own sword therefore receive my death equally from the hand of the deity as if it have proceed from a lion a precipice or a fever the submission which you require to providence in every calamity that befall me exclude not human skill and industry if possibly by their mean can avoid or escape the calamity and why may not employ one remedy as well as another if my life be not my own it be criminal for me to put it in danger as well as to dispose of it nor could one man deserve the appellation of hero whom glory or friendship transport into the greatest dangers and another merit the reproach of wretch or miscreant who put a period to his life from the same or like motives there be no be which possess any power or faculty that it receive not from its creator nor be there any one which by ever so irregular an action can encroach upon the plan of his providence or disorder the universe its operations be his work equally with that chain of events which it invade and which ever principle prevail we may for that very reason conclude it to be most favour by him be it animate or inanimate rational or irrational tis all a case its power be still derive from the supreme creator and be alike comprehend in the order of his providence when the horror of pain prevail over the love of life when a voluntary action anticipate the effect of blind cause it be only in consequence of those power and principles which he have implant in his creatures divine providence be still inviolate and place far beyond the reach of human injuries it be impious say the old roman superstition to divert rivers from their course or invade the prerogatives of nature tis impious say the french superstition to inoculate for the smallpox or usurp the business of providence by voluntarily produce distemper and maladies tis impious say the modern european superstition to put a period to our own life and thereby rebel against our creator and why not impious say to build house cultivate the grind and sail upon the ocean in all these action we employ our power of mind and body to produce some innovation in the course of nature and in none of them do we any more they be all of them therefore equally innocent or equally criminal but you be place by providence like a sentinel in a particular station and when you desert it without be recall you be guilty of rebellion against your almighty sovereign and have incur his displeasure ask why do you conclude that providence have place me in this station for my part find that owe my birth to a long chain of cause of which many and even the principal depend upon voluntary action of men but providence guide all these cause and nothing happen in the universe without its consent and cooperation if so then neither do my death however voluntary happen without its consent and whenever pain and sorrow so far overcome my patience as to make me tire of life may conclude that be recall from my station in the clearest and most express term it be providence surely that have place me at present in this chamber but may not leave it when think proper without be liable to the imputation of have desert my post or station when shall be dead the principles of which be compose will still perform their part in the universe and will be equally useful in the grand fabric as when they compose this individual creature the difference to the whole will be no greater than between my be in a chamber and in the open air the one change be of more importance to me than the other but not more so to the universe it be a kind of blasphemy to imagine that any create be can disturb the order of the world or invade the business of providence it suppose that that be possess power and faculties which it receive not from its creator and which be not subordinate to his government and authority a man may disturb society no doubt and thereby incur the displeasure of the almighty but the government of the world be place far beyond his reach and violence and how do it appear that the almighty be displease with those action that disturb society by the principles which he have implant in human nature and which inspire us with a sentiment of remorse if we ourselves have be guilty of such action and with that of blame and disapprobation if we ever observe them in others let us now examine accord to the method propose whether suicide be of this kind of action and be a breach of our duty to our neighbour and to society a man who retire from life do no harm to society he only cease to do good which if it be an injury be of the lowest kind all our obligations to do good to society seem to imply something reciprocal receive the benefit of society and therefore ought to promote its interest but when withdraw myself altogether from society can be bind any longer but allow that our obligations to do good be perpetual they have certainly some bound be not oblige to do a small good to society at the expence of a great harm to myself why then should prolong a miserable existence because of some frivolous advantage which the public may perhaps receive from me if upon account of age and infirmities may lawfully resign any office and employ my time altogether in fence against these calamities and alleviate as much as possible the miseries of my future life why may not cut short these miseries at once by an action which be no more prejudicial to society but suppose that it be no longer in my power to promote the interest of the public suppose that be a burthen to it suppose that my life hinder some person from be much more useful to the public in such case my resignation of life must not only be innocent but laudable and most people who lie under any temptation to abandon existence be in some such situation those who have health or power or authority have commonly better reason to be in humour with the world a man be engage in a conspiracy for the public interest be seize upon suspicion be threaten with the rack and know from his own weakness that the secret will be extort from him could such a one consult the public interest better than by put a quick period to a miserable life this be the case of the famous and brave strozzi of florence again suppose a malefactor justly condemn to a shameful death can any reason be imagine why he may not anticipate his punishment and save himself all the anguish of think on its dreadful approach he invade the business of providence no more than the magistrate do who order his execution and his voluntary death be equally advantageous to society by rid it of a pernicious member that suicide may often be consistent with interest and with our duty to ourselves no one can question who allow that age sickness or misfortune may render life a burthen and make it worse even than annihilation believe that no man ever throw away life while it be worth keep for such be our natural horror of death that small motives will never be able to reconcile us to it and tho perhaps the situation of a man health or fortune do not seem to require this remedy we may at least be assure that any one who without apparent reason have have recourse to it be curse with such an incurable depravity or gloominess of temper as must poison all enjoyment and render him equally miserable as if he have be load with the most grievous misfortunes if suicide be suppose a crime tis only cowardice can impel us to it if it be no crime both prudence and courage should engage us to rid ourselves at once of existence when it become a burthen tis the only way that we can then be useful to society by set an example which if imitate would preserve to every one his chance for happiness in life and would effectually free him from all danger of misery essay of the immortality of the soul by the mere light of reason it seem difficult to prove the immortality of the soul the arguments for it be commonly derive either from metaphysical topics or moral or physical but in reality it be the gospel and the gospel alone that have bring life and immortality to light metaphysical topics be found on the supposition that the soul be immaterial and that it be impossible for think to belong to a material substance but just metaphysics teach us that the notion of substance be wholly confuse and imperfect and that we have no other idea of any substance than as an aggregate of particular qualities inhere in an unknown something matter therefore and spirit be at bottom equally unknown and we can not determine what qualities may inhere in the one or in the other they likewise teach us that nothing can be decide a priori concern any cause or effect and that experience be the only source of our judgments of this nature we can not know from any other principle whether matter by its structure or arrangement may not be the cause of think abstract reason can not decide any question of fact or existence but admit a spiritual substance to be disperse throughout the universe like the etherial fire of the stoics and to be the only inherent subject of think we have reason to conclude from analogy that nature use it after the same manner she do the other substance matter she employ it as a kind of paste or clay modify it into a variety of form and existences dissolve after a time each modification and from its substance erect a new form as the same material substance may successively compose the body of all animals the same spiritual substance may compose their mind their consciousness or that system of think which they form during life may be continually dissolve by death and nothing interest them in the new modification the most positive asserters of the mortality of the soul never deny the immortality of its substance and that an immaterial substance as well as a material may lose its memory or consciousness appear in part from experience if the soul be immaterial reason from the common course of nature and without suppose any new interposition of the supreme cause which ought always to be exclude from philosophy what be incorruptible must also be ingenerable the soul therefore if immortal exist before our birth and if the former state of existence no wise concern us neither will the latter animals undoubtedly feel think love hate will and even reason tho in a more imperfect manner than man be their souls also immaterial and immortal let us now consider the moral arguments chiefly those arguments derive from the justice of god which be suppose to be farther interest in the farther punishment of the vicious and reward of the virtuous but these arguments be ground on the supposition that god have attribute beyond what he have exert in this universe with which alone we be acquaint whence do we infer the existence of these attribute it be very safe for us to affirm that whatever we know the deity to have actually do be best but it be very dangerous to affirm that he must always do what to us seem best in how many instance would this reason fail us with regard to the present world but if any purpose of nature be clear we may affirm that the whole scope and intention of man creation so far as we can judge by natural reason be limit to the present life with how weak a concern from the original inherent structure of the mind and passions do he ever look farther what comparison either for steddiness or efficacy between so float an idea and the most doubtful persuasion of any matter of fact that occur in common life there arise indeed in some mind some unaccountable terrors with regard to futurity but these would quickly vanish be they not artificially foster by precept and education and those who foster them what be their motive only to gain a livelihood and to acquire power and riches in this world their very zeal and industry therefore be an argument against them what cruelty what iniquity what injustice in nature to confine thus all our concern as well as all our knowledge to the present life if there be another scene still await us of infinitely greater consequence ought this barbarous deceit to be ascribe to a beneficent and wise be observe with what exact proportion the task to be perform and the perform power be adjust throughout all nature if the reason of man give him a great superiority above other animals his necessities be proportionably multiply upon him his whole time his whole capacity activity courage passion find sufficient employment in fence against the miseries of his present condition and frequently nay almost always be too slender for the business assign them a pair of shoe perhaps be never yet work to the highest degree of perfection which that commodity be capable of attain yet be it necessary at least very useful that there should be some politicians and moralists even some geometers historians poets and philosophers among mankind the power of men be no more superior to their want consider merely in this life than those of fox and hare be compare to their want and to their period of existence the inference from parity of reason be therefore obvious on the theory of the souls mortality the inferiority of womens capacity be easily account for their domestic life require no higher faculties either of mind or body this circumstance vanish and become absolutely insignificant on the religious theory the one sex have an equal task to perform with the other their power of reason and resolution ought also to have be equal and both of them infinitely greater than at present as every effect imply a cause and that another till we reach the first cause of all which be the deity every thing that happen be ordain by him and nothing can be the object of his punishment or vengeance by what rule be punishments and reward distribute what be the divine standard of merit and demerit shall we suppose that human sentiments have place in the deity however bold that hypothesis we have no conception of any other sentiments accord to human sentiments sense courage good manners industry prudence genius c be essential part of personal merit shall we therefore erect an elysium for poets and heroes like that of the antient mythology why confine all reward to one species of virtue punishment without any proper end or purpose be inconsistent with our ideas of goodness and justice and no end can be serve by it after the whole scene be close punishment accord to our conceptions should bear some proportion to the offence why then eternal punishment for the temporary offences of so frail a creature as man can any one approve of alexanders rage who intend to exterminate a whole nation because they have seize his favourite horse bucephalus heaven and hell suppose two distinct species of men the good and the bad but the greatest part of mankind float between vice and virtue be one to go round the world with an intention of give a good supper to the righteous and a sound drub to the wicked he would frequently be embarrass in his choice and would find that the merit and demerits of most men and women scarcely amount to the value of either to suppose measure of approbation and blame different from the human confound every thing whence do we learn that there be such a thing as moral distinctions but from our own sentiments what man who have not meet with personal provocation or what good naturd man who have could inflict on crimes from the sense of blame alone even the common legal frivolous punishments and do any thing steel the breast of judge and juries against the sentiments of humanity but reflections on necessity and public interest by the roman law those who have be guilty of parricide and confess their crime be put into a sack along with an ape a dog and a serpent and throw into the river death alone be the punishment of those who deny their guilt however fully prove a criminal be try before augustus and condemn after full conviction but the humane emperor when he put the last interrogatory give it such a turn as to lead the wretch into a denial of his guilt you surely say the prince do not kill your father this lenity suit our natural ideas of right even towards the greatest of all criminals and even tho it prevent so inconsiderable a sufferance nay even the most bigotted priest would naturally without reflection approve of it provide the crime be not heresy or infidelity for as these crimes hurt himself in his temporal interest and advantage perhaps he may not be altogether so indulgent to them the chief source of moral ideas be the reflection on the interest of human society ought these interest so short so frivolous to be guard by punishments eternal and infinite the damnation of one man be an infinitely greater evil in the universe than the subversion of a thousand million of kingdoms nature have render human infancy peculiarly frail and mortal as it be on purpose to refute the notion of a probationary state the half of mankind dye before they be rational creatures the physical arguments from the analogy of nature be strong for the mortality of the soul and these be really the only philosophical arguments which ought to be admit with regard to this question or indeed any question of fact where any two object be so closely connect that all alterations which we have ever see in the one be attend with proportionable alterations in the other we ought to conclude by all rule of analogy that when there be still greater alterations produce in the former and it be totally dissolve there follow a total dissolution of the latter sleep a very small effect on the body be attend with a temporary extinction at least a great confusion in the soul the weakness of the body and that of the mind in infancy be exactly proportion their vigor in manhood their sympathetic disorder in sickness their common gradual decay in old age the step farther seem unavoidable their common dissolution in death the last symptoms which the mind discover be disorder weakness insensibility stupidity the forerunners of its annihilation the farther progress of the same cause encreasing the same effect totally extinguish it judge by the usual analogy of nature no form can continue when transfer to a condition of life very different from the original one in which it be place tree perish in the water fish in the air animals in the earth even so small a difference as that of climate be often fatal what reason then to imagine that an immense alteration such as be make on the soul by the dissolution of its body and all its organs of think and sensation can be effect without the dissolution of the whole every thing be in common between soul and body the organs of the one be all of them the organs of the other the existence therefore of the one must be dependent on that of the other the souls of animals be allow to be mortal and these bear so near a resemblance to the souls of men that the analogy from one to the other form a very strong argument their body be not more resemble yet no one reject the arguments draw from comparative anatomy the metempsychosis be therefore the only system

arise from some precede sensation or idea he divide the passions into the calm and the violent on occasion the term passion be use narrowly as in the present essay to designate only the more violent passions such as love and hatred grief and joy or pride and humility when hume speak here of a delicacy of passion he mean a disposition to be affect strongly by the violent passions in the face of prosperity or misfortune favor or injuries honor or slight and other accidents of life that lie beyond our control what he here call tastethe sense of beauty and deformity in action or objectsis also a passion broadly speak but normally a calm one a delicacy of taste be a keen sensitivity to beauty and deformity in action book work of art companion and such this quality of mind be discuss at considerable length by hume in essay of the standard of taste hume sometimes use the term sentiment broadly to mean passion or feel as such but at other time as in this passage he use it synonymously

suggest that governments be to be classify as republics monarchies or as in the case of great britain a mixture of republican and monarchical elements aristocracy and pure democracy would in this classification be type of republican government as would the representative system that hume describe in idea of a perfect commonwealth the distinction in the present essay between liberty and

contrary observation with regard to the manners of soldier take place in our days this seem to me a presumption that the ancients owe all their refinement and civility to book and study for which indeed a soldier life be not so well calculate company and the world be their sphere and if there be any politeness to be learn from company they will certainly have a considerable share of it though all mankind have a strong propensity to religion at certain time and in certain dispositions yet be there few or none who have it to that degree and with that constancy which be requisite to support the character of this profession it must therefore happen that clergymen be draw from the common mass of mankind as people be to other employments by the view of profit the greater part though no atheists or freethinkers will find it necessary on particular occasion to feign more devotion than they be at that time possess of and to maintain the appearance of fervor and seriousness even when jade with the exercise of their religion or when they have their mind engage in the common occupations of life they must not like the rest of the world give scope to their natural movements and sentiments they must set a guard over their look and word and action and in order to support the veneration pay them by the multitude they must not only keep a remarkable reserve but must promote the spirit of superstition by a continue grimace and hypocrisy this dissimulation often destroy the candor and ingenuity of their temper and make an irreparable breach in their character if by chance any of them be possess of a temper more susceptible of devotion than usual so that he have but little occasion for hypocrisy to support the character of his profession it be so natural for him to overrate this advantage and to think that it atone for every violation of morality that frequently he be not more virtuous than the hypocrite and though few dare openly avow those explode opinions that every thing be lawful to the saint and that they alone have property in their goods yet may we observe that these principles lurk in every bosom and represent a zeal for religious observances as so great a merit that it may compensate for many vices and enormities this observation be so common that all prudent men be on their guard when they meet with any extraordinary appearance of religion though at the same time they confess that there be many exceptions to this general rule and that probity and superstition or even probity and fanaticism be not altogether and in every instance incompatible most men be ambitious but the ambition of other men may commonly be satisfy by excel in their particular profession and thereby promote the interest of society the ambition of the clergy can often be satisfy only by promote ignorance and superstition and implicit faith and pious frauds and have get what archimedes only want namely another world on which he could fix his engines no wonder they move this world at their pleasure most men have an overweaning conceit of themselves but these have a peculiar temptation to that vice who be regard with such veneration and be even deem sacred by the ignorant multitude most men be apt to bear a particular regard for members of their own profession but as a lawyer or physician or merchant do each of them follow out his business apart the interest of men of these professions be not so closely unite as the interest of clergymen of the same religion where the whole body gain by the veneration pay to their common tenets and by the suppression of antagonists few men can bear contradiction with patience but the clergy too often proceed even to a degree of fury on this head because all their credit and livelihood depend upon the belief which their opinions meet with and they alone pretend to a divine and supernatural authority or have any colour for represent their antagonists as impious and prophane the odium theologicum or theological hatred be note even to a proverb and mean that degree of rancour which be the most furious and implacable revenge be a natural passion to mankind but seem to reign with the greatest force in priests and women because be deprive of the immediate exertion of anger in violence and combat they be apt to fancy themselves despise on that account and their pride support their vindictive dispositionb thus many of the vices of human nature be by fix moral cause inflame in that profession and though several individuals escape the contagion yet all wise governments will be on their guard against the attempt of a society who will for ever combine into one faction and while it act as a society will for ever be actuate by ambition pride revenge and a persecute spirit the temper of religion be grave and serious and this be the character require of priests which confine them to strict rule of decency and commonly prevent irregularity and intemperance amongst them the gaiety much less the excesses of pleasure be not permit in that body and this virtue be perhaps the only one which they owe to their profession in religions indeed found on speculative principles and where public discourse make a part of religious service it may also be suppose that the clergy will have a considerable share in the learn of the time though it be certain that their taste in eloquence will always be greater than their proficiency in reason and philosophy but whoever possess the other noble virtues of humanity meekness and moderation as very many of them no doubt do be behold for them to nature or reflection

estimate would be form that would bring us to admit that there have be no city in the whole world that could be compare to rome in magnitude loeb translation by h rackham the loeb latin text read pace which rackham translate as miles yards hume obviously follow a different manuscript tradition all the best manuscripts of pliny read the passage as here cite and fix the compass of the wall of rome to be thirteen miles the question be what pliny mean by pace and how that number be form the manner in which conceive it be this rome be a semicircular area of thirteen miles circumference the forum and consequently the milliarium we know be situate on the bank of the tyber and near the center of the circle or upon the diameter of the semicircular area though there be thirtyseven gate to rome yet only twelve of them have straight streets lead from them to the milliarium pliny therefore have assign the circumference of rome and know that that alone be not sufficient to give us a just notion of its surface use this farther method he suppose all the streets lead from the milliarium to the twelve gate to be lay together into one straight line and suppose we run along that line so as to count each gate once in which case he say that the whole line be pace or in other word that each street or radius of the semicircular area be upon an average two miles and a half and the whole length of rome be five miles and its breadth about half as much besides the scatter suburbs pere hardouin jean hardouin publish in an edition of plinys natural history which be reissue in and later with annotations understand this passage in the same manner with regard to the lay together the several streets of rome into one line in order to compose pace but then he suppose that streets lead from the milliarium to every gate and that no street exceed pace in length but a semicircular area whose radius be only pace could never have a circumference near thirteen miles the compass of rome as assign by pliny a radius of two miles and a half form very nearly that circumference there be an absurdity in suppose a city so build as to have streets run to its center from every gate in its circumference these streets must interfere as they approach this diminish too much from the greatness of ancient rome and reduce that city below even bristol or rotterdam the sense which vossius in his observationes variæ see note to this essay put on this passage of pliny err widely in the other extreme one manuscript of no authority instead of thirteen miles have assign thirty miles for the compass of the wall of rome and vossius understand this only of the curvilinear part of the circumference suppose that as the tyber form the diameter there be no wall build on that side but this read be allow to be contrary to almost all the manuscripts why should pliny a concise writer repeat the compass of the wall of rome in two successive sentence why repeat it with so sensible a variation what be the mean of plinys mention twice the milliarium if a line be measure that have no dependence on the milliarium aurelians wall be say by vopiscus to have be draw laxiore ambitu in a wider circuit and to have comprehend all the build and suburbs on the north side of the tyber yet its compass be only fifty miles and even here critics suspect some mistake or corruption in the text since the wall which remain and which be suppose to be the same with aurelians exceed not twelve miles it be not probable that rome would diminish from augustus to aurelian it remain still the capital of the same empire and none of the civil war in that long period except the tumults on the death of maximus and balbinus ever affect the city caracalla be say by aurelius victor sextus aurelius victor whose history of the caesars be publish around ad to have encreased rome there be no remain of ancient build which mark any such greatness of rome vossiuss reply to this objection seem absurd that the

if they be necessary destroy the foundation on which they be ground that rome contain fourteen millions of inhabitants while the whole kingdom of france contain only five accord to his computation c the only objection to the sense which we have affix above to the passage of pliny seem to lie in this that pliny after mention the thirtyseven gate of rome assign only a reason for suppress the seven old ones and say nothing of the eighteen gate the streets lead from which terminate accord to my opinion before they reach the forum but as pliny be write to the romans who perfectly know the disposition of the streets it be not strange he should take a circumstance for grant which be so familiar to every body perhaps too many of these gate lead to wharf upon the river ex monument ancyr

the visionary systems or rave of plato than the plain sense of plutarch there run also through the whole an air of superstition and credulity which resemble very little the spirit that appear in other philosophical compositions of that author for it be remarkable that though plutarch be an historian as superstitious as herodotus or livy yet there be scarcely in all antiquity a philosopher less superstitious except cicero and lucian must therefore confess that a passage of plutarch cite from this discourse have much less authority with me than if it have be find in most of his other

hume consistently place justice fidelity to promise and allegiance to government in a different category from those virtues that we perform and approve by an original instinct of nature in the treatise he present the division as one between natural and artificial virtues but he retreat somewhat from this terminology in the second enquiry see appendix thus in the present essay justice fidelity and allegiance which have be classify as artificial duties in the treatise be call natural duties hume will argue against locke that it be inappropriate to base allegiance or the obligation to obey rulers on a prior obligation to keep promise since both obligations arise from the same foundation this argument draw heavily on book part of the treatise this brief discussion of the grind of

such a liberty be advantageous or prejudicial there be nothing of greater importance in every state than the preservation of the ancient government especially if it be a free one but would fain go a step farther and assert that this liberty be attend with so few inconveniencies that it may be claim as the common right of mankind and ought to be indulge them almost in every government except the ecclesiastical to which indeed it would prove fatal we need not dread from this liberty any such ill consequences as follow from the harangue of the popular demagogues of athens and tribunes of rome a man read a book or pamphlet alone and coolly there be none present from whom he can catch the passion by contagion he be not hurry away by the force and energy of action and should he be work up to ever so seditious a humour there be no violent resolution present to him by which he can immediately vent his passion the liberty of the press therefore however abuse can scarce ever excite popular tumults or rebellion and as to those murmur or secret discontent it may occasion tis better they should get vent in word that they may come to the knowledge of the magistrate before it be too late in order to his provide a remedy against them mankind it be true have always a greater propension to believe what be say to the disadvantage of their governors than the contrary but this inclination be inseparable from them whether they have liberty or not a whisper may fly as quick and be as pernicious as a pamphlet nay it will be more pernicious where men be not accustom to think freely or distinguish between truth and falshood it have also be find as the experience of mankind increase that the people be no such dangerous monster as they have be represent and that it be in every respect better to guide them like rational creatures than to lead or drive them like brute beasts before the unite provinces set the example toleration be deem incompatible with good government and it be think impossible that a number of religious sects could live together in harmony and peace and have all of them an equal affection to their common country and to each other england have set a like example of civil liberty and though this liberty seem to occasion some small ferment at present it have not as yet produce any pernicious effect and it be to be hop that men be every day more accustom to the free discussion of public affairs will improve in the judgment of them and be with greater difficulty seduce by every idle rumour and popular clamour it be a very comfortable reflection to the lovers of liberty that this peculiar privilege of britain be of a kind that can not easily be wrest from us but must last as long as our government remain in any degree free and independent it be seldom that liberty of any kind be lose all at once slavery have so frightful an aspect to men accustom to freedom that it must steal upon them by degrees and must disguise itself in a thousand shape in order to be receive but if the liberty of the press ever be lose it must be lose at once the general laws against sedition and libel be at present as strong as they possibly can be make nothing can impose a farther restraint but either the clap an imprimatur upon the press or the give to the court very large discretionary power to punish whatever displease them but these concessions would be such a barefaced violation of liberty that they will probably be the last efforts of a despotic government we may conclude that the liberty of britain be go for ever when these attempt shall succeed

editions a and b omit the remainder of the paragraph beditions a to n add the follow paragraphi shall conclude this subject with observe that the present political controversy with regard to instructions be a very frivolous one and can never be bring to any decision as it be manage by both party the countryparty pretend not that a member be absolutely bind to follow instructions as an ambassador or general be confine by his order and that his vote be not to be receive in the house but so far as it be conformable to them the courtparty again pretend not that the sentiments of the people ought to have no weight with every member much less that he ought to despise the sentiments of those he represent and with whom he be more particularly connect and if their sentiments be of weight why ought they not to express these sentiments the question then be only concern the degrees of weight which ought to be placd on instructions but such be the nature of language that it be impossible for it to express distinctly these different degrees and if men will carry on a controversy on this head it may well happen that they differ in their language and yet agree in their sentiments or differ in their sentiments and yet agree in their language besides how be it possible to find these degrees consider the variety of affairs which come before the house and the variety of place which members represent ought the instructions of totness to have the same weight as those of london or instructions with regard to the convention which respect foreign politics to have the same weight as those with regard to the excise which respect only our domestic affairs ain editions a to n this essay be introduce by the follow examination of the spirit of party have frequently observe in compare the conduct of the court and country party that the former be commonly less assume and dogmatical in conversation more apt to make concessions and tho not perhaps more susceptible of conviction yet more able to bear contradiction than the latter who be apt to fly out upon any opposition and to regard one as a mercenary design fellow if he argue with any coolness and impartiality or make any concessions to their adversaries this be a fact which believe every one may have observe who have be much in company where political question have be discuss tho be one to ask the reason of this difference every party would be apt to assign a different reason gentlemen in the opposition will ascribe it to the very nature of their party which be found on public spirit and a zeal for the constitution can not easily endure such doctrines as be of pernicious consequence to liberty the courtiers on the other hand will be apt to put us in mind of the clown mention by lord shaftsbury a clown say that excellent author once take a fancy to hear the latin dispute of doctor at an university he be ask what pleasure he could take in view such combatants when he could never know so much as which of the party have the better for that matter reply the clown ant such a fool neither but can see whos the first that put tother into a passion nature herself dictate this lesson to the clown that he who have the better of the argument would be easy and wellhumoured but he who be unable to support his cause by reason would naturally lose his temper and grow violent to which of these reason shall we adhere to neither of them in my opinion unless we have a mind to enlist ourselves and become zealots in either party believe can assign the reason of this different conduct of the two party without offend either the country party be plainly most popular at present and perhaps have be so in most administrations so that be accustom to prevail in company they can not endure to hear their opinions controvert but be as confident on the public favour as if they be support in all their sentiments by the most infallible demonstration the courtiers on the other hand be commonly so run down by popular talkers that if you speak to them with any moderation or make them the smallest concessions they think themselves extremely behold to you and be apt to return the favour by a like moderation and facility on their part to be furious and passionate they know would only gain them the character of shameless mercenaries not that of zealous patriots which be the character that such a warm behaviour be apt to acquire to the other party in all controversies we find without regard the truth or falshood on either side that those who defend the establish and popular opinions be always the most dogmatical and imperious in their stile while their adversaries affect almost extraordinary gentleness and moderation in order to soften as much as possible any prejudice that may lye against them consider the behavior of our freethinkers of all denominations whether they be such as decry all revelation or only oppose the exorbitant power of the clergy collins tindal foster hoadley compare their moderation and good manners with the furious zeal and scurrility of their adversaries and you will be convince of the truth of my observation a like difference may be observe in the conduct of those french writers who maintain the controversy with regard to ancient and modern learn boileau monsieur and madame dacier labbé de bos who defend the party of the ancients mix their reason with satire and invective while fontenelle la motte charpentier and even perrault never transgress the bound of moderation and good breed though provoke by the most injurious treatment of their adversaries must however observe that this remark with regard to the seem moderation of the court party be entirely confind to conversation and to gentlemen who have be engagd by interest or inclination in that party for as to the courtwriters be commonly hird scriblers they be altogether as scurrilous as the mercenaries of the other party nor have the gazeteer any advantage in this respect above common sense a man of education will in any party discover himself to be such by his goodbreeding and decency as a scoundrel will always betray the opposite qualities the false accusers accusd c be very

into an ænigma and be indeed so contrary to the strongest evidence that a man must have a great opinion of his own eloquence to attempt the prove of ita and b shall first mention as a proof of a real distinction between these party what every one may have observe or hear concern the conduct and conversation of all his friends and acquaintance on both side have not the tories always bear an avow affection to the family of stuart and have not their adversaries always oppose with vigour the succession of that family the tory principles be confessedly the most favourable to monarchy yet the tories have amost always oppose the court these fifty years nor be they cordial friends to king william even when employ by him their quarrel therefore can not be suppose to have lie with the throne but with the person who sit on it they concur heartily with the court during the four last years of queen anne but be any one at a loss to find the reason the succession of the crown in the british government be a point of too great consequence to be absolutely indifferent to persons who concern themselves in any degree about the fortune of the public much less can it be suppose that the tory party who never value themselves upon moderation could maintain a stoical indifference in a point of such importance be they therefore zealous for the house of hanover or be there any thing that keep an opposite zeal from openly appear if it do not openly appear but prudence and a sense of decency this paragraph be not in a and b tis monstrous to see an establish episcopal clergy in declare opposition to the court and a nonconformist presbyterian clergy in conjunction with it what could have produce such an unnatural conduct in both nothing but that the former espouse monarchical principles too high for the present settlement which be found on principles of liberty and the latter be afraid of the prevalence of those high principles adhere to that party from whom they have reason to expect liberty and toleration the different conduct of the two party with regard to foreign politics be also a proof to the same purpose holland have always be most favour by one and france by the other in short the proof of this kind seem so palpable and evident that tis almost needle to collect them kso the essay conclude in editions q and r in place of the last paragraph the precede editions read as follow tis however remarkable that tho the principles of whig and tory be both of them of a compound nature yet the ingredients which predominate in both be not correspondent to each other a tory love monarchy and bore an affection to the family of stuart but the latter affection be the predominant inclination of the party a whig love liberty and be a friend to the settlement in the protestant line but the love of liberty be professedly his predominant inclination the tories have frequently act as republicans where either policy or revenge have engage them to that conduct and there be no one of that party who upon the supposition that he be to be disappoint in his view with regard to the succession would not have desire to impose the strictest limitations on the crown and to bring our form of government as near republican as possible in order to depress the family which accord to his apprehension succeed without any just title the whigs tis true have also take step dangerous to liberty under colour of secure the succession and settlement of the crown accord to their view but as the body of the party have no passion for that succession otherwise than as the mean of secure liberty they have be betray into these step by ignorance or frailty or the interest of their leaders the succession of the crown be therefore the chief point with the tories the security of our liberties with the whigs the remainder of this paragraph be not in a and b nor be this seem irregularity at all difficult to be account for by our present theory court and country party be the true parent of tory and whig but tis almost impossible that the attachment of the court party to monarchy should not degenerate into an attachment to the monarch there be so close a connexion between them and the latter be so much the more natural object how easily do the worship of the divinity degenerate into a worship of the idol the connexion be not so great between liberty the divinity of the old country party or whigs and any monarch or royal family nor be it so reasonable to suppose that in that party the worship can be so easily transfer from the one to the other tho even that would be no great miracle tis difficult to penetrate into the thoughts and sentiments of any particular man but tis almost impossible to distinguish those of a whole party where it often happen that no two persons agree precisely in the same maxims of conduct yet will venture to affirm that it be not so much principle or an opinion of indefeasible right which attach the tories to the ancient royal family as affection or a certain love and esteem for their persons the same cause divide england formerly between the house of york and lancaster and scotland between the families of bruce and baliol in an age when political dispute be but little in fashion and when political principles must of course have have but little influence on mankind the doctrine of passive obedience be so absurd in itself and so opposite to our liberties that it seem to have be chiefly leave to pulpitdeclaimers and to their delude followers among the vulgar men of better sense be guide by affection and as to the leaders of this party tis probable that interest be their chief motive and that they act more contrary to their private sentiments than the leaders of the opposite party the remainder of this paragraph be not in a and b tho tis almost impossible to maintain with zeal the right of any person or family without acquire a goodwill to them and change the principle into affection yet this be less natural to people of an elevate station and liberal education who have have full opportunity of observe the weakness folly and arrogance of monarchs and have find them to be nothing superior if not rather inferior to the rest of mankind the interest therefore of be head of a party do often with such people supply the place both of principle and affection some who will not venture to assert that the real difference between whig and tory be lose at the revolution seem incline to think that the difference be now abolish and that affairs be so far return to their natural state that there be at present no other party amongst us but court and country that be men who by interest or principle be attach either to monarchy or to liberty it must indeed be confest that the tory party seem of late to have decay much in their number still more in their zeal and may venture to say still more in their credit and authority there be few men of knowledge or learn at least few philosophers since mr locke have write who would not be ashamed to be think of that party and in almost all company the name of old whig be mention as an uncontestable appellation of honour and dignity accordingly the enemies of the ministry as a reproach call the courtiers the true tories and as an honour denominate the gentlemen in the opposition the true whigs the last two sentence be omit in p a and b read no man omit at least write the tories have be so long oblige to talk in the republican stile that they seem to have make convert of themselves by their hypocrisy and to have embrace the sentiments as well as language of their adversaries there be however very considerable remain of that party in england with all their old prejudice and a proof that court and country be not our only party be that almost all the dissenters side with the court and the lower clergy at least of the church of england with the opposition this may convince us that some bias still hang upon our constitution some intrinsic weight which turn it from its natural course and cause a confusion in our party this sentence do not occur in a shall conclude this subject with observe that we never have any tories in scotland accord to the proper signification of the word and that the division of party in this country be really into whigs and jacobites a jacobite seem to be a tory who have no regard to the constitution but be either a zealous partizan of absolute monarchy or at least will to sacrifice our liberties to the obtain the succession in that family to which he be attach the reason of the difference between england and scotland take to be this political and religious divisions in the latter country have be since the revolution regularly correspondent to each other the presbyterians be all whigs without exception those who favour episcopacy of the opposite party and as the clergy of the latter sect be turn out of the church at the revolution they have no motive for make any compliances with the government in their oaths or their form of prayers but openly avow the highest principles of their party which be the cause why their followers have be more violent than their brethren of the tory party in england as violent things have not commonly so long a duration as moderate we actually find that the jacobite party be almost entirely vanishd from among us and that the distinction of court and country which be but creep in at london be the only one that be ever mentiond in this kingdom beside the violence and openness of the jacobite party another reason have perhaps contribute to produce so sudden and so visible an alteration in this part of britain there be only two rank of men among us gentlemen who have some fortune and education and the meanest slave poor without any considerable number of that middle rank of men which abound more in england both in cities and in the country than in any other part of the world the slave poor be incapable of any principles gentlemen may be convert to true principles by time and experience the middle rank of men have curiosity and knowledge enough to form principles but not enough to form true ones or correct any prejudice that they may have imbibd and tis among the middle rank that tory principles do at present prevail most in england this final paragraph appear only in a and b lthis note do not occur in any edition prior to the final sentence of the note be add in q and r ain editions a and b this and the three next paragraph be write as follow my first reflection be that religions which partake of enthusiasm be on their first rise much more furious and violent than those which partake of superstition but in a little time become much more gentle and moderate the violence of this species of religion when excite by novelty and animate by opposition appear from numberless instance of the anabaptists in germany the camisars in france the levellers and other fanaticks in england and the covenanters in scotland as enthusiasm be found on strong spirit and a presumptuous boldness of character it naturally beget the most extreme resolutions especially after it rise to that height as to inspire the delude fanaticks with the opinion of divine illuminations and with a contempt of the common rule of reason morality and prudence tis thus enthusiasm produce the most cruel desolation in human society but its fury be like that of thunder and tempest which exhaust themselves in a little time and leave the air more calm and serene than before the reason of this will appear evidently by compare enthusiasm to superstition the other species of false religion and trace the natural consequences of each as superstition be found on fear sorrow and a depression of spirit it represent the person to himself in such despicable colour that he appear unworthy in his own eye of approach the divine presence and naturally have recourse to any other person whose sanctity of life or perhaps impudence and cunning have make him be suppose to be more favour by the divinity to him they entrust their devotions to his care they recommend their prayers petition and sacrifice and by his mean hope to render their address acceptable to their incense deity hence the origin of priests who may justly be regard as one of the grossest inventions of a timorous and abject superstition which ever diffident of itself dare not offer up its own devotions but ignorantly think to recommend itself to the divinity by the mediation of his suppose friends and servants as superstition be a considerable ingredient of almost all religions even the most fanatical there be nothing but philosophy able to conquer entirely these unaccountable terrors hence it proceed that in almost every sect of religion there be priests to be find but the stronger mixture there be of superstition the higher be the authority of the priesthood modern judaism and popery especially the latter be the most barbarous and absurd superstitions that have yet be know in the world be the most enslavd by their priests as the church of england may justly be say to retain a strong mixture of popish superstition it partake also in its original constitution of a propensity to priestly power and dominion particularly in the respect it exact to the priest and though accord to the sentiments of that church the prayers of the priest must be accompany with those of the laity yet be he the mouth of the congregation his person be sacred and without his presence few would think their public devotions or the sacraments and other rites acceptable to the divinity on the other hand it may be observe that all enthusiasts have be free from the yoke of ecclesiastics and have exprest a great independence in their devotion with a contempt of form tradition and authorities the quakers be the most egregious tho at the same time the most innocent enthusiasts that have be yet know and be perhaps the only sect that have never admit priests among them the independents of all the english sectaries approach nearest to the quakers in fanaticism and in their freedom from priestly bondage the presbyterians follow after at an equal distance in both these particulars in short this observation be found on the most certain experience and will also appear to be found on reason if we consider that as enthusiasm arise from a presumptuous pride and confidence it think itself sufficiently qualify to approach the divinity without any human mediator its rapturous devotions be so fervent that it even imagine itself actually to approach him by the way of contemplation and inward converse which make it neglect all those outward ceremonies and observances to which the assistance of the priests appear so requisite in the eye of their superstitious votaries the fanatick consecrate himself and bestow on his own person a sacred character much superior to what form and ceremonious institutions can confer on any other tis therefore an infallible rule that superstition be favourable to priestly power and euthusiasm as much or rather more contrary to it than sound reason and philosophy the consequences be evident when the first fire of enthusiasm be spend men naturally in such fanatical sects sink into the greatest remissness and coolness in sacred matter there be no body of men amongst them endowd with sufficient authority whose interest be concern to support the religious spirit superstition on the contrary steal in gradually and insensibly render men tame and submissive be acceptable to the magistrate and seem inoffensive to the people till at last the priest have firmly establishd his authority become the tyrant and disturber of human society by his endless contentions persecutions and religious war how smoothly do the romish church advance in their acquisition of power but into what dismal convulsions do they throw all europe in order to maintain it on the other hand our sectaries who be formerly such dangerous bigots be now become our greatest freethinkers and the quakers be perhaps the only regular body of deists in the universe except the literati or disciples of confucius in china bthe follow note be append in editions to n by priests here mean only the pretenders to power and dominion and to a superior sanctity of character distinct from virtue and good morals these be very different from clergymen who be set apart by the laws to the care of sacred matter and to the conduct our public devotions with greater decency and order there be no rank of men more to be respect than the latter cas one of the grossest inventions to n dhere to p add modern judaism and popery especially the latter be the most unphilosophical and absurd superstitions which have yet be know in the world be the most enslave by their priests as the church of england may justly be say to retain some mixture of popish supersitition it partake also in its original constitution of a propensity to priestly power and dominion particularly in the respect it exact to the sacerdotal character and though accord to the sentiments of that church the prayers of the priest must be accompany with those of the laity yet be he the mouth of the congregation his person be sacred and without his presence few would think their public devotions or the sacraments and other rites acceptable to the divinity

have confest that there be something accidental in the origin and progress of the arts in any nation and yet can not forbear think that if the other learn and polite nations of europe have possest the same advantage of a popular government they would probably have carry eloquence to a greater height than it have yet reach in britain the french sermons especially those of flechier and bossuet be much superior to the english in this particular and in both these author be find many stroke of the most sublime poetry and and in flechier there be find many stroke of the most sublime poetry his funeral sermon on the marechal de turenne be a good instance none but private cause in that country be ever debate before their parliaments or court of judicature but notwithstanding this disadvantage there appear a spirit of eloquence in many of their lawyers which with proper cultivation and encouragement might rise to the greatest height the plead of patru be very elegant and give us room to imagine what so fine a genius could have perform in question concern public liberty or slavery peace or war who exert himself with such success in debate concern the price of an old horse or a gossip story of a quarrel between an abbess and her nuns for tis remarkable that this polite writer tho esteem by all the men of wit in his time be never employ in the most considerable cause of their court

factions against cardinal mazarine make the parliament of paris enter into the discussion of public affairs and during that short interval there appear many symptoms of the revival of ancient eloquence the avocat generaltalon in an oration invoke on his knees the spirit of st louis to look down with compassion on his divide and unhappy people and to inspire them from above with the love of concord and unanimity the members of the french academy have attempt to give us model of eloquence in their harangue at their admittance but have no subject to discourse upon they have run altogether into a fulsome strain of panegyric and flattery the most barren of all subject their stile however be commonly on these occasion very elevate and sublime and might reach the greatest heights be it employ on a subject more favourable and engage there be some circumstances confess in the english temper and genius which be disadvantageous to the progress of eloquence and render all attempt of that kind more dangerous and difficult among them than among any other nation the english be conspicuous for goodsense which make them very jealous of any attempt to deceive them by the flower of rhetoric and elocution they be also peculiarly modest which make them consider it as a piece of arrogance to offer any thing but reason to public assemblies or attempt to guide them by passion or fancy may perhaps be allow to add that the people in general be not remarkable for delicacy of taste or for sensibility to the charm of the muse their musical part to use the expression of a noble author be but indifferent hence their comic poets to move them must have recourse to obscenity their tragic poets to blood and slaughter and hence their orators be deprive of any such resource have abandon altogether the hop of move them and have confine themselves to plain argument and reason these circumstances join to particular accidents may perhaps have retard the growth of eloquence in this kingdom but will not be able to prevent its success if ever it appear amongst us and one may safely pronounce that this be a field in which the most flourish laurels may yet be gather if any youth of accomplish genius thoroughly acquaint with all the polite arts and not ignorant of public business should appear in parliament and accustom our ears to an eloquence more command and pathetic and to

the first age of the roman history as if they be almost entirely fabulous till after the sack of the city by the gauls and be even doubtful for some time afterwards till the greeks begin to give attention to roman affairs and commit them to write this scepticism however seem to me scarcely defensible in its full extent with regard to the domestic history of rome which have some air of truth and probability and coud scarce be the invention of an historian who have so little morals or judgment as to indulge himself in fiction and romance the revolutions seem so well proportiond to their

improvement be not machiavels comment on livy a work surely of great judgment and genius found entirely on this period which be represent as fabulous woud willingly therefore in my private sentiments divide the matter with these critics and allow that the battle and victories and triumph of those age have be extremely falsifyd by family memoirs as cicero say they be but as in the account of domestic factions there be two opposite relations transmit to posterity this both servd as a check upon fiction and enable latter historians to gather some truth from comparison and reason half of the slaughter which livy commit on the æqui and the volsci would depopulate france and germany and that historian tho perhaps he may be justly charge as superficial be at last shockd himself with the

ambitious nation in the five last general war have be victorious in four and unsuccessful only in one they have not much enlarge their dominions nor acquire a total ascendant over europe there remain rather room to hope that by maintain the resistance for some time the natural revolutions of human affairs together with unforeseen events and accidents may guard us against universal monarchy and preserve the world from so great an evil in the three last of these general war britain have stand foremost in the glorious struggle and she still maintain her station as guardian of the general

beware of the abuse exorbitant tax like extreme necessity destroy industry by produce despair and even before they reach this pitch they raise the wag of the labourer and manufacturer and heighten the price of all commodities an attentive disinterested legislature will observe the point when the emolument cease and the prejudice begin but as the contrary character be much more common tis to be fear

there any parallel to be draw from the circulation of other commodities to that of chequernotes and india bond where a manufacturer have a quick sale of his goods to the merchant the merchant to the shopkeeper the shopkeeper to his customers this enliven industry and give new encouragement to the first dealer or the manufacturer and all his tradesmen and make them produce more and better commodities of the same species a stagnation be here pernicious wherever it happen because it operate backwards and stop or benumb the industrious hand in its production of what be useful to human

and a more dangerous influence than when it arise from a great increase of gold and silver where an accidental overflow of money raise the price of labor and commodities the evil remedy itself in a

the note in time of peace and security when alone it be possible to pay debt the monied interest be averse to receive partial payments which they know not how to dispose of to advantage and the land

could we practise either of these methods we need never be oppress by the national debt and it be not impossible but one of these or some other method may at all adventure be try on the augmentation

with something spurious not genuine ain editions a to n this essay be introduce by the follow examination of the spirit of party have frequently observe in compare the conduct of the court and country party that the former be commonly less assume and dogmatical in conversation more apt to make concessions and tho not perhaps more susceptible of conviction yet more able to bear contradiction than the latter who be apt to fly out upon any opposition and to regard one as a mercenary design fellow if he argue with any coolness and impartiality or make any concessions to their adversaries this be a fact which believe every one may have observe who have be much in company where political question have be discuss tho be one to ask the reason of this difference every party would be apt to assign a different reason gentlemen in the opposition will ascribe it to the very nature of their party which be found on public spirit and a zeal for the constitution can not easily endure such doctrines as be of pernicious consequence to liberty the courtiers on the other hand will be apt to put us in mind of the clown mention by lord shaftsbury a clown say that excellent author once take a fancy to hear the latin dispute of doctor at an university he be ask what pleasure he could take in view such combatants when he could never know so much as which of the party have the better for that matter reply the clown ant such a fool neither but can see whos the first that put tother into a passion nature herself dictate this lesson to the clown that he who have the better of the argument would be easy and wellhumoured but he who be unable to support his cause by reason would naturally lose his temper and grow violent to which of these reason shall we adhere to neither of them in my opinion unless we have a mind to enlist ourselves and become zealots in either party believe can assign the reason of this different conduct of the two party without offend either the country party be plainly most popular at present and perhaps have be so in most administrations so that be accustom to prevail in company they can not endure to hear their opinions controvert but be as confident on the public favour as if they be support in all their sentiments by the most infallible demonstration the courtiers on the other hand be commonly so run down by popular talkers that if you speak to them with any moderation or make them the smallest concessions they think themselves extremely behold to you and be apt to return the favour by a like moderation and facility on their part to be furious and passionate they know would only gain them the character of shameless mercenaries not that of zealous patriots which be the character that such a warm behaviour be apt to acquire to the other party in all controversies we find without regard the truth or falshood on either side that those who defend the establish and popular opinions be always the most dogmatical and imperious in their stile while their adversaries affect almost extraordinary gentleness and moderation in order to soften as much as possible any prejudice that may lye against them consider the behavior of our freethinkers of all denominations whether they be such as decry all revelation or only oppose the exorbitant power of the clergy collins tindal foster hoadley compare their moderation and good manners with the furious zeal and scurrility of their adversaries and you will be convince of the truth of my observation a like difference may be observe in the conduct of those french writers who maintain the controversy with regard to ancient and modern learn boileau monsieur and madame dacier labbé de bos who defend the party of the ancients mix their reason with satire and invective while fontenelle la motte charpentier and even perrault never transgress the bound of moderation and good breed though provoke by the most injurious treatment of their adversaries must however observe that this remark with regard to the seem moderation of the court party be entirely confind to conversation and to gentlemen who have be engagd by interest or inclination in that party for as to the courtwriters be commonly hird scriblers they be altogether as scurrilous as the mercenaries of the other party nor have the gazeteer any advantage in this respect above common sense a man of education will in any party discover himself to be such by his goodbreeding and decency as a scoundrel will always betray the opposite qualities the false accusers accusd c be very scurrillous tho that side of the question be least popular shoud be defend with most moderation when ld be ld mt mr ln take the pen in hand tho they write with warmth they presume not upon their popularity so far as to transgress the bound of decency this paragraph be find only in editions a and b be lead into this train of reflection by consider some paper write upon that grand topic of court influence and parliamentary dependence where in my humble opinion the country party besides vehemence and satyre shew too rigid an inflexibility and too great a jealousy of make concessions to their adversaries their reason lose their force by be carry too far and the popularity of their opinions have seduce them to neglect in some measure their justness and solidity the follow reason will hope serve to justify me in this opinion kso the essay conclude in editions q and r in place of the last paragraph the precede editions read as follow tis however remarkable that tho the principles of whig and tory be both of them of a compound nature yet the ingredients which predominate in both be not correspondent to each other a tory love monarchy and bore an affection to the family of stuart but the latter affection be the predominant inclination of the party a whig love liberty and be a friend to the settlement in the protestant line but the love of liberty be professedly his predominant inclination the tories have frequently act as republicans where either policy or revenge have engage them to that conduct and there be no one of that party who upon the supposition that he be to be disappoint in his view with regard to the succession would not have desire to impose the strictest limitations on the crown and to bring our form of government as near republican as possible in order to depress the family which accord to his apprehension succeed without any just title the whigs tis true have also take step dangerous to liberty under colour of secure the succession and settlement of the crown accord to their view but as the body of the party have no passion for that succession otherwise than as the mean of secure liberty they have be betray into these step by ignorance or frailty or the interest of their leaders the succession of the crown be therefore the chief point with the tories the security of our liberties with the whigs the remainder of this paragraph be not in a and b nor be this seem irregularity at all difficult to be account for by our present theory court and country party be the true parent of tory and whig but tis almost impossible that the attachment of the court party to monarchy should not degenerate into an attachment to the monarch there be so close a connexion between them and the latter be so much the more natural object how easily do the worship of the divinity degenerate into a worship of the idol the connexion be not so great between liberty the divinity of the old country party or whigs and any monarch or royal family nor be it so reasonable to suppose that in that party the worship can be so easily transfer from the one to the other tho even that would be no great miracle tis difficult to penetrate into the thoughts and sentiments of any particular man but tis almost impossible to distinguish those of a whole party where it often happen that no two persons agree precisely in the same maxims of conduct yet will venture to affirm that it be not so much principle or an opinion of indefeasible right which attach the tories to the ancient royal family as affection or a certain love and esteem for their persons the same cause divide england formerly between the house of york and lancaster and scotland between the families of bruce and baliol in an age when political dispute be but little in fashion and when political principles must of course have have but little influence on mankind the doctrine of passive obedience be so absurd in itself and so opposite to our liberties that it seem to have be chiefly leave to pulpitdeclaimers and to their delude followers among the vulgar men of better sense be guide by affection and as to the leaders of this party tis probable that interest be their chief motive and that they act more contrary to their private sentiments than the leaders of the opposite party the remainder of this paragraph be not in a and b tho tis almost impossible to maintain with zeal the right of any person or family without acquire a goodwill to them and change the principle into affection yet this be less natural to people of an elevate station and liberal education who have have full opportunity of observe the weakness folly and arrogance of monarchs and have find them to be nothing superior if not rather inferior to the rest of mankind the interest therefore of be head of a party do often with such people supply the place both of principle and affection some who will not venture to assert that the real difference between whig and tory be lose at the revolution seem incline to think that the difference be now abolish and that affairs be so far return to their natural state that there be at present no other party amongst us but court and country that be men who by interest or principle be attach either to monarchy or to liberty it must indeed be confest that the tory party seem of late to have decay much in their number still more in their zeal and may venture to say still more in their credit and authority there be few men of knowledge or learn at least few philosophers since mr locke have write who would not be ashamed to be think of that party and in almost all company the name of old whig be mention as an uncontestable appellation of honour and dignity accordingly the enemies of the ministry as a reproach call the courtiers the true tories and as an honour denominate the gentlemen in the opposition the true whigs the last two sentence be omit in p a and b read no man omit at least write the tories have be so long oblige to talk in the republican stile that they seem to have make convert of themselves by their hypocrisy and to have embrace the sentiments as well as language of their adversaries there be however very considerable remain of that party in england with all their old prejudice and a proof that court and country be not our only party be that almost all the dissenters side with the court and the lower clergy at least of the church of england with the opposition this may convince us that some bias still hang upon our constitution some intrinsic weight which turn it from its natural course and cause a confusion in our party this sentence do not occur in a shall conclude this subject with observe that we never have any tories in scotland accord to the proper signification of the word and that the division of party in this country be really into whigs and jacobites a jacobite seem to be a tory who have no regard to the constitution but be either a zealous partizan of absolute monarchy or at least will to sacrifice our liberties to the obtain the succession in that family to which he be attach the reason of the difference between england and scotland take to be this political and religious divisions in the latter country have be since the revolution regularly correspondent to each other the presbyterians be all whigs without exception those who favour episcopacy of the opposite party and as the clergy of the latter sect be turn out of the church at the revolution they have no motive for make any compliances with the government in their oaths or their form of prayers but openly avow the highest principles of their party which be the cause why their followers have be more violent than their brethren of the tory party in england as violent things have not commonly so long a duration as moderate we actually find that the jacobite party be almost entirely vanishd from among us and that the distinction of court and country which be but creep in at london be the only one that be ever mentiond in this kingdom beside the violence and openness of the jacobite party another reason have perhaps contribute to produce so sudden and so visible an alteration in this part of britain there be only two rank of men among us gentlemen who have some fortune and education and the meanest slave poor without any considerable number of that middle rank of men which abound more in england both in cities and in the country than in any other part of the world the slave poor be incapable of any principles gentlemen may be convert to true principles by time and experience the middle rank of men have curiosity and knowledge enough to form principles but not enough to form true ones or correct any prejudice that they may have imbibd and tis among the middle rank that tory principles do at present prevail most in england this final paragraph appear only in a and b ain editions a and b this and the three next paragraph be write as follow my first reflection be that religions which partake of enthusiasm be on their first rise much more furious and violent than those which partake of superstition but in a little time become much more gentle and moderate the violence of this species of religion when excite by novelty and animate by opposition appear from numberless instance of the anabaptists in germany the camisars in france the levellers and other fanaticks in england and the covenanters in scotland as enthusiasm be found on strong spirit and a presumptuous boldness of character it naturally beget the most extreme resolutions especially after it rise to that height as to inspire the delude fanaticks with the opinion of divine illuminations and with a contempt of the common rule of reason morality and prudence tis thus enthusiasm produce the most cruel desolation in human society but its fury be like that of thunder and tempest which exhaust themselves in a little time and leave the air more calm and serene than before the reason of this will appear evidently by compare enthusiasm to superstition the other species of false religion and trace the natural consequences of each as superstition be found on fear sorrow and a depression of spirit it represent the person to himself in such despicable colour that he appear unworthy in his own eye of approach the divine presence and naturally have recourse to any other person whose sanctity of life or perhaps impudence and cunning have make him be suppose to be more favour by the divinity to him they entrust their devotions to his care they recommend their prayers petition and sacrifice and by his mean hope to render their address acceptable to their incense deity hence the origin of priests who may justly be regard as one of the grossest inventions of a timorous and abject superstition which ever diffident of itself dare not offer up its own devotions but ignorantly think to recommend itself to the divinity by the mediation of his suppose friends and servants as superstition be a considerable ingredient of almost all religions even the most fanatical there be nothing but philosophy able to conquer entirely these unaccountable terrors hence it proceed that in almost every sect of religion there be priests to be find but the stronger mixture there be of superstition the higher be the authority of the priesthood modern judaism and popery especially the latter be the most barbarous and absurd superstitions that have yet be know in the world be the most enslavd by their priests as the church of england may justly be say to retain a strong mixture of popish superstition it partake also in its original constitution of a propensity to priestly power and dominion particularly in the respect it exact to the priest and though accord to the sentiments of that church the prayers of the priest must be accompany with those of the laity yet be he the mouth of the congregation his person be sacred and without his presence few would think their public devotions or the sacraments and other rites acceptable to the divinity on the other hand it may be observe that all enthusiasts have be free from the yoke of ecclesiastics and have exprest a great independence in their devotion with a contempt of form tradition and authorities the quakers be the most egregious tho at the same time the most innocent enthusiasts that have be yet know and be perhaps the only sect that have never admit priests among them the independents of all the english sectaries approach nearest to the quakers in fanaticism and in their freedom from priestly bondage the presbyterians follow after at an equal distance in both these particulars in short this observation be found on the most certain experience and will also appear to be found on reason if we consider that as enthusiasm arise from a presumptuous pride and confidence it think itself sufficiently qualify to approach the divinity without any human mediator its rapturous devotions be so fervent that it even imagine itself actually to approach him by the way of contemplation and inward converse which make it neglect all those outward ceremonies and observances to which the assistance of the priests appear so requisite in the eye of their superstitious votaries the fanatick consecrate himself and bestow on his own person a sacred character much superior to what form and ceremonious institutions can confer on any other tis therefore an infallible rule that superstition be favourable to priestly power and euthusiasm as much or rather more contrary to it than sound reason and philosophy the consequences be evident when the first fire of enthusiasm be spend men naturally in such fanatical sects sink into the greatest remissness and coolness in sacred matter there be no body of men amongst them endowd with sufficient authority whose interest be concern to support the religious spirit superstition on the contrary steal in gradually and insensibly render men tame and submissive be acceptable to the magistrate and seem inoffensive to the people till at last the priest have firmly establishd his authority become the tyrant and disturber of human society by his endless contentions persecutions and religious war how smoothly do the romish church advance in their acquisition of power but into what dismal convulsions do they throw all europe in order to maintain it on the other hand our sectaries who be formerly such dangerous bigots be now become our greatest freethinkers and the quakers be perhaps the only regular body of deists in the universe except the literati or disciples of confucius in china gc to p proceed have confest that there be something accidental in the origin and progress of the arts in any nation and yet can not forbear think that if the other learn and polite nations of europe have possest the same advantage of a popular government they would probably have carry eloquence to a greater height than it have yet reach in britain the french sermons especially those of flechier and bossuet be much superior to the english in this particular and in both these author be find many stroke of the most sublime poetry and and in flechier there be find many stroke of the most sublime poetry his funeral sermon on the marechal de turenne be a good instance none but private cause in that country be ever debate before their parliaments or court of judicature but notwithstanding this disadvantage there appear a spirit of eloquence in many of their lawyers which with proper cultivation and encouragement might rise to the greatest height the plead of patru be very elegant and give us room to imagine what so fine a genius could have perform in question concern public liberty or slavery peace or war who exert himself with such success in debate concern the price of an old horse or a gossip story of a quarrel between an abbess and her nuns for tis remarkable that this polite writer tho esteem by all the men of wit in his time be never employ in the most considerable cause of their court of judicature but live and die in poverty from an ancient prejudice industriously propagate by the dunces in all countries that a man of genius be unfit for business the disorder produce by the factions against cardinal mazarine make the parliament of paris enter into the discussion of public affairs and during that short interval there appear many symptoms of the revival of ancient eloquence the avocat generaltalon in an oration invoke on his knees the spirit of st louis to look down with compassion on his divide and unhappy people and to inspire them from above with the love of concord and unanimity the members of the french academy have attempt to give us model of eloquence in their harangue at their admittance but have no subject to discourse upon they have run altogether into a fulsome strain of panegyric and flattery the most barren of all subject their stile however be commonly on these occasion very elevate and sublime and might reach the greatest heights be it employ on a subject more favourable and engage there be some circumstances confess in the english temper and genius which be disadvantageous to the progress of eloquence and render all attempt of that kind more dangerous and difficult among them than among any other nation the english be conspicuous for goodsense which make them very jealous of any attempt to deceive them by the flower of rhetoric and elocution they be also peculiarly modest which make them consider it as a piece of arrogance to offer any thing but reason to public assemblies or attempt to guide them by passion or fancy may perhaps be allow to add that the people in general be not remarkable for delicacy of taste or for sensibility to the charm of the muse their musical part to use the expression of a noble author be but indifferent hence their comic poets to move them must have recourse to obscenity their tragic poets to blood and slaughter and hence their orators be deprive of any such resource have abandon altogether the hop of move them and have confine themselves to plain argument and reason these circumstances join to particular accidents may perhaps have retard the growth of eloquence in this kingdom but will not be able to prevent its success if ever it appear amongst us and one may safely pronounce that this be a field in which the most flourish laurels may yet be gather if any youth of accomplish genius thoroughly acquaint with all the polite arts and not ignorant of public business should appear in parliament and accustom our ears to an eloquence more command and pathetic and to confirm me in this opinion there occur two considerations the one derive from ancient the other from modern time jeditions to p insert tis but an indifferent compliment which horace pay to his friend grosphus in the ode address to him no one say he be happy in every respect and may perhaps enjoy some advantage which you be deprive of you possess great riches your bellow herd cover thesicilianplains your chariot be draw by the finest horse and you be array in the richest purple but the indulgent fat with a small inheritance have givenmea fine genius and have endow me with a contempt for the malignant judgments of the vulgarphædrus say to his patron eutychus if you intend to read my work shall be please if not shall at least have the advantage of please posterity be apt to think that a modern poet would not have be guilty of such an impropriety as that which may be observe in virgils address to augustus when after a great deal of extravagant flattery and after have deify the emperor accord to the custom of those time he at last place this god on the same level with himself by your gracious nod say he render my undertake prosperous and take pity together with me of the swains ignorant of husbandry bestow your favourable influence on this work have men in that age be accustom to observe such niceties a writer so delicate as virgil would certainly have give a different turn to this sentence the court of augustus however polite have not yet it seem wear off the manners of the republic feditions to p add as follow if a spanish lady must not be suppose to have legs what must be suppose of a turkish lady she must not be suppose to have a be at all accordingly tis esteem a piece of rudeness and indecency at constantinople ever to make mention of a man wive before him in europe tis true fine breed people make it also a rule never to talk of their wive but the reason be not found on our jealousy suppose it be because we should be apt be it not for this rule to become troublesome to company by talk too much of them the author of the persian letter have give a different reason for this polite maxim men say he never care to mention their wive in company lest they should talk of them before people who be better acquaint with them than themselves beditions h to p proceed as follow europe have now for above a century remain on the defensive against the greatest force that ever perhaps be form by the civil or political combination of mankind and such be the influence of the maxim here treat of that tho that ambitious nation in the five last general war have be victorious in four and unsuccessful only in one they have not much enlarge their dominions nor acquire a total ascendant over europe there remain rather room to hope that by maintain the resistance for some time the natural revolutions of human affairs together with unforeseen events and accidents may guard us against universal monarchy and preserve the world from so great an evil in the three last of these general war britain have stand foremost in the glorious struggle and she still maintain her station as guardian of the general liberties of europe and patron of mankind beditions h to p insert as follow tis always observe in years of scarcity if it be not extreme that the poor labour more and really live better than in years of great plenty when they indulge themselves in idleness and riot have be tell by a considerable manufacturer that in the year when bread and provision of all kinds be very dear his workmen not only make a shift to live but pay debts which they have contract in former years that be much more favourable and abundant this doctrine therefore with regard to tax may be admit in some degree but beware of the abuse exorbitant tax like extreme necessity destroy industry by produce despair and even before they reach this pitch they raise the wag of the labourer and manufacturer and heighten the price of all commodities an attentive disinterested legislature will observe the point when the emolument cease and the prejudice begin but as the contrary character be much more common tis to be fear that tax all over europe be multiply to such a degree as will intirely crush all art and industry tho perhaps their first increase together with other circumstances might have contribute to the growth of these advantage deditions h to p add there be a word which be here in the mouth of every body and which find have also get abroad and be much employ by foreign writers in imitation of the english and this be circulation this word serve as an account of every thing and though confess that have seek for its mean in the present subject ever since be a schoolboy have never yet be able to discover it what possible advantage be there which the nation can reap by the easy transference of stock from hand to hand or be there any parallel to be draw from the circulation of other commodities to that of chequernotes and india bond where a manufacturer have a quick sale of his goods to the merchant the merchant to the shopkeeper the shopkeeper to his customers this enliven industry and give new encouragement to the first dealer or the manufacturer and all his tradesmen and make them produce more and better commodities of the same species a stagnation be here pernicious wherever it happen because it operate backwards and stop or benumb the industrious hand in its production of what be useful to human life but what production we owe to changealley or even what consumption except that of coffee and pen ink and paper have not yet learn nor can one forsee the loss or decay of any one beneficial commerce or commodity though that place and all its inhabitants be for ever bury in the ocean but though this term have never be explain by those who insist so much on the advantage that result from a circulation there seem however to be some benefit of a similiar kind arise from our incumbrances as indeed what human evil be there which be not attend with some advantage this we shall endeavour to explain that we may estimate the weight which we ought to allow it leditions h to p add could folards project of the column take place which seem impracticable it would render modern battle as destructive as the antient weditions h to proceed as follow the critical art may very justly be suspect of temerity when it pretend to correct or dispute the plain testimony of ancient historians by any probable or analogical reason yet the licence of author upon all subject particularly with regard to number be so great that we ought still to retain a kind of doubt or reserve whenever the facts advance depart in the least from the common bound of nature and experience shall give an instance with regard to modern history sir william temple tell us in his memoirs that have a free conversation with charles the he take the opportunity of represent to that monarch the impossibility of introduce into this island the religion and government of france chiefly on account of the great force requisite to subdue the spirit and liberty of so brave a people the romans say he be force to keep up twelve legions for that purpose a great absurdity and cromwell leave an army of near eighty thousand men must not this last be regard as unquestioned by future critics when they find it assert by a wise and learn minister of state cotemporary to the fact and who address his discourse upon an ungrateful subject to a great monarch who be also cotemporary and who himself break those very force about fourteen years before yet by the most undoubted authority we may insist that cromwells army when he die do not amount to half the number here mention bfor this sentence and the next editions h to p read as follow k to p in a note it appear from the speeches and proclamations and whole train of king jam be action as well as his sons that they consider the english government as a simple monarchy and never imagine that any considerable part of their subject entertain a contrary idea this make them discover their pretensions without prepare any force to support them and even without reserve or disguise which be always employ by those who enter upon any new project or endeavour to innovate in any government king jam tell his parliament plainly when they meddle in state affairs ne sutor ultra crepidam he use also at his table in promiscuous company to advance his notions in a manner still more undisguised as we may learn from a story tell in the life of mr waller and which that poet use frequently to repeat when mr waller be young he have the curiosity to go to court and he stand in the circle and saw king jam dine where amongst other company there sit at table two bishops the king openly and aloud propose this question whether he might not take his subject money when he have occasion for it without all this formality of parliament the one bishop readily reply god forbid you should not for you be the breath of our nostrils the other bishop decline answer and say he be not skilled in parliamentary case but upon the kings urge him and say he would admit of no evasion his lordship reply very pleasantly why then think your majesty may lawfully take my brothers money for he offer it in sir walter raleighs preface to the history of the world there be this remarkable passage philip by strong hand and main force attempt to make himself not only an absolute monarch over the netherlands like unto the kings and sovereigns of england and france but turklike to tread under his feet all their natural and fundamental laws privilege and antient rightsspenser speak of some grant of the english kings to the irish corporations say all which tho at the time of their first grant they be tolerable and perhaps reasonable yet now be most unreasonable and inconvenient but all these will easily be cut off with the superior power of her majestys prerogative against which her own grant be not to be plead or inforced state ofireland p edit as these be very common if not perhaps the universal notions of the time the two first princes of the house of stuart be the more excusable for their mistake and rapin suitable to his usual malignity and partiality seem to treat them with too much severity upon account of it geditions h to p insert the follow paragraph in the last war it have be of service to us by furnish us with a considerable body of auxiliary troop the bravest and most faithful in the world the elector of hanover be the only considerable prince in the empire who have pursue no separate end and have raise up no stale pretensions during the late commotions of europe but have act all along with the dignity of a king of britain and ever since the accession of that family it would be difficult to show any harm we have ever receive from the electoral dominions except that short disgust in with charles who regulate himself by maxims very different from those of other princes make a personal quarrel of every public injury miscellaneous reflections some of the opinions deliver in these essay with regard to the public transactions in the last century the author on more accurate examination find reason to retract in his history of great britain and as he would not enslave himself to the systems of either party neither would he fetter his judgment by his own preconceive opinions and principles nor be he ashamed to acknowledge his mistake this note do not occur in any edition prior to by priests understand only the pretenders to power and dominion and to a superior sanctity of character distinct from virtue and good morals these be very different from clergymen who be set apart by the laws

chiefly as bear for action and as influence in his measure by taste and sentiment pursue one object and avoid another accord to the value which these object seem to possess and accord to the light in which they present themselves as virtue of all object be allow to be the most valuable this species of philosophers paint her in the most amiable colour borrow all help from poetry and eloquence and treat their subject in an easy and obvious manner and such as be best fit to please the imagination and engage the affections they select the most strike observations and instance from common life place opposite character in a proper contrast and allure us into the paths of virtue by the view of glory and happiness direct our step in these paths by the soundest precepts and most illustrious examples they make us feel the difference between vice and virtue they excite and regulate our sentiments and so they can but bend our hearts to the love of probity and true honour they think that they have fully attain the end of all their labour the other species of philosophers consider man in the light of a reasonable rather than an active be and endeavour to form his understand more than cultivate his manners they regard human nature as a subject of speculation and with a narrow scrutiny examine it in order to find those principles which regulate our understand excite our sentiments and make us approve or blame any particular object action or behaviour they think it a reproach to all literature that philosophy should not yet have fix beyond controversy the foundation of morals reason and criticism and should for ever talk of truth and falsehood vice and virtue beauty and deformity without be able to determine the source of these distinctions while they attempt this arduous task they be deter by no difficulties but proceed from particular instance to general principles they still push on their enquiries to principles more general and rest not satisfy till they arrive at those original principles by which in every science all human curiosity must be bound though their speculations seem abstract and even unintelligible to common readers they aim at the approbation of the learn and the wise and think themselves sufficiently compensate for the labour of their whole live if they can discover some hide truths which may contribute to the instruction of posterity it be certain that the easy and obvious philosophy will always with the generality of mankind have the preference above the accurate and abstruse and by many will be recommend not only as more agreeable but more useful than the other it enter more into common life mould the heart and affections and by touch those principles which actuate men reform their conduct and bring them nearer to that model of perfection which it describe on the contrary the abstruse philosophy be found on a turn of mind which can not enter into business and action vanish when the philosopher leave the shade and come into open day nor can its principles easily retain any influence over our conduct and behaviour the feel of our heart the agitation of our passions the vehemence of our affections dissipate all its conclusions and reduce the profound philosopher to a mere plebeian this also must be confess that the most durable as well as justest fame have be acquire by the easy philosophy and that abstract reasoners seem hitherto to have enjoy only a momentary reputation from the caprice or ignorance of their own age but have not be able to support their renown with more equitable posterity it be easy for a profound philosopher to commit a mistake in his subtile reason and one mistake be the necessary parent of another while he push on his consequences and be not deter from embrace any conclusion by its unusual appearance or its contradiction to popular opinion but a philosopher who purpose only to represent the common sense of mankind in more beautiful and more engage colour if by accident he fall into error go no farther but renew his appeal to common sense and the natural sentiments of the mind return into the right path and secure himself from any dangerous illusions the fame of cicero flourish at present but that of aristotle be utterly decay la bruyere pass the seas and still maintain his reputation but the glory of malebranche be confine to his own nation and to his own age and addison perhaps will be read with pleasure when locke shall be entirely forget the mere philosopher be a character which be commonly but little acceptable in the world as be suppose to contribute nothing either to the advantage or pleasure of society while he live remote from communication with mankind and be wrap up in principles and notions equally remote from their comprehension on the other hand the mere ignorant be still more despise nor be anything deem a surer sign of an illiberal genius in an age and nation where the sciences flourish than to be entirely destitute of all relish for those noble entertainments the most perfect character be suppose to lie between those extremes retain an equal ability and taste for book company and business preserve in conversation that discernment and delicacy which arise from polite letter and in business that probity and accuracy which be the natural result of a just philosophy in order to diffuse and cultivate so accomplish a character nothing can be more useful than compositions of the easy style and manner which draw not too much from life require no deep application or retreat to be comprehend and send back the student among mankind full of noble sentiments and wise precepts applicable to every exigence of human life by mean of such compositions virtue become amiable science agreeable company instructive and retirement entertain man be a reasonable be and as such receive from science his proper food and nourishment but so narrow be the bound of human understand that little satisfaction can be hop for in this particular either from the extent of security or his acquisitions man be a sociable no less than a reasonable be but neither can he always enjoy company agreeable and amuse or preserve the proper relish for them man be also an active be and from that disposition as well as from the various necessities of human life must submit to business and occupation but the mind require some relaxation and can not always support its bend to care and industry it seem then that nature have point out a mix kind of life as most suitable to the human race and secretly admonish them to allow none of these bias to draw too much so as to incapacitate them for other occupations and entertainments indulge your passion for science say she but let your science be human and such as may have a direct reference to action and society abstruse think and profound research prohibit and will severely punish by the pensive melancholy which they introduce by the endless uncertainty in which they involve you and by the cold reception which your pretend discoveries shall meet with when communicate be a philosopher but amidst all your philosophy be still a man be the generality of mankind content to prefer the easy philosophy to the abstract and profound without throw any blame or contempt on the latter it might not be improper perhaps to comply with this general opinion and allow every man to enjoy without opposition his own taste and sentiment but as the matter be often carry farther even to the absolute reject of all profound reason or what be commonly call metaphysics we shall now proceed to consider what can reasonably be plead in their behalf we may begin with observe that one considerable advantage which result from the accurate and abstract philosophy be its subserviency to the easy and humane which without the former can never attain a sufficient degree of exactness in its sentiments precepts or reason all polite letter be nothing but picture of human life in various attitudes and situations and inspire us with different sentiments of praise or blame admiration or ridicule accord to the qualities of the object which they set before us an artist must be better qualify to succeed in this undertake who besides a delicate taste and a quick apprehension possess an accurate knowledge of the internal fabric the operations of the understand the work of the passions and the various species of sentiment which discriminate vice and virtue how painful soever this inward search or enquiry may appear it become in some measure requisite to those who would describe with success the obvious and outward appearances of life and manners the anatomist present to the eye the most hideous and disagreeable object but his science be useful to the painter in delineate even a venus or an helen while the latter employ all the richest colour of his art and give his figure the most graceful and engage air he must still carry his attention to the inward structure of the human body the position of the muscle the fabric of the bone and the use and figure of every part or organ accuracy be in every case advantageous to beauty and just reason to delicate sentiment in vain would we exalt the one by depreciate the other besides we may observe in every art or profession even those which most concern life or action that a spirit of accuracy however acquire carry all of them nearer their perfection and render them more subservient to the interest of society and though a philosopher may live remote from business the genius of philosophy if carefully cultivate by several must gradually diffuse itself throughout the whole society and bestow a similar correctness on every art and call the politician will acquire greater foresight and subtility in the subdivide and balance of power the lawyer more method and finer principles in his reason and the general more regularity in his discipline and more caution in his plan and operations the stability of modern governments above the ancient and the accuracy of modern philosophy have improve and probably will still improve by similar gradations be there no advantage to be reap from these study beyond the gratification of an innocent curiosity yet ought not even this to be despise as be one accession to those few safe and harmless pleasures which be bestow on the human race the sweetest and most inoffensive path of life lead through the avenues of science and learn and whoever can either remove any obstructions in this way or open up any new prospect ought so far to be esteem a benefactor to mankind and though these research may appear painful and fatigue it be with some mind as with some body which be endow with vigorous and florid health require severe exercise and reap a pleasure from what to the generality of mankind may seem burdensome and laborious obscurity indeed be painful to the mind as well as to the eye but to bring light from obscurity by whatever labour must need be delightful and rejoice but this obscurity in the profound and abstract philosophy be object to not only as painful and fatigue but as the inevitable source of uncertainty and error here indeed lie the justest and most plausible objection against a considerable part of metaphysics that they be not properly a science but arise either from the fruitless efforts of human vanity which would penetrate into subject utterly inaccessible to the understand or from the craft of popular superstitions which be unable to defend themselves on fair grind raise these intangling brambles to cover and protect their weakness chase from the open country these robbers fly into the forest and lie in wait to break in upon every unguarded avenue of the mind and overwhelm it with religious fear and prejudice the stoutest antagonist if he remit his watch a moment be oppress and many through cowardice and folly open the gate to the enemies and willingly receive them with reverence and submission as their legal sovereigns but be this a sufficient reason why philosophers should desist from such research and leave superstition still in possession of her retreat be it not proper to draw an opposite conclusion and perceive the necessity of carry the war into the most secret recess of the enemy in vain do we hope that men from frequent disappointment will at last abandon such airy sciences and discover the proper province of human reason for besides that many persons find too sensible an interest in perpetually recall such topics besides this say the motive of blind despair can never reasonably have place in the sciences since however unsuccessful former attempt may have prove there be still room to hope that the industry good fortune or improve sagacity of succeed generations may reach discoveries unknown to former age each adventurous genius will still leap at the arduous prize and find himself stimulate rather that discourage by the failures of his predecessors while he hop that the glory of achieve so hard an adventure be reserve for him alone the only method of free learn at once from these abstruse question be to enquire seriously into the nature of human understand and show from an exact analysis of its power and capacity that it be by no mean fit for such remote and abstruse subject we must submit to this fatigue in order to live at ease ever after and must cultivate true metaphysics with some care in order to destroy the false and adulterate indolence which to some persons afford a safeguard against this deceitful philosophy be with others overbalance by curiosity and despair which at some moments prevail may give place afterwards to sanguine hop and expectations accurate and just reason be the only catholic remedy fit for all persons and all dispositions and be alone able to subvert that abstruse philosophy and metaphysical jargon which be mix up with popular superstition render it in a manner impenetrable to careless reasoners and give it the air of science and wisdom besides this advantage of reject after deliberate enquiry the most uncertain and disagreeable part of learn there be many positive advantage which result from an accurate scrutiny into the power and faculties of human nature it be remarkable concern the operations of the mind that though most intimately present to us yet whenever they become the object of reflexion they seem involve in obscurity nor can the eye readily find those line and boundaries which dis criminate and distinguish them the object be too fine to remain long in the same aspect or situation and must be apprehend in an instant by a superior penetration derive from nature and improve by habit and reflexion it become therefore no inconsiderable part of science barely to know the different operations of the mind to separate them from each other to class them under their proper head and to correct all that seem disorder in which they lie involve when make the object of reflexion and enquiry this talk of order and distinguish which have no merit when perform with regard to external body the object of our sense rise in its value when direct towards the operations of the mind in proportion to the difficulty and labour which we meet with in perform it and if we can go no farther than this mental geography or delineation of the distinct part and power of the mind it be at least a satisfaction to go so far and the more obvious this science may appear and it be by no mean obvious the more contemptible still must the ignorance of it be esteem in all pretenders to learn and philosophy nor can there remain any suspicion that this science be uncertain and chimerical unless we should entertain such a scepticism as be entirely subversive of all speculation and even action it can not be doubt that the mind be endow with several power and faculties that these power be distinct from each other that what be really distinct to the immediate perception may be distinguish by reflexion and consequently that there be a truth and falsehood in all proposition on this subject and a truth and falsehood which lie not beyond the compass of human understand there be many obvious distinctions of this kind such as those between the will and understand the imagination and passions which fall within the comprehension of every human creature and the finer and more philosophical distinctions be no less real and certain though more difficult to be comprehend some instance especially late ones of success in these enquiries may give us a juster notion of the certainty and solidity of this branch of learn and shall we esteem it worthy the labour of a philosopher to give us a true system of the planets and adjust the position and order of those remote body while we affect to overlook those who with so much success delineate the part of the mind in which we be so intimately concern but may we not hope that philosophy if cultivate with care and encourage by the attention of the public may carry its research still farther and discover at least in some degree the secret spring and principles by which the human mind be actuate in its operations astronomers have long content themselves with prove from the phaenomena the true motion order and magnitude of the heavenly body till a philosopher at last arise who seem from the happiest reason to have also determine the laws and force by which the revolutions of the planets be govern and direct the like have be perform with regard to other part of nature and there be no reason to despair of equal success in our enquiries concern the mental power and economy if prosecute with equal capacity and caution it be probable that one operation and principle of the mind depend on another which again may be resolve into one more general and universal and how far these research may possibly be carry it will be difficult for us before or even after a careful trial exactly to determine this be certain that attempt of this kind be every day make even by those who philosophize the most negligently and nothing can be more requisite than to enter upon the enterprize with thorough care and attention that if it lie within the compass of human understand it may at last be happily achieve if not it may however be reject with some confidence and security this last conclusion surely be not desirable nor ought it to be embrace too rashly for how much must we diminish from the beauty and value of this species of philosophy upon such a supposition moralists have hitherto be accustom when they consider the vast multitude and diversity of those action that excite our approbation or dislike to search for some common principle on which this variety of sentiments might depend and though they have sometimes carry the matter too far by their passion for some one general principle it must however be confess that they be excusable in expect to find some general principles into which all the vices and virtues be justly to be resolve the like have be the endeavour of critics logicians and even politicians nor have their attempt be wholly unsuccessful though perhaps longer time greater accuracy and more ardent application may bring these sciences still nearer their perfection to throw up at once all pretensions of this kind may justly be deem more rash precipitate and dogmatical than even the boldest and most affirmative philosophy that have ever attempt to impose its crude dictate and principles on mankind what though these reason concern human nature seem abstract and of difficult comprehension this afford no presumption of their falsehood on the contrary it seem impossible that what have hitherto escape so many wise and profound philosophers can be very obvious and easy and whatever pain these research may cost us we may think ourselves sufficiently reward not only in point of profit but of pleasure if by that mean we can make any addition to our stock of knowledge in subject of such unspeakable importance but as after all the abstractedness of these speculations be no recommendation but rather a disadvantage to them and as this difficulty may perhaps be surmount by care and art and the avoid of all unnecessary detail we have in the follow enquiry attempt to throw some light upon subject from which uncertainty have hitherto deter the wise and obscurity the ignorant happy if we can unite the boundaries of the different species of philosophy by reconcile profound enquiry with clearness and truth with novelty and still more happy if reason in this easy manner we can undermine the foundations of an abstruse philosophy which seem to have hitherto serve only as a shelter to superstition and a cover to absurdity and error sect of the origin of ideas every one will readily allow that there be a considerable difference between the perceptions of the mind when a man feel the pain of excessive heat or the pleasure of moderate warmth and when he afterwards recall to his memory this sensation or anticipate it by his imagination these faculties may mimic or copy the perceptions of the sense but they never can entirely reach the force and vivacity of the original sentiment the utmost we say of them even when they operate with greatest vigour be that they represent their object in so lively a manner that we could almost say we feel or see it but except the mind be disorder by disease or madness they never can arrive at such a pitch of vivacity as to render these perceptions altogether undistinguishable all the colour of poetry however splendid can never paint natural object in such a manner as to make the description be take for a real landskip the most lively think be still inferior to the dullest sensation we may observe a like distinction to run through all the other perceptions of the mind a man in a fit of anger be actuate in a very different manner from one who only think of that emotion if you tell me that any person be in love easily understand your mean and form a just conception of his situation but never can mistake that conception for the real disorder and agitations of the passion when we reflect on our past sentiments and affections our think be a faithful mirror and copy its object truly but the colour which it employ be faint and dull in comparison of those in which our original perceptions be clothe it require no nice discernment or metaphysical head to mark the distinction between them here therefore we may divide all the perceptions of the mind into two class or species which be distinguish by their different degrees of force and vivacity the less forcible and lively be commonly denominate thoughts or ideas the other species want a name in our language and in most others suppose because it be not requisite for any but philosophical purpose to rank them under a general term or appellation let us therefore use a little freedom and call them impressions employ that word in a sense somewhat different from the usual by the term impression then mean all our more lively perceptions when we hear or see or feel or love or hate or desire or will and impressions be distinguish from ideas which be the less lively perceptions of which we be conscious when we reflect on any of those sensations or movements above mention nothing at first view may seem more unbounded than the think of man which not only escape all human power and authority but be not even restrain within the limit of nature and reality to form monsters and join incongruous shape and appearances cost the imagination no more trouble than to conceive the most natural and familiar object and while the body be confine to one planet along which it creep with pain and difficulty the think can in an instant transport us into the most distant regions of the universe or even beyond the universe into the unbounded chaos where nature be suppose to lie in total confusion what never be see or hear of may yet be conceive nor be any thing beyond the power of think except what imply an absolute contradiction but though our think seem to possess this unbounded liberty we shall find upon a nearer examination that it be really confine within very narrow limit and that all this creative power of the mind amount to no more than the faculty of compound transpose augment or diminish the materials afford us by the sense and experience when we think of a golden mountain we only join two consistent ideas gold and mountain with which we be formerly acquaint a virtuous horse we can conceive because from our own feel we can conceive virtue and this we may unite to the figure and shape of a horse which be an animal familiar to us in short all the materials of think be derive either from our outward or inward sentiment the mixture and composition of these belong alone to the mind and will or to express myself in philosophical language all our ideas or more feeble perceptions be copy of our impressions or more lively ones to prove this the two follow arguments will hope be sufficient first when we analyze our thoughts or ideas however compound or sublime we always find that they resolve themselves into such simple ideas as be copy from a precedent feel or sentiment even those ideas which at first view seem the most wide of this origin be find upon a nearer scrutiny to be derive from it the idea of god as mean an infinitely intelligent wise and good be arise from reflect on the operations of our own mind and augment without limit those qualities of goodness and wisdom we may prosecute this enquiry to what length we please where we shall always find that every idea which we examine be copy from a similar impression those who would assert that this position be not universally true nor without exception have only one and that an easy method of refute it by produce that idea which in their opinion be not derive from this source it will then be incumbent on us if we would maintain our doctrine to produce the impression or lively perception which correspond to it secondly if it happen from a defect of the organ that a man be not susceptible of any species of sensation we always find that he be as little susceptible of the correspondent ideas a blind man can form no notion of colour a deaf man of sound restore either of them that sense in which he be deficient by open this new inlet for his sensations you also open an inlet for the ideas and he find no difficulty in conceive these object the case be the same if the object proper for excite any sensation have never be apply to the organ a laplander or negro have no notion of the relish of wine and though there be few or no instance of a like deficiency in the mind where a person have never felt or be wholly incapable of a sentiment or passion that belong to his species yet we find the same observation to take place in a less degree a man of mild manners can form no idea of inveterate revenge or cruelty nor can a selfish heart easily conceive the heights of friendship and generosity it be readily allow that other be may possess many sense of which we can have no conception because the ideas of them have never be introduce to us in the only manner by which an idea can have access to the mind to wit by the actual feel and sensa tion there be however one contradictory phenomenon which may prove that it be not absolutely impossible for ideas to arise independent of their correspondent impressions believe it will readily be allow that the several distinct ideas of colour which enter by the eye or those of sound which be convey by the ear be really different from each other though at the same time resemble now if this be true of different colour it must be no less so of the different shade of the same colour and each shade produce a distinct idea independent of the rest for if this should be deny it be possible by the continual gradation of shade to run a colour insensibly into what be most remote from it and if you will not allow any of the mean to be different you can not without absurdity deny the extremes to be the same suppose therefore a person to have enjoy his sight for thirty years and to have become perfectly acquaint with colour of all kinds except one particular shade of blue for instance which it never have be his fortune to meet with let all the different shade of that colour except that single one be place before him descend gradually from the deepest to the lightest it be plain that he will perceive a blank where that shade be want and will be sensible that there be a greater distance in that place between the contiguous colour than in any other now ask whether it be possible for him from his own imagination to supply this deficiency and raise up to himself the idea of that particular shade though it have never be convey to him by his sense believe there be few but will be of opinion that he can and this may serve as a proof that the simple ideas be not always in every instance derive from the correspondent impressions though this instance be so singular that it be scarcely worth our observe and do not merit that for it alone we should alter our general maxim here therefore be a proposition which not only seem in itself simple and intelligible but if a proper use be make of it might render every dispute equally intelligible and banish all that jargon which have so long take possession of metaphysical reason and draw disgrace upon them all ideas especially abstract ones be naturally faint and obscure the mind have but a slender hold of them they be apt to be confound with other resemble ideas and when we have often employ any term though without a distinct mean we be apt to imagine it have a determinate idea annex to it on the contrary all impressions that be all sensations either outward or inward be strong and vivid the limit between them be more exactly determine nor be it easy to fall into any error or mistake with regard to them when we entertain therefore any suspicion that a philosophical term be employ without any mean or idea as be but too frequent we need but enquire from what impression be that suppose idea derive and if it be impossible to assign any this will serve to confirm our suspicion by bring ideas into so clear a light we may reasonably hope to remove all dispute which may arise concern their nature and reality but admit these term impressions and ideas in the sense above explain and understand by innate what be original or copy from no precedent perception then may we assert that all our impressions be innate and our ideas not innate to be ingenuous must own it to be my opinion that locke be betray into this question by the schoolmen who make use of undefined term draw out their dispute to a tedious length without ever touch the point in question a like ambiguity and circumlocution seem to run through that philosophers reason on this as well as most other subject sect of the association of ideas it be evident that there be a principle of connexion between the different thoughts or ideas of the mind and that in their appearance to the memory or imagination they introduce each other with a certain degree of method and regularity in our more serious think or discourse this be so observable that any particular think which break in upon the regular tract or chain of ideas be immediately remark and reject and even in our wildest and most wander reveries nay in our very dream we shall find if we reflect that the imagination run not altogether at adventure but that there be still a connexion uphold among the different ideas which succeed each other be the loosest and freest conversation to be transcribe there would immediately be observe something which connect it in all its transition or where this be want the person who break the thread of discourse might still inform you that there have secretly revolve in his mind a succession of think which have gradually lead him from the subject of conversation among different languages even where we can not suspect the least connexion or communication it be find that the word expressive of ideas the most compound do yet nearly correspond to each other a certain proof that the simple ideas comprehend in the compound ones be bind together by some universal principle which have an equal influence on all mankind though it be too obvious to escape observation that different ideas be connect together do not find that any philosopher have attempt to enumerate or class all the principles of association a subject however that seem worthy of curiosity to me there appear to be only three principles of connexion among ideas namely resemblance contiguity in time or place and cause or effect that these principles serve to connect ideas will not believe be much doubt a picture naturally lead our thoughts to the original the mention of one apartment in a build naturally introduce an enquiry or discourse concern the others and if we think of a wind we can scarcely forbear reflect on the pain which follow it but that this enumeration be complete and that there be no other principles of association except these may be difficult to prove to the satisfaction of the reader or even to a man own satisfaction all we can do in such case be to run over several instance and examine carefully the principle which bind the different thoughts to each other never stop till we render the principle as general as possible the more instance we examine and the more care we employ the more assurance shall we acquire that the enumeration which we form from the whole be complete and entire sect sceptical doubt concern the operations of the understand part all the object of human reason or enquiry may naturally be divide into two kinds to wit relations of ideas and matter of fact of the first kind be the sciences of geometry algebra and arithmetic and in short every affirmation which be either intuitively or demonstratively certain that the square of the hypothenuse be equal to the square of the two side be a proposition which express a relation between these figure that three time five be equal to the half of thirty express a relation between these number proposition of this kind be discoverable by the mere operation of think without dependence on what be anywhere existent in the universe though there never be a circle or triangle in nature the truths demonstrate by euclid would for ever retain their certainty and evidence matter of fact which be the second object of human reason be not ascertain in the same manner nor be our evidence of their truth however great of a like nature with the forego the contrary of every matter of fact be still possible because it can never imply a contradiction and be conceive by the mind with the same facility and distinctness as if ever so conformable to reality that the sun will not rise tomorrow be no less intelligible a proposition and imply no more contradiction than the affirmation that it will rise we should in vain therefore attempt to demonstrate its falsehood be it demonstratively false it would imply a contradiction and could never be distinctly conceive by the mind it may therefore be a subject worthy of curiosity to enquire what be the nature of that evidence which assure us of any real existence and matter of fact beyond the present testimony of our sense or the record of our memory this part of philosophy it be observable have be little cultivate either by the ancients or moderns and therefore our doubt and errors in the prosecution of so important an enquiry may be the more excusable while we march through such difficult paths without any guide or direction they may even prove useful by excite curiosity and destroy that implicit faith and security which be the bane of all reason and free enquiry the discovery of defect in the common philosophy if any such there be will not presume be a discouragement but rather an incitement as be usual to attempt something more full and satisfactory than have yet be propose to the public all reason concern matter of fact seem to be found on the realtion of cause and effect by mean of that relation alone we can go beyond the evidence of our memory and sense if you be to ask a man why he believe any matter of fact which be absent for instance that his friend be in the country or in france he would give you a reason and this reason would be some other fact as a letter receive from him or the knowledge of his former resolutions and promise a man find a watch or any other machine in a desert island would conclude that there have once be men in that island all our reason concern fact be of the same nature and here it be constantly suppose that there be a connexion between the present fact and that which be infer from it be there nothing to bind them together the inference would be entirely precarious the hear of an articulate voice and rational discourse in the dark assure us of the presence of some person why because these be the effect of the human make and fabric and closely connect with it if we anatomize all the other reason of this nature we shall find that they be found on the relation of cause and effect and that this relation be either near or remote direct or collateral heat and light be collateral effect of fire and the one effect may justly be infer from the other if we would satisfy ourselves therefore concern the nature of that evidence which assure us of matter of fact we must enquire how we arrive at the knowledge of cause and effect shall venture to affirm as a general proposition which admit of no exception that the knowledge of this relation be not in any instance attain by reason a priori but arise entirely from experience when we find that any particular object be constantly conjoin with each other let an object be present to a man of ever so strong natural reason and abilities if that object be entirely new to him he will not be able by the most accurate examination of its sensible qualities to discover any of its cause or effect adam though his rational faculties be suppose at the very first entirely perfect could not have infer from the fluidity and transparency of water that it would suffocate him or from the light and warmth of fire that it would consume him no object ever discover by the qualities which appear to the sense either the cause which produce it or the effect which will arise from it nor can our reason unassisted by experience ever draw any inference concern real existence and matter of fact this proposition that cause and effect be discoverable not by reason but by experience will readily be admit with regard to such object as we remember to have once be altogether unknown to us since we must be conscious of the utter inability which we then lay under of foretell what would arise from them present two smooth piece of marble to a man who have no tincture of natural philosophy he will never discover that they will adhere together in such a manner as to require great force to separate them in a direct line while they make so small a resistance to a lateral pressure such events as bear little analogy to the common course of nature be also readily confess to be know only by experience nor do any man imagine that the explosion of gunpowder or the attraction of a loadstone could ever be discover by arguments a priori in like manner when an effect be suppose to depend upon an intricate machinery or secret structure of part we make no difficulty in attribute all our knowledge of it to experience who will assert that he can give the ultimate reason why milk or bread be proper nourishment for a man not for a lion or a tiger but the same truth may not appear at first sight to have the same evidence with regard to events which have become familiar to us from our first appearance in the world which bear a close analogy to the whole course of nature and which be suppose to depend on the simple qualities of object without any secret structure of part we be apt to imagine that we could discover these effect by the mere operation of our reason without experience we fancy that be we bring on a sudden into this world we could at first have infer that one billiardball would communicate motion to another upon impulse and that we need not to have wait for the event in order to pronounce with certainty concern it such be the influence of custom that where it be strongest it not only cover our natural ignorance but even conceal itself and seem not to take place merely because it be find in the highest degree but to convince us that all the laws of nature and all the operations of body without exception be know only by experience the follow reflections may perhaps suffice be any object present to us and be we require to pronounce concern the effect which will result from it without consult past observation after what manner beseech you must the mind proceed in this operation it must invent or imagine some event which it ascribe to the object as its effect and it be plain that this invention must be entirely arbitrary the mind can never possibly find the effect in the suppose cause by the most accurate scrutiny and examination for the effect be totally different from the cause and consequently can never be discover in it motion in the second billiardball be a quite distinct event from motion in the first nor be there anything in the one to suggest the smallest hint of the other a stone or piece of metal raise into the air and leave without any support immediately fall but to consider the matter a priori be there anything we discover in this situation which can beget the idea of a downward rather than an upward or any other motion in the stone or metal and as the first imagination or invention of a particular effect in all natural operations be arbitrary where we consult not experience so must we also esteem the suppose tie or connexion between the cause and effect which bind them together and render it impossible that any other effect could result from the operation of that cause when see for instance a billiardball move in a straight line towards another even suppose motion in the second ball should by accident be suggest to me as the result of their contact or impulse may not conceive that a hundred different events might as well follow from that cause may not both these ball remain at absolute rest may not the first ball return in a straight line or leap off from the second in any line or direction all these suppositions be consistent and conceivable why then should we give the preference to one which be no more consistent or conceivable than the rest all our reason a priori will never be able to show us any foundation for this preference in a word then every effect be a distinct event from its cause it could not therefore be discover in the cause and the first invention or conception of it a priori must be entirely arbitrary and even after it be suggest the conjunction of it with the cause must appear equally arbitrary since there be always many other effect which to reason must seem fully as consistent and natural in vain therefore should we pretend to determine any single event or infer any cause or effect without the assistance of observation and experience hence we may discover the reason why no philosopher who be rational and modest have ever pretend to assign the ultimate cause of any natural operation or to show distinctly the action of that power which produce any single effect in the universe it be confess that the utmost effort of human reason be to reduce the principles productive of natural phenomena to a greater simplicity and to resolve the many particular effect into a few general cause by mean of reason from analogy experience and observation but as to the cause of these general cause we should in vain attempt their discovery nor shall we ever be able to satisfy ourselves by any particular explication of them these ultimate spring and principles be totally shut up from human curiosity and enquiry elasticity gravity cohesion of part communication of motion by impulse these be probably the ultimate cause and principles which we shall ever discover in nature and we may esteem ourselves sufficiently happy if by accurate enquiry and reason we can trace up the particular phenomena to or near to these general principles the most perfect philosophy of the natural kind only stave off our ignorance a little longer as perhaps the most perfect philosophy of the moral or metaphysical kind serve only to discover larger portion of it thus the observation of human blindness and weakness be the result of all philosophy and meet us at every turn in spite of our endeavour to elude or avoid it nor be geometry when take into the assistance of natural philosophy ever able to remedy this defect or lead us into the knowledge of ultimate cause by all that accuracy of reason for which it be so justly celebrate every part of mix mathematics proceed upon the supposition that certain laws be establish by nature in her operations and abstract reason be employ either to assist experience in the discovery of these laws or to determine their influence in particular instance where it depend upon any precise degree of distance and quantity thus it be a law of motion discover by experience that the moment or force of any body in motion be in the compound ratio or proportion of its solid content and its velocity and consequently that a small force may remove the greatest obstacle or raise the greatest weight if by any contrivance or machinery we can increase the velocity of that force so as to make it an overmatch for its antagonist geometry assist us in the application of this law by give us the just dimension of all the part and figure which can enter into any species of machine but still the discovery of the law itself be owe merely to experience and all the abstract reason in the world could never lead us one step towards the knowledge of it when we reason a priori and consider merely any object or cause as it appear to the mind independent of all observation it never could suggest to us the notion of any distinct object such as its effect much less show us the inseparable and inviolable connexion between them a man must be very sagacious who could discover by reason that crystal be the effect of heat and ice of cold without be previously acquaint with the operation of these qualities part but we have not yet attain any tolerable satisfaction with regard to the question first propose each solution still give rise to a new question as difficult as the forego and lead us on to farther enquiries when it be ask what be the nature of all our reason concern matter of fact the proper answer seem to be that they be found on the relation of cause and effect when again it be ask what be the foundation of all our reason and conclusions concern that relation it may be reply in one word experience but if we still carry on our sift humour and ask what be the foundation of all conclusions from experience this imply a new question which may be of more difficult solution and explication philosophers that give themselves air of superior wisdom and sufficiency have a hard task when they encounter persons of inquisitive dispositions who push them from every corner to which they retreat and who be sure at last to bring them to some dangerous dilemma the best expedient to prevent this confusion be to be modest in our pretensions and even to discover the difficulty ourselves before it be object to us by this mean we may make a kind of merit of our very ignorance shall content myself in this section with an easy task and shall pretend only to give a negative answer to the question here propose say then that even after we have experience of the operations of cause and effect our conclusions from that experience be not found on reason or any process of the understand this answer we must endeavour both to explain and to defend it must certainly be allow that nature have keep us at a great distance from all her secrets and have afford us only the knowledge of a few superficial qualities of object while she conceal from us those power and principles on which the influence of those object entirely depend our sense inform us of the colour weight and consistence of bread but neither sense nor reason can ever inform us of those qualities which fit it for the nourishment and support of a human body sight or feel convey an idea of the actual motion of body but as to that wonderful force or power which would carry on a move body for ever in a continue change of place and which body never lose but by communicate it to others of this we can not form the most distant conception but notwithstanding this ignorance of natural power and principles we always presume when we see like sensible qualities that they have like secret power and expect that effect similar to those which we have experience will follow from them if a body of like colour and consistence with that bread which we have formerly eat be present to us we make no scruple of repeat the experiment and foresee with certainty like nourishment and support now this be a process of the mind or think of which would willingly know the foundation it be allow on all hand that there be no know connexion between the sensible qualities and the secret power and consequently that the mind be not lead to form such a conclusion concern their constant and regular conjunction by anything which it know of their nature as to past experience it can be allow to give direct and certain information of those precise object only and that precise period of time which fell under its cognizance but why this experience should be extend to future time and to other object which for aught we know may be only in appearance similar this be the main question on which would insist the bread which formerly eat nourish me that be a body of such sensible qualities be at that time endue with such secret power but do it follow that other bread must also nourish me at another time and that like sensible qualities must always be attend with like secret power the consequence seem nowise necessary at least it must be acknowledge that there be here a consequence draw by the mind that there be a certain step take a process of think and an inference which want to be explain these two proposition be far from be the same have find that such an object have always be attend with such an effect and foresee that other object which be in appearance similar will be attend with similar effect shall allow if you please that the one proposition may justly be infer from the other know in fact that it always be infer but if you insist that the inference be make by a chain of reason desire you to produce that reason the connexion between these proposition be not intuitive there be require a medium which may enable the mind to draw such an inference if indeed it be draw by reason and argument what that medium be must confess pass my comprehension and it be incumbent on those to produce it who assert that it really exist and be the origin of all our conclusions concern matter of fact this negative argument must certainly in process of time become altogether convince if many penetrate and able philosophers shall turn their enquiries this way and no one be ever able to discover any connect proposition or intermediate step which support the understand in this conclusion but as the question be yet new every reader may not trust so far to his own penetration as to conclude because an argument escape his enquiry that therefore it do not really exist for this reason it may be requisite to venture upon a more difficult task and enumerate all the branch of human knowledge endeavour to show that none of them can afford such an argument all reason may be divide into two kinds namely demonstrative reason or that concern relations of ideas and moral reason or that concern matter of fact and existence that there be no demonstrative arguments in the case seem evident since it imply no contradiction that the course of nature may change and that an object seemingly like those which we have experience may be attend with different or contrary effect may not clearly and distinctly conceive that a body fall from the cloud and which in all other respect resemble snow have yet the taste of salt or feel of fire be there any more intelligible proposition than to affirm that all the tree will flourish in december and january and decay in may and june now whatever be intelligible and can be distinctly conceive imply no contradiction and can never be prove false by any demonstrative argument or abstract reason a priori if we be therefore engage by arguments to put trust in past experience and make it the standard of our future judgement these arguments must be probable only or such as regard matter of fact and real existence accord to the division above mention but that there be no argument of this kind must appear if our explication of that species of reason be admit as solid and satisfactory we have say that all arguments concern existence be found on the relation of cause and effect that our knowledge of that relation be derive entirely from experience and that all our experimental conclusions proceed upon the supposition that the future will be conformable to the past to endeavour therefore the proof of this last supposition by probable arguments or arguments regard existence must be evidently go in a circle and take that for grant which be the very point in question in reality all arguments from experience be found on the similarity which we discover among natural object and by which we be induce to expect effect similar to those which we have find to follow from such object and though none but a fool or madman will ever pretend to dispute the authority of experience or to reject that great guide of human life it may surely be allow a philosopher to have so much curiosity at least as to examine the principle of human nature which give this mighty authority to experience and make us draw advantage from that similarity which nature have place among different object from cause which appear similar we expect similar effect this be the sum of all our experimental conclusions now it seem evident that if this conclusion be form by reason it would be as perfect at first and upon one instance as after ever so long a course of experience but the case be far otherwise nothing so like as egg yet no one on account of this appear similarity expect the same taste and relish in all of them it be only after a long course of uniform experiment in any kind that we attain a firm reliance and security with regard to a particular event now where be that process of reason which from one instance draw a conclusion so different from that which it infer from a hundred instance that be nowise different from that single one this question propose as much for the sake of information as with an intention of raise difficulties can not find can not imagine any such reason but keep my mind still open to instruction if any one will vouchsafe to bestow it on me should it be say that from a number of uniform experiment we infer a connexion between the sensible qualities and the secret power this must confess seem the same difficulty couch in different term the question still recur on what process of argument this inference be found where be the medium the interpose ideas which join proposition so very wide of each other it be confess that the colour consistence and other sensible qualities of bread appear not of themselves to have any connexion with the secret power of nourishment and support for otherwise we could infer these secret power from the first appearance of these sensible qualities without the aid of experience contrary to the sentiment of all philosophers and contrary to plain matter of fact here then be our natural state of ignorance with regard to the power and influence of all object how be this remedied by experience it only show us a number of uniform effect result from certain object and teach us that those particular object at that particular time be endow with such power and force when a new object endow with similar sensible qualities be produce we expect similar power and force and look for a like effect from a body of like colour and consistence with bread we expect like nourishment and support but this surely be a step or progress of the mind which want to be explain when a man say have find in all past instance such sensible qualities conjoin with such secret power and when he say similar sensible qualities will always be conjoin with similar secret power he be not guilty of a tautology nor be these proposition in any respect the same you say that the one proposition be an inference from the other but you must confess that the inference be not intuitive neither be it demonstrative of what nature be it then to say it be experimental be beg the question for all inferences from experience suppose as their foundation that the future will resemble the past and that similar power will be conjoin with similar sensible qualities if there be any suspicion that the course of nature may change and that the past may be no rule for the future all experience become useless and can give rise to no inference or conclusion it be impossible therefore that any arguments from experience can prove this resem blance of the past to the future since all these arguments be found on the supposition of that resemblance let the course of things be allow hitherto ever so regular that alone without some new argument or inference prove not that for the future it will continue so in vain do you pretend to have learn the nature of body from your past experience their secret nature and consequently all their effect and influence may change without any change in their sensible qualities this happen sometimes and with regard to some object why may it not happen always and with regard to all object what logic what process of argument secure you against this supposition my practice you say refute my doubt but you mistake the purport of my question as an agent be quite satisfy in the point but as a philosopher who have some share of curiosity will not say scepticism want to learn the foundation of this inference no read no enquiry have yet be able to remove my difficulty or give me satisfaction in a matter of such importance can do better than propose the difficulty to the public even though perhaps have small hop of obtain a solution we shall at least by this mean be sensible of our ignorance if we do not augment our knowledge must confess that a man be guilty of unpardonable arrogance who conclude because an argument have escape his own investigation that therefore it do not really exist must also confess that though all the learn for several age should have employ themselves in fruitless search upon any subject it may still perhaps be rash to conclude positively that the subject must therefore pass all human comprehension even though we examine all the source of our knowledge and conclude them unfit for such a subject there may still remain a suspicion that the enumeration be not complete or the examination not accurate but with regard to the present subject there be some considerations which seem to remove all this accusation of arrogance or suspicion of mistake it be certain that the most ignorant and stupid peasants nay infants nay even brute beasts improve by experience and learn the qualities of natural object by observe the effect which result from them when a child have felt the sensation of pain from touch the flame of a candle he will be careful not to put his hand near any candle but will expect a similar effect from a cause which be similar in its sensible qualities and appearance if you assert therefore that the understand of the child be lead into this conclusion by any process of argument or ratiocination may justly require you to produce that argument nor have you any pretence to refuse so equitable a demand you can not say that the argument be abstruse and may possibly escape your enquiry since you confess that it be obvious to the capacity of a mere infant if you hesitate therefore a moment or if after reflection you produce any intricate or profound argument you in a manner give up the question and confess that it be not reason which engage us to suppose the past resemble the future and to expect similar effect from cause which be to appearance similar this be the proposition which intend to enforce in the present section if be right pretend not to have make any mighty discovery and if be wrong must acknowledge myself to be indeed a very backward scholar since can not now discover an argument which it seem be perfectly familiar to me long before be out of my cradle sect sceptical solution of these doubt part the passion for philosophy like that for religion seem liable to this inconvenience that though it aim at the correction of our manners and extirpation of our vices it may only serve by imprudent management to foster a predominant inclination and push the mind with more determine resolution towards that side which already draw too much by the bias and propensity of the natural temper it be certain that while we aspire to the magnanimous firmness of the philosophic sage and endeavour to confine our pleasures altogether within our own mind we may at last render our philosophy like that of epictetus and other stoics only a more refine system of selfishness and reason ourselves out of all virtue as well as social enjoyment while we study with attention the vanity of human life and turn all our thoughts towards the empty and transitory nature of riches and honour we be perhaps all the while flatter our natural indolence which hat the bustle of the world and drudgery of business seek a pretence of reason to give itself a full and uncontrolled indulgence there be however one species of philosophy which seem little liable to this inconvenience and that because it strike in with no disorderly passion of the human mind nor can mingle itself with any natural affection or propensity and that be the academic or sceptical philosophy the academics always talk of doubt and suspense of judgement of danger in hasty determinations of confine to very narrow bound the enquiries of the understand and of renounce all speculations which lie not within the limit of common life and practice nothing therefore can be more contrary than such a philosophy to the supine indolence of the mind its rash arrogance its lofty pretensions and its superstitious credulity every passion be mortify by it except the love of truth and that passion never be nor can be carry to too high a degree it be surprise therefore that this philosophy which in almost every instance must be harmless and innocent should be the subject of so much groundless reproach and obloquy but perhaps the very circumstance which render it so innocent be what chiefly expose it to the public hatred and resentment by flatter no irregular passion it gain few partizans by oppose so many vices and follies it raise to itself abundance of enemies who stigmatize it as libertine profane and irreligious nor need we fear that this philosophy while it endeavour to limit our enquiries to common life should ever undermine the reason of common life and carry its doubt so far as to destroy all action as well as speculation nature will always maintain her right and prevail in the end over any abstract reason whatsoever though we should conclude for instance as in the forego section that in all reason from experience there be a step take by the mind which be not support by any argument or process of the understand there be no danger that these reason on which almost all knowledge depend will ever be affect by such a discovery if the mind be not engage by argument to make this step it must be induce by some other principle of equal weight and authority and that principle will preserve its influence as long as human nature remain the same what that principle be may well be worth the pain of enquiry suppose a person though endow with the strongest faculties of reason and reflection to be bring on a sudden into this world he would indeed immediately observe a continual succession of object and one event follow another but he would not be able to discover anything farther he would not at first by any reason be able to reach the idea of cause and effect since the particular power by which all natural operations be perform never appear to the sense nor be it reasonable to conclude merely because one event in one instance precede another that therefore the one be the cause the other the effect their conjunction may be arbitrary and casual there may be no reason to infer the existence of one from the appearance of the other and in a word such a person without more experience could never employ his conjecture or reason concern any matter of fact or be assure of anything beyond what be immediately present to his memory and sense suppose again that he have acquire more experience and have live so long in the world as to have observe familiar object or events to be constantly conjoin together what be the consequence of this experience he immediately infer the existence of one object from the appearance of the other yet he have not by all his experience acquire any idea or knowledge of the secret power by which the one object produce the other nor be it by any process of reason he be engage to draw this inference but still he find himself determine to draw it and though he should be convince that his understand have no part in the operation he would nevertheless continue in the same course of think there be some other principle which determine him to form such a conclusion this principle be custom or habit for wherever the repetition of any particular act or operation produce a propensity to renew the same act or operation without be impel by any reason or process of the understand we always say that this propensity be the effect of custom by employ that word we pretend not to have give the ultimate reason of such a propensity we only point out a principle of human nature which be universally acknowledge and which be well know by its effect perhaps we can push our enquiries no farther or pretend to give the cause of this cause but must rest content with it as the ultimate principle which we can assign of all our conclusions from experience it be sufficient satisfaction that we can go so far without repine at the narrowness of our faculties because they will carry us no farther and it be certain we here advance a very intelligible proposition at least if not a true one when we assert that after the constant conjunction of two object heat and flame for instance weight and solidity we be determine by custom alone to expect the one from the appearance of the other this hypothesis seem even the only one which explain the difficulty why we draw from a thousand instance an inference which we be not able to draw from one instance that be in no respect different from them reason be incapable of any such variation the conclusions which it draw from consider one circle be the same which it would form upon survey all the circle in the universe but no man have see only one body move after be impel by another could infer that every other body will move after a like impulse all inferences from experience therefore be effect of custom not of reason the same distinction between reason and experience be maintain in all our deliberations concern the conduct of life while the experience statesman general physician or merchant be trust and follow and the unpractised novice with whatever natural talents endow neglect and despise though it be allow that reason may form very plausible conjecture with regard to the consequences of such a particular conduct in such particular circumstances it be still suppose imperfect without the assistance of experience which be alone able to give stability and certainty to the maxims derive from study and reflection but notwithstanding that this distinction be thus universally receive both in the active speculative scenes of life shall not scruple to pronounce that it be at bottom erroneous at least superficial if we examine those arguments which in any of the sciences above mention be suppose to be mere effect of reason and reflection they will be find to terminate at last in some general principle or conclusion for which we can assign no reason but observation and experience the only difference between them and those maxims which be vulgarly esteem the result of pure experience be that the former can not be establish without some process of think and some reflection on what we have observe in order to distinguish its circumstances and trace its consequences whereas in the latter the experience event be exactly and fully familiar to that which we infer as the result of any particular situation the history of a tiberius or a nero make us dread a like tyranny be our monarchs free from the restraints of laws and senates but the observation of any fraud or cruelty in private life be sufficient with the aid of a little think to give us the same apprehension while it serve as an instance of the general corruption of human nature and show us the danger which we must incur by repose an entire confidence in mankind in both case it be experience which be ultimately the foundation of our inference and conclusion there be no man so young and unexperienced as not to have form from observation many general and just maxims concern human affairs and the conduct of life but it must be confess that when a man come to put these in practice he will be extremely liable to error till time and farther experience both enlarge these maxims and teach him their proper use and application in every situation or incident there be many particular and seemingly minute circumstances which the man of greatest talent be at first apt to overlook though on them the justness of his conclusions and consequently the prudence of his con duct entirely depend not to mention that to a young beginner the general observations and maxims occur not always on the proper occasion nor can be immediately apply with due calmness and distinction the truth be an unexperienced reasoner could be no reasoner at all be he absolutely unexperienced and when we assign that character to any one we mean it only in a comparative sense and suppose him possess of experience in a smaller and more imperfect degree custom then be the great guide of human life it be that principle alone which render our experience useful to us and make us expect for the future a similar train of events with those which have appear in the past without the influence of custom we should be entirely ignorant of every matter of fact beyond what be immediately present to the memory and sense we should never know how to adjust mean to end or to employ our natural power in the production of any effect there would be an end at once of all action as well as of the chief part of speculation but here it may be proper to remark that though our conclusions from experience carry us beyond our memory and sense and assure us of matter of fact which happen in the most distant place and most remote age yet some fact must always be present to the sense or memory from which we may first proceed in draw these conclusions a man who should find in a desert country the remain of pompous build would conclude that the country have in ancient time be cultivate by civilize inhabitants but do nothing of this nature occur to him he could never form such an inference we learn the events of former age from history but then we must peruse the volumes in which this instruction be contain and thence carry up our inferences from one testimony to another till we arrive at the eyewitness and spectators of these distant events in a word if we proceed not upon some fact present to the memory or sense our reason would be merely hypothetical and however the particular link might be connect with each other the whole chain of inferences would have nothing to support it nor could we ever by its mean arrive at the knowledge of any real existence if ask why you believe any particular matter of fact which you relate you must tell me some reason and this reason will be some other fact connect with it but as you can not proceed after this manner in infinitum you must at last terminate in some fact which be present to your memory or sense or must allow that your belief be entirely without foundation what then be the conclusion of the whole matter a simple one though it must be confess pretty remote from the common theories of philosophy all belief of matter of fact or real existence be derive merely from some object present to the memory or sense and a customary conjunction between that and some other object or in other word have find in many instance that any two kinds of objectsflame and heat snow and cold have always be conjoin together if flame or snow be present anew to the sense the mind be carry by custom to expect heat or cold and to believe that such a quality do exist and will discover itself upon a nearer approach this belief be the necessary result of place the mind in such circumstances it be an operation of the soul when we be so situate as unavoidable as to feel the passion of love when we receive benefit or hatred when we meet with injuries all these operations be a species of natural instincts which no reason or process of the think and understand be able either to produce or to prevent at this point it would be very allowable for us to stop our philosophical research in most question we can never make a single step further and in all question we must terminate here at last after our most restless and curious enquiries but still our curiosity will be pardonable perhaps commendable if it carry us on to still farther research and make us examine more accurately the nature of this belief and of the customary conjunction whence it be derive by this mean we may meet with some explications and analogies that will give satisfaction at least to such as love the abstract sciences and can be entertain with speculations which however accurate may still retain a degree of doubt and uncertainty as to readers of a different taste the remain part of this section be not calculate for them and the follow enquiries may well be understand though it be neglect part nothing be more free than the imagination of man and though it can not exceed that original stock of ideas furnish by the internal and external sense it have unlimited power of mix compound separate and divide these ideas in all the varieties of fiction and vision it can feign a train of events with all the appearance of reality ascribe to them a particular time and place conceive them as existent and paint them out to itself with every circumstance that belong to any historical fact which it believe with the greatest certainty wherein therefore consist the difference between such a fiction and belief it lie not merely in any peculiar idea which be annex to such a conception as command our assent and which be want to every know fiction for as the mind have authority over all its ideas it could voluntarily annex this particular idea to any fiction and consequently be able to believe whatever it please contrary to what we find by daily experience we can in our conception join the head of a man to the body of a horse but it be not in our power to believe that such an animal have ever really exist it follow therefore that the difference between fiction and belief lie in some sentiment or feel which be annex to the latter not to the former and which depend not on the will nor can be command at pleasure it must be excite by nature like all other sentiments and must arise from the particular situation in which the mind be place at any particular juncture whenever any object be present to the memory or sense it immediately by the force of custom carry the imagination to conceive that object which be usually conjoin to it and this conception be attend with a feel or sentiment different from the loose reveries of the fancy in this consist the whole nature of belief for as there be no matter of fact which we believe so firmly that we can not conceive the contrary there would be no difference between the conception assent to and that which be reject be it not for some sentiment which distinguish the one from the other if see a billiardball move towards another on a smooth table can easily conceive it to stop upon contact this conception imply no contradiction but still it feel very differently from that conception by which represent to myself the impulse and the communication of motion from one ball to another be we to attempt a definition of this sentiment we should perhaps find it a very difficult if not an impossible task in the same manner as if we should endeavour to define the feel of cold or passion of anger to a creature who never have any experience of these sentiments belief be the true and proper name of this feel and no one be ever at a loss to know the mean of that term because every man be every moment conscious of the sentiment represent by it it may not however be improper to attempt a description of this sentiment in hop we may by that mean arrive at some analogies which may afford a more perfect explication of it say then that belief be nothing but a more vivid lively forcible firm steady conception of an object than what the imagination alone be ever able to attain this variety of term which may seem so unphilosophical be intend only to express that act of the mind which render realities or what be take for such more present to us than fictions cause them to weigh more in the think and give them a superior influence on the passions and imagination provide we agree about the thing it be needle to dispute about the term the imagination have the command over all its ideas and can join and mix and vary them in all the ways possible it may conceive fictitious object with all the circumstances of place and time it may set them in a manner before our eye in their true colour just as they might have exist but as it be impossible that this faculty of imagination can ever of itself reach belief it be evident that belief consist not in the peculiar nature or order of ideas but in the manner of their conception and in their feel to the mind confess that it be impossible perfectly to explain this feel or manner of conception we may make use of word which express something near it but its true and proper name as we observe before be belief which be a term that every one sufficiently understand in common life and in philosophy we can go no farther than assert that belief be something felt by the mind which distinguish the ideas of the judgement from the fictions of the imagination it give them more weight and influence make them appear of greater importance enforce them in the mind and render them the govern principle of our action hear at present for instance a persons voice with whom be acquaint and the sound come as from the next room this impression of my sense immediately convey my think to the person together with all the surround object paint them out to myself as exist at present with the same qualities and relations of which formerly know them possess these ideas take faster hold of my mind than ideas of an enchant castle they be very different to the feel and have a much greater influence of every kind either to give pleasure or pain joy or sorrow let us then take in the whole compass of this doctrine and allow that the sentiment of belief be nothing but a conception more intense and steady than what attend the mere fictions of the imagination and that this manner of conception arise from a customary conjunction of the object with something present to the memory or sense believe that it will not be difficult upon these suppositions to find other operations of the mind analogous to it and to trace up these phenomena to principles still more general we have already observe that nature have establish connexions among particular ideas and that no sooner one idea occur to our thoughts than it introduce its correlative and carry our attention towards it by a gentle and insensible movement these principles of connexion or association we have reduce to three namely resemblance contiguity and causation which be the only bond that unite our thoughts together and beget that regular train of reflection or discourse which in a greater or less degree take place among all mankind now here arise a question on which the solution of the present difficulty will depend do it happen in all these relations that when one of the object be present to the sense or memory the mind be not only carry to the conception of the correlative but reach a steadier and stronger conception of it than what otherwise it would have be able to attain this seem to be the case with that belief which arise from the relation of cause and effect and if the case be the same with the other relations or principles of associations this may be establish as a general law which take place in all the operations of the mind we may therefore observe as the first experiment to our present purpose that upon the appearance of the picture of an absent friend our idea of him be evidently enliven by the resemblance and that every passion which that idea occasion whether of joy or sorrow acquire new force and vigour in produce this effect there concur both a relation and a present impression where the picture bear him no resemblance at least be not intend for him it never so much as convey our think to him and where it be absent as well as the person though the mind may pass from the think of the one to that of the other it feel its idea to be rather weaken than enliven by that transition we take a pleasure in view the picture of a friend when it be set before us but when it be remove rather choose to consider him directly than by reflection in an image which be equally distant and obscure the ceremonies of the roman catholic religion may be consider as instance of the same nature the devote of that superstition usually plead in excuse for the mummeries with which they be upbraid that they feel the good effect of those external motion and posture and action in enliven their devotion and quicken their fervour which otherwise would decay if direct entirely to distant and immaterial object we shadow out the object of our faith say they in sensible type and image and render them more present to us by the immediate presence of these type than it be possible for us to do merely by an intellectual view and contemplation sensible object have always a greater influence on the fancy than any other and this influence they readily convey to those ideas to which they be relate and which they resemble shall only infer from these practice and this reason that the effect of resemblance in enliven the ideas be very common and as in every case a resemblance and a present impression must concur we be abundantly supply with experiment to prove the reality of the forego principle we may add force to these experiment by others of a different kind in consider the effect of contiguity as well as of resemblance it be certain that distance diminish the force of every idea and that upon our approach to any object though it do not discover itself to our sense it operate upon the mind with an influence which imitate an immediate impression the think on any object readily transport the mind to what be contiguous but it be only the actual presence of an object that transport it with a superior vivacity when be a few miles from home whatever relate to it touch me more nearly than when be two hundred league distant though even at that distance the reflect on anything in the neighbourhood of my friends or family naturally produce an idea of them but as in this latter case both the object of the mind be ideas notwithstanding there be an easy transition between them that transition alone be not able to give a superior vivacity to any of the ideas for want of some immediate impression no one can doubt but causation have the same influence as the other two relations of resemblance and contiguity superstitious people be fond of the reliques of saint and holy men for the same reason that they seek after type or image in order to enliven their devotion and give them a more intimate and strong conception of those exemplary live which they desire to imitate now it be evident that one of the best reliques which a devotee could procure would be the handywork of a saint and if his cloaths and furniture be ever to be consider in this light it be because they be once at his disposal and be move and affect by him in which respect they be to be consider as imperfect effect and as connect with him by a shorter chain of consequences than any of those by which we learn the reality of his existence suppose that the son of a friend who have be long dead or absent be present to us it be evident that this object would instantly revive its correlative idea and recal to our thoughts all past intimacies and familiarities in more lively colour than they would otherwise have ap peared to us this be another phaenomenon which seem to prove the principle above mention we may observe that in these phaenomena the belief of the correlative object be always presuppose without which the relation could have no effect the influence of the picture suppose that we believe our friend to have once exist continguity to home can never excite our ideas of home unless we believe that it really exist now assert that this belief where it reach beyond the memory or sense be of a similar nature and arise from similar cause with the transition of think and vivacity of conception here explain when throw a piece of dry wood into a fire my mind be immediately carry to conceive that it augment not extinguish the flame this transition of think from the cause to the effect proceed not from reason it derive its origin altogether from custom and experience and as it first begin from an object present to the sense it render the idea or conception of flame more strong and lively than any loose float reverie of the imagination that idea arise immediately the think move instantly towards it and convey to it all that force of conception which be derive from the impression present to the sense when a sword be level at my breast do not the idea of wind and pain strike me more strongly than when a glass of wine be present to me even though by accident this idea should occur after the appearance of the latter object but what be there in this whole matter to cause such a strong conception except only a present object and a customary transition to the idea of another object which we have be accustom to conjoin with the former this be the whole operation of the mind in all our conclusions concern matter of fact and existence and it be a satisfaction to find some analogies by which it may be explain the transition from a present object do in all case give strength and solidity to the relate idea here then be a kind of preestablished harmony between the course of nature and the succession of our ideas and though the power and force by which the former be govern be wholly unknown to us yet our thoughts and conceptions have still we find go on in the same train with the other work of nature custom be that principle by which this correspondence have be effect so necessary to the subsistence of our species and the regulation of our conduct in every circumstance and occurrence of human life have not the presence of an object instantly excite the idea of those object commonly conjoin with it all our knowledge must have be limit to the narrow sphere of our memory and sense and we should never have be able to adjust mean to end or employ our natural power either to the produce of good or avoid of evil those who delight in the discovery and contemplation of final cause have here ample subject to employ their wonder and admiration shall add for a further confirmation of the forego theory that as this operation of the mind by which we infer like effect from like cause and vice versa be so essential to the subsistence of all human creatures it be not probable that it could be trust to the fallacious deductions of our reason which be slow in its operations appear not in any degree during the first years of infancy and at best be in every age and period of human life extremely liable to error and mistake it be more conformable to the ordinary wisdom of nature to secure so necessary an act of the mind by some instinct or mechanical tendency which may be infallible in its operations may discover itself at the first appearance of life and think and may be independent of all the labour deductions of the understand as nature have teach us the use of our limbs without give us the knowledge of the muscle and nerve by which they be actuate so have she implant in us an instinct which carry forward the think in a correspondent course to that which she have establish among external object though we be ignorant of those power and force on which this regular course and succession of object totally depend sect of probability though there be no such thing as chance in the world our ignorance of the real cause of any event have the same influence on the understand and beget a like species of belief or opinion there be certainly a probability which arise from a superiority of chance on any side and accord as this superiority encreases and surpass the opposite chance the probability receive a proportionable encrease and beget still a higher degree of belief or assent to that side in which we discover the superiority if a die be mark with one figure or number of spot on four side and with another figure or number of spot on the two remain side it would be more probable that the former would turn up than the latter though if it have a thousand side mark in the same manner and only one side different the probability would be much higher and our belief or expectation of the event more steady and secure this process of the think or reason may seem trivial and obvious but to those who consider it more narrowly it may perhaps afford matter for curious speculation it seem evident that when the mind look forward to discover the event which may result from the throw of such a die it consider the turn up of each particular side as alike probable and this the very nature of chance to render all the particular events comprehend in it entirely equal but find a greater number of side concur in the one event than in the other the mind be carry more frequently to that event and meet it oftener in revolve the various possibilities or chance on which the ultimate result depend this concurrence of several view in one particular event beget immediately by an inexplicable contrivance of nature the sentiment of belief and give that event the advantage over its antagonist which be support by a smaller number of view and recur less frequently to the mind if we allow that belief be nothing but a firmer and stronger conception of an object than what attend the mere fictions of the imagination this operation may perhaps in some measure be account for the concurrence of these several view or glimpse imprint the idea more strongly on the imagination give it superior force and vigour render its influence on the passions and affections more sensible and in a word beget that reliance or security which constitute the nature of belief and opinion the case be the same with the probability of cause as with that of chance there be some cause which be entirely uniform and constant in produce a particular effect and no instance have ever yet be find of any failure or irregularity in their operation fire have always burn and water suffocate every human creature the production of motion by impulse and gravity be an universal law which have hitherto admit of no exception but there be other cause which have be find more irregular and uncertain nor have rhubarb always prove a purge or opium a soporific to every one who have take these medicine it be true when any cause fail of produce its usual effect philosophers ascribe not this to any irregularity in nature but suppose that some secret cause in the particular structure of part have prevent the operation our reason however and conclusions concern the event be the same as if this principle have no place be determine by custom to transfer the past to the future in all our inferences where the past have be entirely regular and uniform we expect the event with the greatest assurance and leave no room for any contrary supposition but where different effect have be find to follow from cause which be to appearance exactly similar all these various effect must occur to the mind in transfer the past to the future and enter into our consideration when we determine the probability of the event though we give the preference to that which have be find most usual and believe that this effect will exist we must not overlook the other effect but must assign to each of them a particular weight and authority in proportion as we have find it to be more or less frequent it be more probable in almost every country of europe that there will be frost sometime in january than that the weather will continue open throughout that whole month though this probability vary accord to the different climates and approach to a certainty in the more northern kingdoms here then it seem evident that when we transfer the past to the future in order to determine the effect which will result from any cause we transfer all the different events in the same proportion as they have appear in the past and conceive one to have exist a hundred time for instance another ten time and another once as a great number of view do here concur in one event they fortify and confirm it to the imagination beget that sentiment which we call belief and give its object the preference above the contrary event which be not support by an equal number of experiment and recur not so frequently to the think in transfer the past to the future let any one try to account for this operation of the mind upon any of the receive systems of philosophy and he will be sensible of the difficulty for my part shall think it sufficient if the present hint excite the curiosity of philosophers and make them sensible how defective all common theories be in treat of such curious and such sublime subject sect of the idea of necessary connexion part the great advantage of the mathematical sciences above the moral consist in this that the ideas of the former be sensible be always clear and determinate the smallest distinction between them be immediately perceptible and the same term be still expressive of the same ideas without ambiguity or variation an oval be never mistake for a circle nor an hyperbola for an ellipsis the isosceles and scalenum be distinguish by boundaries more exact than vice and virtue right and wrong if any term be define in geometry the mind readily of itself substitute on all occasion the definition for the term define or even when no definition be employ the object itself may be present to the sense and by that mean be steadily and clearly apprehend but the finer sentiments of the mind the operations of the understand the various agitations of the passions though really in themselves distinct easily escape us when survey by reflection nor be it in our power to recal the original object as often as we have occasion to contemplate it ambiguity by this mean be gradually introduce into our reason similar object be readily take to be the same and the conclusion become at last very wide of the premise one may safely however affirm that if we consider these sciences in a proper light their advantage and disadvantage nearly compensate each other and reduce both of them to a state of equality if the mind with greater facility retain the ideas of geometry clear and determinate it must carry on a much longer and more intricate chain of reason and compare ideas much wider of each other in order to reach the abstruser truths of that science and if moral ideas be apt without extreme care to fall into obscurity and confusion the inferences be always much shorter in these disquisitions and the intermediate step which lead to the conclusion much fewer than in the sciences which treat of quantity and number in reality there be scarcely a proposition in euclid so simple as not to consist of more part than be to be find in any moral reason which run not into chimera and conceit where we trace the principles of the human mind through a few step we may be very well satisfy with our progress consider how soon nature throw a bar to all our enquiries concern cause and reduce us to an acknowledgment of our ignorance the chief obstacle therefore to our improvement in the moral or metaphysical sciences be the obscurity of the ideas and ambiguity of the term the principal difficulty in the mathematics be the length of inferences and compass of think requisite to the form of any conclusion and perhaps our progress in natural philosophy be chiefly retard by the want of proper experiment and phaenomena which be often discover by chance and can not always be find when requisite even by the most diligent and prudent enquiry as moral philosophy seem hitherto to have receive less improvement than either geometry or physics we may conclude that if there be any difference in this respect among these sciences the difficulties which obstruct the progress of the former require superior care and capacity to be surmount there be no ideas which occur in metaphysics more obscure and uncertain than those of power force energy or necessary connexion of which it be every moment necessary for us to treat in all our disquisitions we shall therefore endeavour in this section to fix if possible the precise mean of these term and thereby remove some part of that obscurity which be so much complain of in this species of philosophy it seem a proposition which will not admit of much dispute that all our ideas be nothing but copy of our impressions or in other word that it be impossible for us to think of anything which we have not antecedently felt either by our external or internal sense have endeavour to explain and prove this proposition and have express my hop that by a proper application of it men may reach a greater clearness and precision in philosophical reason than what they have hitherto be able to attain complex ideas may perhaps be well know by definition which be nothing but an enumeration of those part or simple ideas that compose them but when we have push up definitions to the most simple ideas and find still some ambiguity and obscurity what resource be we then possess of by what invention can we throw light upon these ideas and render them altogether precise and determinate to our intellectual view produce the impressions or original sentiments from which the ideas be copy these impressions be all strong and sensible they admit not of ambiguity they be not only place in a full light themselves but may throw light on their correspondent ideas which lie in obscurity and by this mean we may perhaps attain a new microscope or species of optics by which in the moral sciences the most minute and most simple ideas may be so enlarge as to fall readily under our apprehension and be equally know with the grossest and most sensible ideas that can be the object of our enquiry to be fully acquaint therefore with the idea of power or necessary connexion let us examine its impression and in order to find the impression with greater certainty let us search for it in all the source from which it may possibly be derive when we look about us towards external object and consider the operation of cause we be never able in a single instance to discover any power or necessary connexion any quality which bind the effect to the cause and render the one an infallible consequence of the other we only find that the one do actually in fact follow the other the impulse of one billiardball be attend with motion in the second this be the whole that appear to the outward sense the mind feel no sen timent or inward impression from this succession of object consequently there be not in any single particular instance of cause and effect anything which can suggest the idea of power or necessary connexion from the first appearance of an object we never can conjecture what effect will result from it but be the power or energy of any cause discoverable by the mind we could foresee the effect even without experience and might at first pronounce with certainty concern it by mere dint of think and reason in reality there be no part of matter that do ever by its sensible qualities discover any power or energy or give us grind to imagine that it could produce any thing or be follow by any other object which we could denominate its effect solidity extension motion these qualities be all complete in themselves and never point out any other event which may result from them the scenes of the universe be continually shift and one object follow another in an uninterrupted succession but the power of force which actuate the whole machine be entirely conceal from us and never discover itself in any of the sensible qualities of body we know that in fact heat be a constant attendant of flame but what be the connexion between them we have no room so much as to conjecture or imagine it be impossible therefore that the idea of power can be derive from the contemplation of body in single instance of their operation because no body ever discover any power which can be the original of this idea since therefore external object as they appear to the sense give us no idea of power or necessary connexion by their operation in particular instance let us see whether this idea be derive from reflection on the operations of our own mind and be copy from any internal impression it may be say that we be every moment conscious of internal power while we feel that by the simple command of our will we can move the organs of our body or direct the faculties of our mind an act of volition produce motion in our limbs or raise a new idea in our imagination this influence of the will we know by consciousness hence we acquire the idea of power or energy and be certain that we ourselves and all other intelligent be be possess of power this idea then be an idea of reflection since it arise from reflect on the operations of our own mind and on the command which be exercise by will both over the organs of the body and faculties of the soul we shall proceed to examine this pretension and first with re gard to the influence of volition over the organs of the body this influence we may observe be a fact which like all other natural events can be know only be experience and can never be foresee from any apparent energy or power in the cause which connect it with the effect and render the one an infallible consequence of the other the motion of our body follow upon the command of our will of this we be every moment conscious but the mean by which this be effect the energy by which the will perform so extraordinary an operation of this we be so far from be immediately conscious that it must for ever escape our most diligent enquiry for first be there any principle in all nature more mysterious than the union of soul with body by which a suppose spiritual substance acquire such an influence over a material one that the most refine think be able to actuate the grossest matter be we empower by a secret wish to remove mountains or control the planets in their orbit this extensive authority would not be more extraordinary nor more beyond our comprehension but if by consciousness we perceive any power or energy in the will we must know this power we must know its connexion with the effect we must know the secret union of soul and body and the nature of both these substances by which the one be able to operate in so many instance upon the other secondly we be not able to move all the organs of the body with a like authority though we can not assign any reason besides experience for so remarkable a difference between one and the other why have the will an influence over the tongue and finger not over the heart or liver this question would never embarrass us be we conscious of a power in the former case not in the latter we should then perceive independent of experience why the authority of will over the organs of the body be circumscribe within such particular limit be in that case fully acquaint with the power or force by which it operate we should also know why its influence reach precisely to such boundaries and no farther a man suddenly strike with palsy in the leg or arm or who have newly lose those members frequently endeavour at first to move them and employ them in their usual offices here he be as much conscious of power to command such limbs as a man in perfect health be conscious of power to actuate any member which remain in its natural state and condition but consciousness never deceive consequently neither in the one case nor in the other be we ever conscious of any power we learn the influence of our will from experience alone and experience only teach us how one event constantly follow another without instruct us in the secret connexion which bind them together and render them inseparable thirdly we learn from anatomy that the immediate object of power in voluntary motion be not the member itself which be move but certain muscle and nerve and animal spirit and perhaps something still more minute and more unknown through which the motion be successively propagate ere it reach the member itself whose motion be the immediate object of volition can there be a more certain proof that the power by which this whole operation be perform so far from be directly and fully know by an inward sentiment or consciousness be to the last degree mysterious and unintelligible here the mind will a certain event immediately another event unknown to ourselves and totally different from the one intend be produce this event produce another equally unknown till at last through a long succession the desire event be produce but if the original power be felt it must be know be it know its effect also must be know since all power be relative to its effect and vice versa if the effect be not know the power can not be know nor felt how indeed can we be conscious of a power to move our limbs when we have no such power but only that to move certain animal spirit which though they produce at last the motion of our limbs yet operate in such a manner as be wholly beyond our comprehension we may therefore conclude from the whole hope without any temerity though with assurance that our idea of power be not copy from any sentiment or consciousness of power within ourselves when we give rise to animal motion or apply our limbs to their proper use and office that their motion follow the command of the will be a matter of common experience like other natural events but the power or energy by which this be effect like that in other natural events be unknown and inconceivable shall we then assert that we be conscious of a power or energy in our own mind when by an act or command of our will we raise up a new idea fix the mind to the contemplation of it turn it on all side and at last dismiss it for some other idea when we think that we have survey it with sufficient accuracy believe the same arguments will prove that even this command of the will give us no real idea of force or energy first it must be allow that when we know a power we know that very circumstance in the cause by which it be enable to produce the effect for these be suppose to be synonimous we must therefore know both the cause and effect and the relation between them but do we pretend to be acquaint with the nature of the human soul and the nature of an idea or the aptitude of the one to produce the other this be a real creation a production of something out of nothing which imply a power so great that it may seem at first sight beyond the reach of any be less than infinite at least it must be own that such a power be not felt nor know nor even conceivable by the mind we only feel the event namely the existence of an idea consequent to a command of the will but the manner in which this operation be perform the power by which it be produce be entirely beyond our comprehension secondly the command of the mind over itself be limit as well as its command over the body and these limit be not know by reason or any acquaintance with the nature of cause and effect but only by experience and observation as in all other natural events and in the operation of external object our authority over our sentiments and passions be much weaker than that over our ideas and even the latter authority be circumscribe within very narrow boundaries will any one pretend to assign the ultimate reason of these boundaries or show why the power be deficient in one case not in another thirdly this selfcommand be very different at different time a man in health possess more of it than one languish with sickness we be more master of our thoughts in the morning than in the even fast than after a full meal can we give any reason for these variations except experience where then be the power of which we pretend to be conscious be there not here either in a spiritual or material substance or both some secret mechanism or structure of part upon which the effect depend and which be entirely unknown to us render the power or energy of the will equally unknown and incomprehensible volition be surely an act of the mind with which we be sufficiently acquaint reflect upon it consider it on all side do you find anything in it like this creative power by which it raise from nothing a new idea and with a kind of fiat imitate the omnipotence of its maker if may be allow so to speak who call forth into existence all the various scenes of nature so far from be conscious of this energy in the will it require as certain experience as that of which we be possess to convince us that such extraordinary effect do ever result from a simple act of volition the generality of mankind never find any difficulty in account for the more common and familiar operations of nature such as the descent of heavy body the growth of plant the generation of animals or the nourishment of body by food but suppose that in all these case they perceive the very force or energy of the cause by which it be connect with its effect and be for ever infallible in its operation they acquire by long habit such a turn of mind that upon the appearance of the cause they immediately expect with assurance its usual attendant and hardly conceive it possible that any other event could result from it it be only on the discovery of extraordinary phaenomena such as earthquakes pestilence and prodigies of any kind that they find themselves at a loss to assign a proper cause and to explain the manner in which the effect be produce by it it be usual for men in such difficulties to have recourse to some invisible intelligent principle as the immediate cause of that event which surprise them and which they think can not be account for from the common power of nature but philosophers who carry their scrutiny a little farther immediately perceive that even in the most familiar events the energy of the cause be as unintelligible as in the most unusual and that we only learn by experience the frequent conjunction of object without be ever able to comprehend anything like connexion between them here then many philosophers think themselves oblige by reason to have recourse on all occasion to the same principle which the vulgar never appeal to but in case that appear miraculous and supernatural they acknowledge mind and intelligence to be not only the ultimate and original cause of all things but the immediate and sole cause of every event which appear in nature they pretend that those object which be commonly denominate cause be in reality nothing but occasion and that the true and direct principle of every effect be not any power or force in nature but a volition of the supreme be who will that such particular object should for ever be conjoin with each other instead of say that one billiardball move another by a force which it have derive from the author of nature it be the deity himself they say who by a particular volition move the second ball be determine to this operation by the impulse of the first ball in consequence of those general laws which he have lay down to himself in the government of the universe but philosophers advance still in their inquiries discover that as we be totally ignorant of the power on which depend the mutual operation of body we be no less ignorant of that power on which depend the operation of mind on body or of body on mind nor be we able either from our sense or consciousness to assign the ultimate principle in one case more than in the other the same ignorance therefore reduce them to the same conclusion they assert that the deity be the immediate cause of the union between soul and body and that they be not the organs of sense which be agitate by external object produce sensations in the mind but that it be a particular volition of our omnipotent maker which excite such a sensation in consequence of such a motion in the organ in like manner it be not any energy in the will that produce local motion in our members it be god himself who be please to second our will in itself impotent and to command that motion which we erroneously attribute to our own power and efficacy nor do philosophers stop at this conclusion they sometimes extend the same inference to the mind itself in its internal operations our mental vision or conception of ideas be nothing but a revelation make to us by our maker when we voluntarily turn our thoughts to any object and raise up its image in the fancy it be not the will which create that idea it be the universal creator who discover it to the mind and render it present to us thus accord to these philosophers every thing be full of god not content with the principle that nothing exist but by his will that nothing possess any power but by his concession they rob nature and all create be of every power in order to render their dependence on the deity still more sensible and immediate they consider not that by this theory they diminish instead of magnify the grandeur of those attribute which they affect so much to celebrate it argue surely more power in the deity to delegate a certain degree of power to inferior creatures than to produce every thing by his own immediate volition it argue more wisdom to contrive at first the fabric of the world with such perfect foresight that of itself and by its proper operation it may serve all the purpose of providence than if the great creator be oblige every moment to adjust its part and animate by his breath all the wheel of that stupendous machine but if we would have a more philosophical confutation of this theory perhaps the two follow reflections may suffice first it seem to me that this theory of the universal energy and operation of the supreme be be too bold ever to carry conviction with it to a man sufficiently apprize of the weakness of human reason and the narrow limit to which it be confine in all its operations though the chain of arguments which conduct to it be ever so logical there must arise a strong suspicion if not an absolute assurance that it have carry us quite beyond the reach of our faculties when it lead to conclusions so extraordinary and so remote from common life and experience we be get into fairy land long ere we have reach the last step of our theory and there we have no reason to trust our common methods of argument or to think that our usual analogies and probabilities have any authority our line be too short to fathom such immense aby and however we may flatter ourselves that we be guide in every step which we take by a kind of verisimilitude and experience we may be assure that this fancy experience have no authority when we thus apply it to subject that lie entirely out of the sphere of experience but on this we shall have occasion to touch afterwards secondly can not perceive any force in the arguments on which this theory be found we be ignorant it be true of the manner in which body operate on each other their force or energy be entirely incomprehensible but be we not equally ignorant of the manner or force by which a mind even the supreme mind operate either on itself or on body whence beseech you do we acquire any idea of it we have no sentiment or consciousness of this power in ourselves we have no idea of the supreme be but what we learn from reflection on our own faculties be our ignorance therefore a good reason for reject anything we should be lead into that principle of deny all energy in the supreme be as much as in the grossest matter we surely comprehend as little the operations of one as of the other be it more difficult to conceive that motion may arise from impulse than that it may arise from volition all we know be our profound ignorance in both case part but to hasten to a conclusion of this argument which be already draw out to too great a length we have seek in vain for an idea of power or necessary connexion in all the source from which we could suppose it to be derive it appear that in single instance of the operation of body we never can by our utmost scrutiny discover anything but one event follow another without be able to comprehend any force or power by which the cause operate or any connexion between it and its suppose effect the same difficulty occur in contemplate the operations of mind on body where we observe the motion of the latter to follow upon the volition of the former but be not able to observe or conceive the tie which bind together the motion and volition or the energy by which the mind produce this effect the authority of the will over its own faculties and ideas be not a whit more comprehensible so that upon the whole there appear not throughout all nature any one instance of connexion which be conceivable by us all events seem entirely loose and separate one event follow another but we never can observe any tie between them they seem conjoin but never connect and as we can have no idea of any thing which never appear to our outward sense or inward sentiment the necessary conclusion seem to be that we have no idea of connexion or power at all and that these word be absolutely without any mean when employ either in philosophical reason or common life but there still remain one method of avoid this conclusion and one source which we have not yet examine when any natural object or event be present it be impossible for us by any sagacity or penetration to discover or even conjecture without experience what event will result from it or to carry our foresight beyond that object which be immediately present to the memory and sense even after one instance or experiment where we have observe a particular event to follow upon another we be not entitle to form a general rule or foretell what will happen in like case it be justly esteem an unpardonable temerity to judge of the whole course of nature from one single experiment however accurate or certain but when one particular species of event have always in all instance be conjoin with another we make no any scruple of foretell one upon the appearance of the other and of employ that reason which can alone assure us of any matter of fact or existence we then call the one object cause the other effect we suppose that there be some connexion between them some power in the one by which it infallibly produce the other and operate with the greatest certainty and strongest necessity it appear then that this idea of a necessary connexion among events arise from a number of similar instance which occur of the constant conjunction of these events nor can that idea ever be suggest by any one of these instance survey in all possible light and position but there be nothing in a number of instance different from every single instance which be suppose to be exactly similar except only that after a repetition of similar instance the mind be carry by habit upon the appearance of one event to expect its usual attendant and to believe that it will exist this connexion therefore which we feel in the mind this customary transition of the imagination from one object to its usual attendant be the sentiment or impression from which we form the idea of power or necessary connexion nothing farther be in the case contemplate the subject on all side you will never find any other origin of that idea this be the sole difference between one instance from which we can never receive the idea of connexion and a number of similar instance by which it be suggest the first time a man saw the communication of motion by impulse as by the shock of two billiard ball he could not pronounce that the one event be connect but only that it be conjoin with the other after he have observe several instance of this nature he then pronounce them to be connect what alteration have happen to give rise to this new idea of connexion nothing but that he now feel these events to be connect in his imagination and can readily foretell the existence of one from the appearance of the other when we say therefore that one object be connect with another we mean only that they have acquire a connexion in our think and give rise to this inference by which they become proof of each others existence a conclusion which be somewhat extraordinary but which seem found on sufficient evidence nor will its evidence be weaken by any general diffidence of the understand or sceptical suspicion concern every conclusion which be new and extraordinary no conclusions can be more agreeable to scepticism than such as make discoveries concern the weakness and narrow limit of human reason and capacity and what stronger instance can be produce of the surprise ignorance and weakness of the understand than the present for surely if there be any relation among object which it import to us to know perfectly it be that of cause and effect on this be found all our reason concern matter of fact or existence by mean of it alone we attain any assurance concern object which be remove from the present testimony of our memory and sense the only immediate utility of all sciences be to teach us how to control and regulate future events by their cause our thoughts and enquiries be therefore every moment employ about this relation yet so imperfect be the ideas which we form concern it that it be impossible to give any just definition of cause except what be draw from something extraneous and foreign to it similar object be always conjoin with similar of this we have experience suitably to this experience therefore we may define a cause to be an object follow by another and where all the object similar to the first be follow by object similar to the second or in other word where if the first object have not be the second never have exist the appearance of a cause always convey the mind by a customary transition to the idea of the effect of this also we have experience we may therefore suitably to this experience form another definition of cause and call it an object follow by another and whose appearance always convey the think to that other but though both these definitions be draw from circumstances foreign to the cause we can not remedy this inconvenience or attain any more perfect definition which may point out that circumstance in the cause which give it a connexion with its effect we have no idea of this connexion nor even any distinct notion what it be we desire to know when we endeavour at a conception of it we say for instance that the vibration of this string be the cause of this particular sound but what do we mean by that affirmation we either mean that this vibration be follow by this sound and that all similar vibrations have be follow by similar sound or that this vibration be follow by this sound and that upon the appearance of one the mind anticipate the sense and form immediately an idea of the other we may consider the relation of cause and effect in either of these two light but beyond these we have no idea of it as to the frequent use of the word force power energy c which every where occur in common conversation as well as in philosophy that be no proof that we be acquaint in any instance with the connect principle between cause and effect or can account ultimately for the production of one thing to another these word as commonly use have very loose mean annex to them and their ideas be very uncertain and confuse no animal can put external body in motion without the sentiment of a nisus or endeavour and every animal have a sentiment or feel from the stroke or blow of an external object that be in motion these sensations which be merely animal and from which we can a priori draw no inference we be apt to transfer to inanimate object and to suppose that they have some such feel whenever they transfer or receive motion with regard to energies which be exert without our annex to them any idea of communicate motion we consider only the constant experience conjunction of the events and as we feel a customary connexion between the ideas we transfer that feel to the object as nothing be more usual than to apply to external body every internal sensation which they occasion to recapitulate therefore the reason of this section every idea be copy from some precede impression or sentiment and where we can not find any impression we may be certain that there be no idea in all single instance of the operation of body or mind there be nothing that produce any impression nor consequently can suggest any idea of power or necessary connexion but when many uniform instance appear and the same object be always follow by the same event we then begin to entertain the notion of cause and connexion we then feel a new sentiment or impression to wit a customary connexion in the think or imagination between one object and its usual attendant and this sentiment be the original of that idea which we seek for for as this idea arise from a number of similar instance and not from any single instance it must arise from that circumstance in which the number of instance differ from every individual instance but this customary connexion or transition of the imagination be the only circumstance in which they differ in every other particular they be alike the first instance which we saw of motion communicate by the shock of two billiard ball to return to this obvious illustration be exactly similar to any instance that may at present occur to us except only that we could not at first infer one event from the other which we be enable to do at present after so long a course of uniform experience know not whether the reader will readily apprehend this reason be afraid that should multiply word about it or throw it into a greater variety of light it would only become more obscure and intricate in all abstract reason there be one point of view which if we can happily hit we shall go farther towards illustrate the subject than by all the eloquence and copious expression in the world this point of view we should endeavour to reach and reserve the flower of rhetoric for subject which be more adapt to them sect of liberty and necessity part it might reasonably be expect in question which have be canvass and dispute with great eagerness since the first origin of science and philosophy that the mean of all the term at least should have be agree upon among the disputants and our enquiries in the course of two thousand years be able to pass from word to the true and real subject of the controversy for how easy may it seem to give exact definitions of the term employ in reason and make these definitions not the mere sound of word the object of future scrutiny and examination but if we consider the matter more narrowly we shall be apt to draw a quite opposite conclusion from this circumstance alone that a controversy have be long keep on foot and remain still undecided we may presume that there be some ambiguity in the expression and that the disputants affix different ideas to the term employ in the controversy for as the faculties of the mind be suppose to be naturally alike in every individual otherwise nothing could be more fruitless than to reason or dispute together it be impossible if men affix the same ideas to their term that they could so long form different opinions of the same subject especially when they communicate their view and each party turn themselves on all side in search of arguments which may give them the victory over their antagonists it be true if men attempt the discussion of question which lie entirely beyond the reach of human capacity such as those concern the origin of worlds or the economy of the intellectual system or region of spirit they may long beat the air in their fruitless contest and never arrive at any determinate conclusion but if the question regard any subject of common life and experience nothing one would think could preserve the dispute so long undecided but some ambiguous expressions which keep the antagonists still at a distance and hinder them from grapple with each other this have be the case in the long dispute question concern liberty and necessity and to so remarkable a degree that if be not much mistake we shall find that all mankind both learn and ignorant have always be of the same opinion with regard to this subject and that a few intelligible definitions would immediately have put an end to the whole controversy own that this dispute have be so much canvass on all hand and have lead philosophers into such a labyrinth of obscure sophistry that it be no wonder if a sensible reader indulge his ease so far as to turn a deaf ear to the proposal of such a question from which he can expect neither instruction or entertainment but the state of the argument here propose may perhaps serve to renew his attention as it have more novelty promise at least some decision of the controversy and will not much disturb his ease by any intricate or obscure reason hope therefore to make it appear that all men have ever agree in the doctrine both of necessity and of liberty accord to any reason able sense which can be put on these term and that the whole controversy have hitherto turn merely upon word we shall begin with examine the doctrine of necessity it be universally allow that matter in all its operations be actuate by a necessary force and that every natural effect be so precisely determine by the energy of its cause that no other effect in such particular circumstances could possibly have result from it the degree and direction of every motion be by the laws of nature prescribe with such exactness that a live creature may as soon arise from the shock of two body in motion in any other degree or direction than what be actually produce by it would we therefore form a just and precise idea of necessity we must consider whence that idea arise when we apply it to the operation of body it seem evident that if all the scenes of nature be continually shift in such a manner that no two events bore any resemblance to each other but every object be entirely new without any similitude to whatever have be see before we should never in that case have attain the least idea of necessity or of a connexion among these object we might say upon such a supposition that one object or event have follow another not that one be produce by the other the relation of cause and effect must be utterly unknown to mankind inference and reason concern the operations of nature would from that moment be at an end and the memory and sense remain the only canal by which the knowledge of any real existence could possibly have access to the mind our idea therefore of necessity and causation arise entirely from the uniformity observable in the operations of nature where similar object be constantly conjoin together and the mind be determine by custom to infer the one from the appearance of the other these two circumstances form the whole of that necessity which we ascribe to matter beyond the constant conjunction of similar object and the consequent inference from one to the other we have no notion of any necessity or connexion if it appear therefore that all mankind have ever allow without any doubt or hesitation that these two circumstances take place in the voluntary action of men and in the operations of mind it must follow that all mankind have ever agree in the doctrine of necessity and that they have hitherto dispute merely for not understand each other as to the first circumstance the constant and regular conjunction of similar events we may possibly satisfy ourselves by the follow ing considerations it be universally acknowledge that there be a great uniformity among the action of men in all nations and age and that human nature remain still the same in its principles and operations the same motives always produce the same action the same events follow from the same cause ambition avarice selflove vanity friendship generosity public spirit these passions mix in various degrees and distribute through society have be from the begin of the world and still be the source of all the action and enterprises which have ever be observe among mankind would you know the sentiments inclinations and course of life of the greeks and romans study well the temper and action of the french and english you can not be much mistake in transfer to the former most of the observations which you have make with regard to the latter mankind be so much the same in all time and place that history inform us of nothing new or strange in this particular its chief use be only to discover the constant and universal principles of human nature by show men in all varieties of circumstances and situations and furnish us with materials from which we may form our observations and become acquaint with the regular spring of human action and behaviour these record of war intrigue factions and revolutions be so many collections of experiment by which the politician or moral philosopher fix the principles of his science in the same manner as the physician or natural philosopher become acquaint with the nature of plant minerals and other external object by the experiment which he form concern them nor be the earth water and other elements examine by aristotle and hippocrates more like to those which at present lie under our observation than the men describe by polybius and tacitus be to those who now govern the world should a traveller return from a far country bring us an account of men wholly different from any with whom we be ever acquaint men who be entirely divest of avarice ambition or revenge who know no pleasure but friendship generosity and public spirit we should immediately from these circumstances detect the falsehood and prove him a liar with the same certainty as if he have stuff his narration with stories of centaurs and dragons miracles and prodigies and if we would explode any forgery in history we can not make use of a more convince argument than to prove that the action ascribe to any person be directly contrary to the course of nature and that no human motives in such circumstances could ever induce him to such a conduct the veracity of quintus curtius be as much to be suspect when he describe the supernatural courage of alexander by which he be hurry on singly to attack multitudes as when he describe his supernatural force and activity by which he be able to resist them so readily and universally do we acknowledge a uniformity in human motives and action as well as in the operations of body hence likewise the benefit of that experience acquire by long life and a variety of business and company in order to instruct us in the principles of human nature and regulate our future conduct as well as speculation by mean of this guide we mount up to the knowledge of mens inclinations and motives from their action expressions and even gesture and again descend to the interpretation of their action from our knowledge of their motives and inclinations the general observations treasure up by a course of experience give us the clue of human nature and teach us to unravel all its intricacies pretexts and appearances no longer deceive us public declarations pass for the specious colour of a cause and though virtue and honour be allow their proper weight and authority that perfect disinterestedness so often pretend to be never expect in multitudes and party seldom in their leaders and scarcely even in individuals of any rank or station but be there no uniformity in human action and be every experiment which we could form of this kind irregular and anomalous it be impossible to collect any general observations concern mankind and no experience however accurately digest by reflection would ever serve to any purpose why be the age husbandman more skilful in his call than the young beginner but because there be a certain uniformity in the operation of the sun rain and earth towards the production of vegetables and experience teach the old practitioner the rule by which this operation be govern and direct we must not however expect that this uniformity of human action should be carry to such a length as that all men in the same circumstances will always act precisely in the same manner without make any allowance for the diversity of character prejudice and opinions such a uniformity in every particular be find in no part of nature on the contrary from observe the variety of conduct in different men we be enable to form a greater variety of maxims which still suppose a degree of uniformity and regularity be the manners of men different in different age and countries we learn thence the great force of custom and education which mould the human mind from its infancy and form it into a fix and establish character be the behaviour and conduct of the one sex very unlike that of the other be it thence we become acquaint with the different character which nature have impress upon the sex and which she preserve with constancy and regularity be the action of the same person much diversify in the different periods of his life from infancy to old age this afford room for many general observations concern the gradual change of our sentiments and inclinations and the different maxims which prevail in the different age of human creatures even the character which be peculiar to each individual have a uniformity in their influence otherwise our acquaintance with the persons and our observation of their conduct could never teach us their dispositions or serve to direct our behaviour with regard to them grant it possible to find some action which seem to have no regular connexion with any know motives and be exceptions to all the measure of conduct which have ever be establish for the government of men but if we would willingly know what judgement should be form of such irregular and extraordinary action we may consider the sentiments commonly entertain with regard to those irregular events which appear in the course of nature and the operations of external object all cause be not conjoin to their usual effect with like uniformity an artificer who handle only dead matter may be disappoint of his aim as well as the politician who direct the conduct of sensible and intelligent agents the vulgar who take things accord to their first appearance attribute the uncertainty of events to such an uncertainty in the cause as make the latter often fail of their usual influence though they meet with no impediment in their operation but philosophers observe that almost in every part of nature there be contain a vast variety of spring and principles which be hide by reason of their minuteness or remoteness find that it be at least possible the contrariety of events may not proceed from any contingency in the cause but from the secret operation of contrary cause this possibility be convert into certainty by farther observation when they remark that upon an exact scrutiny a contrariety of effect always betray a contrariety of cause and proceed from their mutual opposition a peasant can give no better reason for the stop of any clock or watch than to say that it do not commonly go right but an artist easily perceive that the same force in the spring or pendulum have always the same influence on the wheel but fail of its usual effect perhaps by reason of a grain of dust which put a stop to the whole movement from the observation of several parallel instance philosophers form a maxim that the connexion between all cause and effect be equally necessary and that its seem uncertainty in some instance proceed from the secret opposition of contrary cause thus for instance in the human body when the usual symptoms of health or sickness disappoint our expectation when medicine operate not with their wonted power when irregular events follow from any particular cause the philosopher and physician be not surprise at the matter nor be ever tempt to deny in general the necessity and uniformity of those principles by which the animal economy be conduct they know that a human body be a mighty complicate machine that many secret power lurk in it which be altogether beyond our comprehension that to us it must often appear very uncertain in its operations and that therefore the irregular events which outwardly discover themselves can be no proof that the laws of nature be not observe with the greatest regularity in its internal operations and government the philosopher if he be consistent must apply the same reason to the action and volitions of intelligent agents the most irregular and unexpected resolutions of men may frequently be account for by those who know every particular circumstance of their character and situation a person of an oblige disposition give a peevish answer but he have the toothache or have not din a stupid fellow discover an uncommon alacrity in his carriage but he have meet with a sudden piece of good fortune or even when an action as sometimes happen can not be particularly account for either by the person himself or by others we know in general that the character of men be to a certain degree inconstant and irregular this be in a manner the constant character of human nature though it be applicable in a more particular manner to some persons who have no fix rule for their conduct but proceed in a continue course of caprice and inconstancy the internal principles and motives may operate in a uniform manner notwithstanding these seem irregularities in the same manner as the wind rain cloud and other variations of the weather be suppose to be govern by steady principles though not easily discoverable by human sagacity and enquiry thus it appear not only that the conjunction between motives and voluntary action be as regular and uniform as that between the cause and effect in any part of nature but also that this regular conjunc tion have be universally acknowledge among mankind and have never be the subject of dispute either in philosophy or common life now as it be from past experience that we draw all inferences concern the future and as we conclude that object will always be conjoin together which we find to have always be conjoin it may seem superfluous to prove that this experience uniformity in human action be a source whence we draw inferences concern them but in order to throw the argument into a greater variety of light we shall also insist though briefly on this latter topic the mutual dependence of men be so great in all societies that scarce any human action be entirely complete in itself or be perform without some reference to the action of others which be requisite to make it answer fully the intention of the agent the poorest artificer who labour alone expect at least the protection of the magistrate to ensure him the enjoyment of the fruit of his labour he also expect that when he carry his goods to market and offer them at a reasonable price he shall find purchasers and shall be able by the money he acquire to engage others to supply him with those commodities which be requisite for his subsistence in proportion as men extend their deal and render their intercourse with others more complicate they always comprehend in their scheme of life a greater variety of voluntary action which they expect from the proper motives to cooperate with their own in all these conclusions they take their measure from past experience in the same manner as in their reason concern external object and firmly believe that men as well as all the elements be to continue in their operations the same that they have ever find them a manufacturer reckon upon the labour of his servants for the execution of any work as much as upon the tool which he employ and would be equally surprise be his expectations disappoint in short this experimental inference and reason concern the action of others enter so much into human life that no man while awake be ever a moment without employ it have we not reason therefore to affirm that all mankind have always agree in the doctrine of necessity accord to the forego definition and explication of it nor have philosophers ever entertain a different opinion from the people in this particular for not to mention that almost every action of their life suppose that opinion there be even few of the speculative part of learn to which it be not essential what would become of history have we not a dependence on the veracity of the historian accord ing to the experience which we have have of mankind how could politics be a science if laws and form of government have not a uniform influence upon society where would be the foundation of morals if particular character have no certain or determinate power to produce particular sentiments and if these sentiments have no constant operation on action and with what pretence could we employ our criticism upon any poet or polite author if we could not pronounce the conduct and sentiments of his actors either natural or unnatural to such character and in such circumstances it seem almost impossible therefore to engage either in science or action of any kind without acknowledge the doctrine of necessity and this inference from motive to voluntary action from character to conduct and indeed when we consider how aptly natural and moral evidence link together and form only one chain of argument we shall make no scruple to allow that they be of the same nature and derive from the same principles a prisoner who have neither money nor interest discover the impossibility of his escape as well when he consider the obstinacy of the gaoler as the wall and bar with which he be surround and in all attempt for his freedom choose rather to work upon the stone and iron of the one than upon the inflexible nature of the other the same prisoner when conduct to the scaffold foresee his death as certainly from the constancy and fidelity of his guard as from the operation of the axe or wheel his mind run along a certain train of ideas the refusal of the soldier to consent to his escape the action of the executioner the separation of the head and body bleed convulsive motion and death here be a connect chain of natural cause and voluntary action but the mind feel no difference between them in pass from one link to another nor be less certain of the future event than if it be connect with the object present to the memory or sense by a train of cause cement together by what we be please to call a physical necessity the same experience union have the same effect on the mind whether the unite object be motives volition and action or figure and motion we may change the name of things but their nature and their operation on the understand never change be a man whom know to be honest and opulent and with whom live in intimate friendship to come into my house where be surround with my servants rest assure that he be not to stab me before he leave it in order to rob me of my silver standish and no more suspect this event than the fall of the house itself which be new and solidly build and found but he may have be seize with a sudden and unknown frenzy so may a sudden earthquake arise and shake and tumble my house about my ears shall therefore change the suppositions shall say that know with certainty that he be not to put his hand into the fire and hold it there till it be consume and this event think can foretell with the same assurance as that if he throw himself out at the window and meet with no obstruction he will not remain a moment suspend in the air no suspicion of an unknown frenzy can give the least possibility to the former event which be so contrary to all the know principles of human nature a man who at noon leave his purse full of gold on the pavement at char cross may as well expect that it will fly away like a feather as that he will find it untouched an hour after above one half of human reason contain inferences of a similar nature attend with more or less degrees of certainty proportion to our experience of the usual conduct of mankind in such particular situations have frequently consider what could possibly be the reason why all mankind though they have ever without hesitation acknowledge the doctrine of necessity in their whole practice and reason have yet discover such a reluctance to acknowledge it in word and have rather show a propensity in all age to profess the contrary opinion the matter think may be account for after the follow manner if we examine the operations of body and the production of effect from their cause we shall find that all our faculties can never carry us farther in our knowledge of this relation than barely to observe that particular object be constantly conjoin together and that the mind be carry by a customary transition from the appearance of one to the belief of the other but though this conclusion concern human ignorance be the result of the strictest scrutiny of this subject men still entertain a strong propensity to believe that they penetrate farther into the power of nature and perceive something like a necessary connexion between the cause and the effect when again they turn their reflections towards the operations of their own mind and feel no such connexion of the motive and the action they be thence apt to suppose that there be a difference between the effect which result from material force and those which arise from think and intelligence but be once convince that we know nothing farther of causation of any kind than merely the constant conjunction of object and the consequent inference of the mind from one to another and find that these two circumstances be universally allow to have place in voluntary action we may be more easily lead to own the same necessity common to all cause and though this reason may contradict the systems of many philosophers in ascribe necessity to the determinations of the will we shall find upon reflection that they dissent from it in word only not in their real sentiment necessity accord to the sense in which it be here take have never yet be reject nor can ever think be reject by any philosopher it may only perhaps be pretend that the mind can perceive in the operations of matter some farther connexion between the cause and effect and connexion that have not place in voluntary action of intelligent be now whether it be so or not can only appear upon examination and it be incumbent on these philosophers to make good their assertion by define or describe that necessity and point it out to us in the operations of material cause it would seem indeed that men begin at the wrong end of this question concern liberty and necessity when they enter upon it by examine the faculties of the soul the influence of the understand and the operations of the will let them first discuss a more simple question namely the operations of body and of brute unintelligent matter and try whether they can there form any idea of causation and necessity except that of a constant conjunction of object and subsequent inference of the mind from one to another if these circumstances form in reality the whole of that necessity which we conceive in matter and if these circumstances be also universally acknowledge to take place in the operations of the mind the dispute be at an end at least must be own to be thenceforth merely verbal but as long as we will rashly suppose that we have some farther idea of necessity and causation in the operations of external object at the same time that we can find nothing farther in the voluntary action of the mind there be no possibility of bring the question to any determinate issue while we proceed upon so erroneous a supposition the only method of undeceive us be to mount up higher to examine the narrow extent of science when apply to material cause and to convince ourselves that all we know of them be the constant conjunction and inference above mention we may perhaps find that it be with difficulty we be induce to fix such narrow limit to human understand but we can afterwards find no difficulty when we come to apply this doctrine to the action of the will for as it be evident that these have a regular conjunction with motives and circumstances and character and as we always draw inferences from one to the other we must be oblige to acknowledge in word that necessity which we have already avow in every deliberation of our live and in every step of our conduct and behaviour but to proceed in this reconcile project with regard to the question of liberty and necessity the most contentious question of metaphysics the most contentious science it will not require many word to prove that all mankind have ever agree in the doctrine of liberty as well as in that of necessity and that the whole dispute in this respect also have be hitherto merely verbal for what be mean by liberty when apply to voluntary action we can not surely mean that action have so little connexion with motives inclinations and circumstances that one do not follow with a certain degree of uniformity from the other and that one afford no inference by which we can conclude the existence of the other for these be plain and acknowledge matter of fact by liberty then we can only mean a power of act or not act accord to the determinations of the will that be if we choose to remain at rest we may if we choose to move we also may now this hypothetical liberty be universally allow to belong to every one who be not a prisoner and in chain here then be no subject of dispute whatever definition we may give of liberty we should be careful to observe two requisite circumstances first that it be consistent with plain matter of fact secondly that it be consistent with itself if we observe these circumstances and render our definition intelligible be persuade that all mankind will be find of one opinion with regard to it it be universally allow that nothing exist without a cause of its existence and that chance when strictly examine be a mere negative word and mean not any real power which have anywhere a be in nature but it be pretend that some cause be necessary some not necessary here then be the advantage of definitions let any one define a cause without comprehend as a part of the definition a necessary connexion with its effect and let him show distinctly the origin of the idea express by the definition and shall readily give up the whole controversy but if the forego explication of the matter be receive this must be absolutely impracticable have not object a regular conjunction with each other we should never have entertain any notion of cause and effect and this regular conjunction produce that inference of the understand which be the only connexion that we can have any comprehension of whoever attempt a definition of cause exclusive of these circumstances will be oblige either to employ unintelligible term or such as be synonymous to the term which he endeavour to define and if the definition above mention be admit liberty when oppose to necessity not to constraint be the same thing with chance which be universally allow to have no existence part there be no method of reason more common and yet none more blameable than in philosophical dispute to endeavour the refutation of any hypothesis by a pretence of its dangerous consequences to religion and morality when any opinion lead to absurdities it be certainly false but it be not certain that an opinion be false because it be of dangerous consequence such topics therefore ought entirely to be forbear as serve nothing to the discovery of truth but only to make the person of an antagonist odious this observe in general without pretend to draw any advantage from it frankly submit to an examination of this kind and shall venture to affirm that the doctrines both of necessity and of liberty as above explain be not only consistent with morality but be absolutely essential to its support necessity may be define two ways conformably to the two definitions of cause of which it make an essential part it consist either in the constant conjunction of like object or in the inference of the understand from one object to another now necessity in both these sense which indeed be at bottom the same have universally though tacitly in the school in the pulpit and in common life be allow to belong to the will of man and no one have ever pretend to deny that we can draw inferences concern human action and that those inferences be found on the experience union of like action with like motives inclinations and circumstances the only particular in which any one can differ be that either perhaps he will refuse to give the name of necessity to this property of human action but as long as the mean be understand hope the word can do no harm or that he will maintain it possible to discover something farther in the operations of matter but this it must be acknowledge can be of no consequence to morality or religion whatever it may be to natural philosophy or metaphysics we may here be mistake in assert that there be no idea of any other necessity or connexion in the action of body but surely we ascribe nothing to the action of the mind but what everyone do and must readily allow of we change no circumstance in the receive orthodox system with regard to the will but only in that with regard to material object and cause nothing therefore can be more innocent at least than this doctrine all laws be found on reward and punishments it be suppose as a fundamental principle that these motives have a regular and uniform influence on the mind and both produce the good and prevent the evil action we may give to this influence what name we please but as it be usually conjoin with the action it must be esteem a cause and be look upon as an instance of that necessity which we would here establish the only proper object of hatred or vengeance be a person or creature endow with think and consciousness and when any criminal or injurious action excite that passion it be only by their relation to the person or connexion with him action be by their very nature temporary and perish and where they proceed not from some cause in the character and disposition of the person who perform them they can neither redound to his honour if good nor infamy if evil the action themselves may be blameable they may be contrary to all the rule of morality and religion but the person be not answerable for them and as they proceed from nothing in him that be durable and constant and leave nothing of that nature behind them it be impossible he can upon their account become the object of punishment or vengeance accord to the principle therefore which deny necessity and consequently cause a man be as pure and untainted after have commit the most horrid crime as at the first moment of his birth nor be his character anywise concern in his action since they be not derive from it and the wickedness of the one can never be use as a proof of the depravity of the other men be not blame for such action as they perform ignorantly and casually whatever may be the consequences why but because the principles of these action be only momentary and terminate in them alone men be less blame for such action as they perform hastily and unpremeditately than for such as proceed from deliberation for what reason but because a hasty temper though a constant cause or principle in the mind operate only by intervals and infect not the whole character again repentance wipe off every crime if attend with a reformation of life and manners how be this to be account for but by assert that action render a person criminal merely as they be proof of criminal principles in the mind and when by an alteration of these principles they cease to be just proof they likewise cease to be criminal but except upon the doctrine of necessity they never be just proof and consequently never be criminal it will be equally easy to prove and from the same arguments that liberty accord to that definition above mention in which all men agree be also essential to morality and that no human action where it be want be susceptible of any moral qualities or can be the object either of approbation or dislike for as action be object of our moral sentiment so far only as they be indications of the internal character passions and affections it be impossible that they can give rise either to praise or blame where they proceed not from these principles but be derive altogether from external violence pretend not to have obviate or remove all objections to this theory with regard to necessity and liberty can foresee other objections derive from topics which have not here be treat of it may be say for instance that if voluntary action be subject to the same laws of necessity with the operations of matter there be a continue chain of necessary cause preordain and predetermine reach from the original cause of all to every single volition of every human creature no contingency anywhere in the universe no indifference no liberty while we act we be at the same time act upon the ultimate author of all our volitions be the creator of the world who first bestow motion on this immense machine and place all be in that particular position whence every subsequent event by an inevitable necessity must result human action therefore either can have no moral turpitude at all as proceed from so good a cause or if they have any turpitude they must involve our creator in the same guilt while he be acknowledge to be their ultimate cause and author for as a man who fire a mine be answerable for all the consequences whether the train he employ be long or short so wherever a continue chain of necessary cause be fix that be either finite or infinite who produce the first be likewise the author of all the rest and must both bear the blame and acquire the praise which belong to them our clear and unalterable ideas of morality establish this rule upon unquestionable reason when we examine the consequences of any human action and these reason must still have greater force when apply to the volitions and intentions of a be infinitely wise and powerful ignorance or importence may be plead for so limit a creature as man but those imperfections have no place in our creator he foresee he ordain he intend all those action of men which we so rashly pronounce criminal and we must therefore conclude either that they be not criminal or that the deity not man be accountable for them but as either of these position be absurd and impious it follow that the doctrine from which they be deduce can not possibly be true as be liable to all the same objections an absurd consequence if necessary prove the original doctrine to be absurd in the same manner as criminal action render criminal the original cause if the connexion between them be necessary and evitable this objection consist of two part which we shall examine separately first that if human action can be trace up by a necessary chain to the deity they can never be criminal on account of the infinite perfection of that be from whom they be derive and who can intend nothing but what be altogether good and laudable or secondly if they be criminal we must retract the attribute of perfection which we ascribe to the deity and must acknowledge him to be the ultimate author of guilt and moral turpitude in all his creatures the answer to the first objection seem obvious and convince there be many philosophers who after an exact scrutiny of all the phenomena of nature conclude that the whole consider as one system be in every period of its existence order with perfect benevolence and that the utmost possible happiness will in the end result to all create be without any mixture of positive or absolute ill or misery every physical ill say they make an essential part of this benevolent system and could not possibly be remove even by the deity himself consider as a wise agent without give entrance to greater ill or exclude greater good which will result from it from this theory some philosophers and the ancient stoics among the rest derive a topic of consolation under all afflictions while they teach their pupils that those ills under which they labour be in reality goods to the universe and that to an enlarge view which could comprehend the whole system of nature every event become an object of joy and exultation but though this topic be specious and sublime it be soon find in practice weak and ineffectual you would surely more irritate than appease a man lie under the rack pain of the gout by preach up to him the rectitude of those general laws which produce the malignant humour in his body and lead them through the proper canal to the sinews and nerve where they now excite such acute torment these enlarge view may for a moment please the imagination of a speculative man who be place in ease and security but neither can they dwell with constancy on his mind even though undisturbed by the emotions of pain or passion much less can they maintain their grind when attack by such powerful antagonists the affections take a narrower and more natural survey of their object and by an economy more suitable to the infirmity of human mind regard alone the be around us and be actuate by such events as appear good or ill to the private system the case be the same with moral as with physical ill it can not reasonably be suppose that those remote considerations which be find of so little efficacy with regard to one will have a more powerful influence with regard to the other the mind of man be so form by nature that upon the appearance of certain character dispositions and action it immediately feel the sentiment of approbation or blame nor be there any emotions more essential to its frame and constitution the character which engage our approbation be chiefly such as contribute to the peace and security of human society as the character which excite blame be chiefly such as tend to public detriment and disturbance whence it may reasonably be presume that the moral sentiments arise either mediately or immediately from a reflection of these opposite interest what though philosophical meditations establish a different opinion or conjecture that everything be right with regard to the whole and that the qualities which disturb society be in the main as beneficial and be as suitable to the primary intention of nature as those which more directly promote its happiness and welfare be such remote and uncertain speculations able to counterbalance the sentiments which arise from the natural and immediate view of the object a man who be rob of a considerable sum do he find his vexation for the loss anywise diminish by these sublime reflections why then should his moral resentment against the crime be suppose incompatible with them or why should not the acknowledgement of a real distinction between vice and virtue be reconcileable to all speculative systems of philosophy as well as that of a real distinction between personal beauty and deformity both these distinctions be found in the natural sentiments of the human mind and these sentiments be not to be controuled or alter by any philosophical theory or speculation whatsoever the second objection admit not of so easy and satisfactory an answer nor be it possible to explain distinctly how the deity can be the mediate cause of all the action of men without be the author of sin and moral turpitude these be mysteries which mere natural and unas sisted reason be very unfit to handle and whatever system she embrace she must find herself involve in inextricable difficulties and even contradictions at every step which she take with regard to such subject to reconcile the indifference and contingency of human action with prescience or to defend absolute decree and yet free the deity from be the author of sin have be find hitherto to exceed all the power of philosophy happy if she be thence sensible of her temerity when she pry into these sublime mysteries and leave a scene so full of obscurities and perplexities return with suitable modesty to her true and proper province the examination of common life where she will find difficulties enough to employ her enquiries without launch into so boundless an ocean of doubt uncertainty and contradiction sect of the reason of animals all our reason concern matter of fact be found on a species of analogy which lead us to expect from any cause the same events which we have observe to result from similar cause where the cause be entirely similar the analogy be perfect and the inference draw from it be regard as certain and conclusive nor do any man ever entertain a doubt where he see a piece of iron that it will have weight and cohesion of part as in all other instance which have ever fall under his observation but where the object have not so exact a similarity the analogy be less perfect and the inference be less conclusive though still it have some force in proportion to the degree of similarity and resemblance the anatomical observations form upon one animal be by this species of reason extend to all animals and it be certain that when the circulation of the blood for instance be clearly prove to have place in one creature as a frog or fish it form a strong presumption that the same principle have place in all these analogical observations may be carry farther even to this science of which we be now treat and any theory by which we explain the operations of the understand or the origin and connexion of the passions in man will acquire additional authority if we find that the same theory be requisite to explain the same phenomena in all other animals we shall make trial of this with regard to the hypothesis by which we have in the forego discourse endeavour to account for all experimental reason and it be hop that this new point of view will serve to confirm all our former observations first it seem evident that animals as well as men learn many things from experience and infer that the same events will always follow from the same cause by this principle they become acquaint with the more obvious properties of external object and gradually from their birth treasure up a knowledge of the nature of fire water earth stone heights depths c and of the effect which result from their operation the ignorance and inexperience of the young be here plainly distinguishable from the cunning and sagacity of the old who have learn by long observation to avoid what hurt them and to pursue what give ease or pleasure a horse that have be accustom to the field become acquaint with the proper height which he can leap and will never attempt what exceed his force and ability an old greyhound will trust the more fatigue part of the chace to the younger and will place himself so as to meet the hare in her double nor be the conjecture which he form on this occasion found in any thing but his observation and experience this be still more evident from the effect of discipline and education on animals who by the proper application of reward and punishments may be teach any course of action and most contrary to their natural instincts and propensities be it not experience which render a dog apprehensive of pain when you menace him or lift up the whip to beat him be be not even experience which make him answer to his name and infer from such an arbitrary sound that you mean him rather than any of his fellows and intend to call him when you pronounce it in a certain manner and with a certain tone and accent in all these case we may observe that the animal infer some fact beyond what immediately strike his sense and that this inference be altogether found on past experience while the creature expect from the present object the same consequences which it have always find in its observation to result from similar object secondly it be impossible that this inference of the animal can be found on any process of argument or reason by which he conclude that like events must follow like object and that the course of nature will always be regular in its operations for if there be in reality any arguments of this nature they surely lie too abstruse for the observation of such imperfect understand since it may well employ the utmost care and attention of a philosophic genius to discover and observe them animals therefore be not guide in these inferences by reason neither be children neither be the generality of mankind in their ordinary action and conclusions neither be philosophers them selves who in all the active part of life be in the main the same with the vulgar and be govern by the same maxims nature must have provide some other principle of more ready and more general use and application nor can an operation of such immense consequence in life as that of infer effect from cause be trust to the uncertain process of reason and argumentation be this doubtful with regard to men it seem to admit of no question with regard to the brute creation and the conclusion be once firmly establish in the one we have a strong presumption from all the rule of analogy that it ought to be universally admit without any exception or reserve it be custom alone which engage animals from every object that strike their sense to infer its usual attendant and carry their imagination from the appearance of the one to conceive the other in that particular manner which we denominate belief no other explication can be give of this operation in all the higher as well as lower class of sensitive be which fall under our notice and observation we shall here endeavour briefly to explain the great difference in human understand after which the reason of the difference between men and animals will easily be comprehend when we have live any time and have be accustom to the uniformity of nature we acquire a general habit by which we always transfer the know to the unknown and conceive the latter to resemble the former by mean of this general habitual principle we regard even one experiment as the foundation of reason and expect a similar event with some degree of certainty where the experiment have be make accurately and free from all foreign circumstances it be therefore consider as a matter of great importance to observe the consequences of things and as one man may very much surpass another in attention and memory and observation this will make a very great difference in their reason where there be a complication of cause to produce any effect one mind may be much larger than another and better able to comprehend the whole system of object and to infer justly their consequences one man be able to carry on a chain of consequences to a greater length than another few men can think long without run into a confusion of ideas and mistake one for another and there be various degrees of this infirmity the circumstance on which the effect depend be frequently in volved in other circumstances which be foreign and extrinsic the separation of it often require great attention accuracy and subtilty the form of general maxims from particular observation be a very nice operation and nothing be more usual from haste or a narrowness of mind which see not on all side than to commit mistake in this particular when we reason from analogies the man who have the greater experience or the greater promptitude of suggest analogies will be the better reasoner byasses from prejudice education passion party c hang more upon one mind than another after we have acquire a confidence in human testimony book and conversation enlarge much more the sphere of one man experience and think than those of another it would be easy to discover many other circumstances that make a difference in the understand of men but though animals learn many part of their knowledge from observation there be also many part of it which they derive from the original hand of nature which much exceed the share of capacity they possess on ordinary occasion and in which they improve little or nothing by the longest practice and experience these we denominate instincts and be so apt to admire as something very extraordinary and inexplicable by all the disquisitions of human understand but our wonder will perhaps cease or diminish when we consider that the experimental reason itself which we possess in common with beasts and on which the whole conduct of life depend be nothing but a species of instinct or mechanical power that act in us unknown to ourselves and in its chief operations be not direct by any such relations or comparisons of ideas as be the proper object of our intellectual faculties though the instinct be different yet still it be an instinct which teach a man to avoid the fire as much as that which teach a bird with such exactness the art of incubation and the whole economy and order of its nursery sect of miracles part there be in dr tillotsons write an argument against the real presence which be as concise and elegant and strong as any argument can possibly be suppose against a doctrine so little worthy of a serious refutation it be acknowledge on all hand say that learn prelate that the authority either of the scripture or of tradition be found merely in the testimony of the apostles who be eyewitness to those miracles of our saviour by which he prove his divine mission our evidence then for the truth of the christian religion be less than the evidence for the truth of our sense because even in the first author of our religion it be no greater and it be evident it must diminish in pass from them to their disciples nor can any one rest such confidence in their testimony as in the immediate object of his sense but a weaker evidence can never destroy a stronger and therefore be the doctrine of the real presence ever so clearly reveal in scripture it be directly contrary to the rule of just reason to give our assent to it it contradict sense though both the scripture and tradition on which it be suppose to be build carry not such evidence with them as sense when they be consider merely as external evidence and be not bring home to every ones breast by the immediate operation of the holy spirit nothing be so convenient as a decisive argument of this kind which must at least silence the most arrogant bigotry and superstition and free us from their impertinent solicitations flatter myself that have discover an argument of a like nature which if just will with the wise and learn be an everlasting check to all kinds of superstitious delusion and consequently will be useful as long as the world endure for so long presume will the account of miracles and prodigies be find in all history sacred and profane though experience be our only guide in reason concern matter of fact it must be acknowledge that this guide be not altogether infallible but in some case be apt to lead us into errors one who in our climate should expect better weather in any week of june than in one of december would reason justly and conformably to experience but it be certain that he may happen in the event to find himself mistake however we may observe that in such a case he would have no cause to complain of experience because it commonly inform us beforehand of the uncertainty by that contrariety of events which we may learn from a diligent observation all effect follow not with like certainty from their suppose cause some events be find in all countries and all age to have be constantly conjoin together others be find to have be more variable and sometimes to disappoint our expectations so that in our reason concern matter of fact there be all imaginable degrees of assurance from the highest certainty to the lowest species of moral evidence a wise man therefore proportion his belief to the evidence in such conclusions as be found on an infallible experience he expect the event with the last degree of assurance and regard his past experience as a full proof of the future existence of that event in other case he proceed with more caution he weigh the opposite experiment he consider which side be support by the greater number of experiment to that side he incline with doubt and hesitation and when at last he fix his judgement the evidence exceed not what we properly call probability all probability then suppose an opposition of experiment and observations where the one side be find to overbalance the other and to produce a degree of evidence proportion to the superiority a hundred instance or experiment on one side and fifty on another afford a doubtful expectation of any event though a hundred uniform experiment with only one that be contradictory reasonably beget a pretty strong degree of assurance in all case we must balance the opposite experiment where they be opposite and deduct the smaller number from the greater in order to know the exact force of the superior evidence to apply these principles to a particular instance we may observe that there be no species of reason more common more useful and even necessary to human life than that which be derive from the testimony of men and the report of eyewitness and spectators this species of reason perhaps one may deny to be found on the relation of cause and effect shall not dispute about a word it will be sufficient to observe that our assurance in any argument of this kind be derive from no other principle than our observation of the veracity of human testimony and of the usual conformity of facts to the report of witness it be a general maxim that no object have any discoverable connexion together and that all the inferences which we can draw from one to another be found merely on our experience of their constant and regular conjunction it be evident that we ought not to make an exception to this maxim in favour of human testimony whose connexion with any event seem in itself as little necessary as any other be not the memory tenacious to a certain degree have not men commonly an inclination to truth and a principle of probity be they not sensible to shame when detect in a falsehood be not these say discover by experience to be qualities inherent in human nature we should never repose the least confidence in human testimony a man delirious or note for falsehood and villany have no manner of authority with us and as the evidence derive from witness and human testimony be found on past experience so it vary with the experience and be regard either as a proof or a probability accord as the conjunction between any particular kind of report and any kind of object have be find to be constant or variable there be a number of circumstances to be take into consideration in all judgements of this kind and the ultimate standard by which we determine all dispute that may arise concern them be always derive from experience and observation where this experience be not entirely uniform on any side it be attend with an unavoidable contrariety in our judgements and with the same opposition and mutual destruction of argument as in every other kind of evidence we frequently hesitate concern the report of others we balance the opposite circumstances which cause any doubt or uncertainty and when we discover a superiority on any side we incline to it but still with a diminution of assurance in proportion to the force of its antagonist this contrariety of evidence in the present case may be derive from several different cause from the opposition of contrary testimony from the character or number of the witness from the manner of their deliver their testimony or from the union of all these circumstances we entertain a suspicion concern any matter of fact when the witness contradict each other when they be but few or of a doubtful character when they have an interest in what they affirm when they deliver their testimony with hesitation or on the contrary with too violent asseverations there be many other particulars of the same kind which may diminish or destroy the force of any argument derive from human testimony suppose for instance that the fact which the testimony endeavour to establish partake of the extraordinary and the marvellous in that case the evidence result from the testimony admit of a diminution greater or less in proportion as the fact be more or less unusual the reason why we place any credit in witness and historians be not derive from any connexion which we perceive a priori between testimony and reality but because we be accustom to find a conformity between them but when the fact attest be such a one as have seldom fall under our observation here be a contest of two opposite experience of which the one destroy the other as far as its force go and the superior can only operate on the mind by the force which remain the very same principle of experience which give us a certain degree of assurance in the testimony of witness give us also in this case another degree of assurance against the fact which they endeavour to establish from which contradiction there necessarily arise a counterpoize and mutual destruction of belief and authority should not believe such a story be it tell me by cato be a proverbial say in rome even during the lifetime of that philosophical patriot the incredibility of a fact it be allow might invalidate so great an authority the indian prince who refuse to believe the first relations concern the effect of frost reason justly and it naturally require very strong testimony to engage his assent to facts that arise from a state of nature with which he be unacquainted and which bore so little analogy to those events of which he have have constant and uniform experience though they be not contrary to his experience they be not conformable to it but in order to encrease the probability against the testimony of witness let us suppose that the fact which they affirm instead of be only marvellous be really miraculous and suppose also that the testimony consider apart and in itself amount to an entire proof in that case there be proof against proof of which the strongest must prevail but still with a diminution of its force in proportion to that of its antagonist a miracle be a violation of the laws of nature and as a firm and unalterable experience have establish these laws the proof against a miracle from the very nature of the fact be as entire as any argument from experience can possibly be imagine why be it more than probable that all men must die that lead can not of itself remain suspend in the air that fire consume wood and be extinguish by water unless it be that these events be find agreeable to the laws of nature and there be require a violation of these laws or in other word a miracle to prevent them nothing be esteem a miracle if it ever happen in the common course of nature it be no miracle that a man seemingly in good health should die on a sudden because such a kind of death though more unusual than any other have yet be frequently observe to happen but it be a miracle that a dead man should come to life because that have never be observe in any age or country there must therefore be a uniform experience against every miraculous event otherwise the event would not merit that appellation and as a uniform experience amount to a proof there be here a direct and full proof from the nature of the fact against the existence of any miracle nor can such a proof be destroy or the miracle render credible but by an opposite proof which be superior the plain consequence be and it be a general maxim worthy of our attention that no testimony be sufficient to establish a miracle unless the testimony be of such a kind that its falsehood would be more miraculous than the fact which it endeavour to establish and even in that case there be a mutual destruction of arguments and the superior only give us an assurance suitable to that degree of force which remain after deduct the inferior when anyone tell me that he saw a dead man restore to life immediately consider with myself whether it be more probable that this person should either deceive or be deceive or that the fact which he relate should really have happen weigh the one miracle against the other and accord to the superiority which discover pronounce my decision and always reject the greater miracle if the falsehood of his testimony would be more miraculous than the event which he relate then and not till then can he pretend to command my belief or opinion part in the forego reason we have suppose that the testimony upon which a miracle be found may possibly amount to an entire proof and that the falsehood of that testimony would be a real prodigy but it be easy to shew that we have be a great deal too liberal in our concession and that there never be a miraculous event establish on so full an evidence for first there be not to be find in all history any miracle attest by a sufficient number of men of such unquestioned goodsense education and learn as to secure us against all delusion in themselves of such undoubted integrity as to place them beyond all suspicion of any design to deceive others of such credit and reputation in the eye of mankind as to have a great deal to lose in case of their be detect in any falsehood and at the same time attest facts perform in such a public manner and in so celebrate a part of the world as to render the detection unavoidable all which circumstances be requisite to give us a full assurance in the testimony of men secondly we may observe in human nature a principle which if strictly examine will be find to diminish extremely the assurance which we might from human testimony have in any kind of prodigy the maxim by which we commonly conduct ourselves in our reason be that the object of which we have no experience resemble those of which we have that what we have find to be most usual be always most probable and that where there be an opposition of arguments we ought to give the preference to such as be found on the greatest number of past observations but though in proceed by this rule we readily reject any fact which be unusual and incredible in an ordinary degree yet in advance farther the mind observe not always the same rule but when anything be affirm utterly absurd and miraculous it rather the more readily admit of such a fact upon account of that very circumstance which ought to destroy all its authority the passion of surprise and wonder arise from miracles be an agreeable emotion give a sensible tendency towards the belief of those events from which it be derive and this go so far that even those who can not enjoy this pleasure immediately nor can believe those miraculous events of which they be inform yet love to partake of the satisfaction at secondhand or by rebound and place a pride and delight in excite the admiration of others with what greediness be the miraculous account of travellers receive their descriptions of sea and land monsters their relations of wonderful adventure strange men and uncouth manners but if the spirit of religion join itself to the love of wonder there be an end of common sense and human testimony in these circumstances lose all pretensions to authority a religionist may be an enthusiast and imagine he see what have no reality he may know his narrative to be false and yet persevere in it with the best intentions in the world for the sake of promote so holy a cause or even where this delusion have not place vanity excite by so strong a temptation operate on him more powerfully than on the rest of mankind in any other circumstances and selfinterest with equal force his auditors may not have and commonly have not sufficient judgement to canvas his evidence what judgement they have they renounce by principle in these sublime and mysterious subject or if they be ever so will to employ it passion and a heat imagination disturb the regularity of its operations their credulity increase his impudence and his impudence overpower their credulity eloquence when at its highest pitch leave little room for reason or reflection but address itself entirely to the fancy or the affections captivate the will hearers and subdue their understand happily this pitch it seldom attain but what a tully or a demosthenes could scarcely effect over a roman or athenian audience every capuchin every itinerant or stationary teacher can perform over the generality of mankind and in a higher degree by touch such gross and vulgar passions the many instance of forge miracles and prophecies and supernatural events which in all age have either be detect by contrary evidence or which detect themselves by their absurdity prove sufficiently the strong propensity of mankind to the extraordinary and the marvellous and ought reasonably to beget a suspicion against all relations of this kind this be our natural way of think even with regard to the most common and most credible events for instance there be no kind of report which rise so easily and spread so quickly especially in country place and provincial towns as those concern marriages insomuch that two young persons of equal condition never see each other twice but the whole neighbourhood immediately join them together the pleasure of tell a piece of news so interest of propagate it and of be the first reporters of it spread the intelligence and this be so well know that no man of sense give attention to these report till he find them confirm by some greater evidence do not the same passions and others still stronger incline the generality of mankind to believe and report with the greatest vehemence and assurance all religious miracles thirdly it form a strong presumption against all supernatural and miraculous relations that they be observe chiefly to abound among ignorant and barbarous nations or if a civilize people have ever give admission to any of them that people will be find to have receive them from ignorant and barbarous ancestors who transmit them with that inviolable sanction and authority which always attend receive opinions when we peruse the first histories of all nations we be apt to imagine ourselves transport into some new world where the whole frame of nature be disjoint and every element perform its operations in a different manner from what it do at present battle revolutions pestilence famine and death be never the effect of those natural cause which we experience prodigies omen oracles judgements quite obscure the few natural events that be intermingle with them but as the former grow thinner every page in proportion as we advance nearer the enlighten age we soon learn that there be nothing mysterious or su pernatural in the case but that all proceed from the usual propensity of mankind towards the marvellous and that though this inclination may at intervals receive a check from sense and learn it can never be thoroughly extirpate from human nature it be strange a judicious reader be apt to say upon the perusal of these wonderful historians that such prodigious events never happen in our days but it be nothing strange hope that men should lie in all age you must surely have see instance enough of that frailty you have yourself hear many such marvellous relations start which be treat with scorn by all the wise and judicious have at last be abandon even by the vulgar be assure that those renowned lie which have spread and flourish to such a monstrous height arise from like beginnings but be sow in a more proper soil shoot up at last into prodigies almost equal to those which they relate it be a wise policy in that false prophet alexander who though now forget be once so famous to lay the first scene of his impostures in paphlagonia where as lucian tell us the people be extremely ignorant and stupid and ready to swallow even the grossest delusion people at a distance who be weak enough to think the matter at all worth enquiry have no opportunity of receive better information the stories come magnify to them by a hundred circumstances fool be industrious in propagate the imposture while the wise and learn be content in general to deride its absurdity without inform themselves of the particular facts by which it may be distinctly refute and thus the impostor above mention be enable to proceed from his ignorant paphlagonians to the enlist of votaries even among the grecian philosophers and men of the most eminent rank and distinction in rome nay could engage the attention of that sage emperor marcus aurelius so far as to make him trust the success of a military expedition to his delusive prophecies the advantage be so great of start an imposture among an ignorant people that even though the delusion should be too gross to impose on the generality of them which though seldom be sometimes the case it have a much better chance for succeed in remote countries than if the first scene have be lay in a city renowned for arts and knowledge the most ignorant and barbarous of these barbarians carry the report abroad none of their countrymen have a large correspondence or sufficient credit and authority to contradict and beat down the delusion mens inclination to the marvellous have full opportunity to display itself and thus a story which be universally explode in the place where it be first start shall pass for certain at a thousand miles distance but have alexander fix his residence at athens the philosophers of that renowned mart of learn have immediately spread throughout the whole roman empire their sense of the matter which be support by so great authority and display by all the force of reason and eloquence have entirely open the eye of mankind it be true lucian pass by chance through paphlagonia have an opportunity of perform this good office but though much to be wish it do not always happen that every alexander meet with a lucian ready to expose and detect his impostures may add as a fourth reason which diminish the authority of prodigies that there be no testimony for any even those which have not be expressly detect that be not oppose by an infinite number of witness so that not only the miracle destroy the credit of testimony but the testimony destroy itself to make this the better understand let us consider that in matter of religion whatever be different be contrary and that it be impossible the religions of ancient rome of turkey of siam and of china should all of them be establish on any solid foundation every miracle therefore pretend to have be work in any of these religions and all of them abound in miracles as its direct scope be to establish the particular system to which it be attribute so have it the same force though more indirectly to overthrow every other system in destroy a rival system it likewise destroy the credit of those miracles on which that system be establish so that all the prodigies of different religions be to be regard as contrary facts and the evidence of these prodigies whether weak or strong as opposite to each other accord to this method of reason when we believe any miracle of mahomet or his successors we have for our warrant the testimony of a few barbarous arabians and on the other hand we be to regard the authority of titus livius plutarch tacitus and in short of all the author and witness grecian chinese and roman catholic who have relate any miracle in their particular religion say we be to regard their testimony in the same light as if they have mention that mahometan miracle and have in express term contradict it with the same certainty as they have for the miracle they relate this argument may appear over subtile and refine but be not in reality different from the reason of a judge who suppose that the credit of two witness maintain a crime against any one be destroy by the testi mony of two others who affirm him to have be two hundred league distant at the same instant when the crime be say to have be commit one of the best attest miracles in all profane history be that which tacitus report of vespasian who cure a blind man in alexandria by mean of his spittle and a lame man by the mere touch of his foot in obedience to a vision of the god serapis who have enjoin them to have recourse to the emperor for these miraculous cure the story may be see in that fine historian where every circumstance seem to add weight to the testimony and might be display at large with all the force of argument and eloquence if any one be now concern to enforce the evidence of that explode and idolatrous superstition the gravity solidity age and probity of so great an emperor who through the whole course of his life converse in a familiar manner with his friends and courtiers and never affect those extraordinary air of divinity assume by alexander and demetrius the historian a contemporary writer note for candour and veracity and withal the greatest and most penetrate genius perhaps of all antiquity and so free from any tendency to credulity that he even lie under the contrary imputation of atheism and profaneness the persons from whose authority he relate the miracle of establish character for judgement and veracity as we may well presume eyewitness of the fact and confirm their testimony after the flavian family be despoil of the empire and could no longer give any reward as the price of a lie utrumque qui interfuere nunc quoque memorant postquam nullum mendacio pretium to which if we add the public nature of the facts as relate it will appear that no evidence can well be suppose stronger for so gross and so palpable a falsehood there be also a memorable story relate by cardinal de retz which may well deserve our consideration when that intrigue politician flee into spain to avoid the persecution of his enemies he pass through saragossa the capital of aragon where he be shew in the cathedral a man who have serve seven years as a doorkeeper and be well know to every body in town that have ever pay his devotions at that church he have be see for so long a time want a leg but recover that limb by the rub of holy oil upon the stump and the cardinal assure us that he saw him with two legs this miracle be vouch by all the canons of the church and the whole company in town be appeal to for a confirmation of the fact whom the cardinal find by their zealous devotion to be thorough believers of the miracle here the relater be also contemporary to the suppose prodigy of an incredulous and libertine character as well as of great genius the miracle of so singular a nature as could scarcely admit of a counterfeit and the witness very numerous and all of them in a manner spectators of the fact to which they give their testimony and what add mightily to the force of the evidence and may double our surprise on this occasion be that the cardinal himself who relate the story seem not to give any credit to it and consequently can not be suspect of any concurrence in the holy fraud he consider justly that it be not requisite in order to reject a fact of this nature to be able accurately to disprove the testimony and to trace its falsehood through all the circumstances of knavery and credulity which produce it he know that as this be commonly altogether impossible at any small distance of time and place so be it extremely difficult even where one be immediately present by reason of the bigotry ignorance cunning and roguery of a great part of mankind he therefore conclude like a just reasoner that such an evidence carry falsehood upon the very face of it and that a miracle support by any human testimony be more properly a subject of derision than of argument there surely never be a greater number of miracles ascribe to one person than those which be lately say to have be work in france upon the tomb of abbe paris the famous jansenist with whose sanctity the people be so long delude the cure of the sick give hear to the deaf and sight to the blind be every where talk of as the usual effect of that holy sepulchre but what be more extraordinary many of the miracles be immediately prove upon the spot before judge of unquestioned integrity attest by witness of credit and distinction in a learn age and on the most eminent theatre that be now in the world nor be this all a relation of them be publish and disperse every where nor be the jesuits though a learn body support by the civil magistrate and determine enemies to those opinions in whose favour the miracles be say to have be work ever able distinctly to refute or detect them where shall we find such a number of circumstances agree to the corroboration of one fact and what have we to oppose to such a cloud of witness but the absolute impossibility or miraculous nature of the events which they relate and this surely in the eye of all reasonable people will alone be regard as a sufficient refutation be the consequence just because some human testimony have the utmost force and authority in some case when it relate the battle of philippi or pharsalia for instance that therefore all kinds of testimony must in all case have equal force and authority suppose that the caesarean and pompeian factions have each of them claim the victory in these battle and that the historians of each party have uniformly ascribe the advantage to their own side how could mankind at this distance have be able to determine between them the contrariety be equally strong between the miracles relate by herodotus or plutarch and those deliver by mariana bede or any monkish historian the wise lend a very academic faith to every report which favour the passion of the reporter whether it magnify his country his family or himself or in any other way strike in with his natural inclinations and propensities but what greater temptation than to appear a missionary a prophet an ambassador from heaven who would not encounter many dangers and difficulties in order to attain so sublime a character or if by the help of vanity and a heat imagination a man have first make a convert of himself and enter seriously into the delusion who ever scruple to make use of pious frauds in support of so holy and meritorious a cause the smallest spark may here kindle into the greatest flame because the materials be always prepare for it the avidum genus auricularum the gaze populace receive greedily without examination whatever sooths superstition and promote wonder how many stories of this nature have in all age be detect and explode in their infancy how many more have be celebrate for a time and have afterwards sink into neglect and oblivion where such report therefore fly about the solution of the phenomenon be obvious and we in conformity to regular experience and observation when we account for it by the know and natural principles of credulity and delusion and shall we rather than have a recourse to so natural a solution allow of a miraculous violation of the most establish laws of nature need not mention the difficulty of detect a falsehood in any private or even public history at the place where it be say to happen much more when the scene be remove to ever so small a distance even a court of judicature with all the authority accuracy and judgement which they can employ find themselves often at a loss to distinguish between truth and falsehood in the most recent action but the matter never come to any issue if trust to the common method of alterca tions and debate and fly rumour especially when mens passions have take part on either side in the infancy of new religions the wise and learn commonly esteem the matter too inconsiderable to deserve their attention or regard and when afterwards they would willingly detect the cheat in order to undeceive the delude multitude the season be now past and the record and witness which might clear up the matter have perish beyond recovery no mean of detection remain but those which must be draw from the very testimony itself of the reporters and these though always sufficient with the judicious and know be commonly too fine to fall under the comprehension of the vulgar upon the whole then it appear that no testimony for any kind of miracle have ever amount to a probability much less to a proof and that even suppose it amount to a proof it would be oppose by another proof derive from the very nature of the fact which it would endeavour to establish it be experience only which give authority to human testimony and it be the same experience which assure us of the laws of nature when therefore these two kinds of experience be contrary we have nothing to do but substract the one from the other and embrace an opinion either on one side or the other with that assurance which arise from the remainder but accord to the principle here explain this substraction with regard to all popular religions amount to an entire annihilation and therefore we may establish it as a maxim that no human testimony can have such force as to prove a miracle and make it a just foundation for any such system of religion beg the limitations here make may be remark when say that a miracle can never be prove so as to be the foundation of a system of religion for own that otherwise there may possibly be miracles or violations of the usual course of nature of such a kind as to admit of proof from human testimony though perhaps it will be impossible to find any such in all the record of history thus suppose all author in all languages agree that from the first of january there be a total darkness over the whole earth for eight days suppose that the tradition of this extraordinary event be still strong and lively among the people that all travellers who return from foreign countries bring us account of the same tradition without the least variation or contradiction it be evident that our present philosophers instead of doubt the fact ought to receive it as certain and ought to search for the cause whence it might be derive the decay corruption and dissolution of nature be an event render probable by so many analogies that any phenomenon which seem to have a tendency towards that catastrophe come within the reach of human testimony if that testimony be very extensive and uniform but suppose that all the historians who treat of england should agree that on the first of january queen elizabeth die that both before and after her death she be see by her physicians and the whole court as be usual with persons of her rank that her successor be acknowledge and proclaim by the parliament and that after be inter a month she again appear resume the throne and govern england for three years must confess that should be surprise at the concurrence of so many odd circumstances but should not have the least inclination to believe so miraculous an event should not doubt of her pretend death and of those other public circumstances that follow it should only assert it to have be pretend and that it neither be nor possibly could be real you would in vain object to me the difficulty and almost impossibility of deceive the world in an affair of such consequence the wisdom and solid judgement of that renowned queen with the little or no advantage which she could reap from so poor an artifice all this might astonish me but would still reply that the knavery and folly of men be such common phenomena that should rather believe the most extraordinary events to arise from their concurrence than admit of so signal a violation of the laws of nature but should this miracle be ascribe to any new system of religion men in all age have be so much impose on by ridiculous stories of that kind that this very circumstance would be a full proof of a cheat and sufficient with all men of sense not only to make them reject the fact but even reject it without farther examination though the be to whom the miracle be ascribe be in this case almighty it do not upon that account become a whit more probable since it be impossible for us to know the attribute or action of such a be otherwise than from the experience which we have of his productions in the usual course of nature this still reduce us to past observation and oblige us to compare the instance of the violation of truth in the testimony of men with those of the violation of the laws of nature by miracles in order to judge which of them be most likely and probable as the violations of truth be more common in the testimony concern religious miracles than in that concern any other matter of fact this must diminish very much the authority of the former testimony and make us form a general resolution never to lend any attention to it with whatever specious pretence it may be cover lord bacon seem to have embrace the same principles of reason we ought say he to make a collection or particular history of all monsters and prodigious birth or productions and in a word of everything new rare and extraordinary in nature but this must be do with the most severe scrutiny lest we depart from truth above all every relation must be consider as suspicious which depend in any degree upon religion as the prodigies of livy and no less so everything that be to be find in the writers of natural magic or alchemy or such author who seem all of them to have an unconquerable appetite for falsehood and fable be the better please with the method of reason here deliver as think it may serve to confound those dangerous friends or disguise enemies to the christian religion who have undertake to defend it by the principles of human reason our most holy religion be found on faith not on reason and it be a sure method of expose it to put it to such a trial as it be by no mean fit to endure to make this more evident let us examine those miracles relate in scripture and not to lose ourselves in too wide a field let us confine ourselves to such as we find in the pentateuch which we shall examine accord to the principles of these pretend christians not as the word or testimony of god himself but as the production of a mere human writer and historian here then we be first to consider a book present to us by a barbarous and ignorant people write in an age when they be still more barbarous and in all probability long after the facts which it relate corroborate by no concur testimony and resemble those fabulous account which every nation give of its origin upon read this book we find it full of prodigies and miracles it give an account of a state of the world and of human nature entirely different from the present of our fall from that state of the age of man extend to near a thousand years of the destruction of the world by a deluge of the arbitrary choice of one people as the favourites of heaven and that people the countrymen of the author of their deliverance from bondage by prodigies the most astonish imaginable desire anyone to lay his hand upon his heart and after a serious consideration declare whether he think that the falsehood of such a book support by such a testimony would be more extraordinary and miraculous than all the miracles it relate which be however necessary to make it be receive accord to the measure of probability above establish what we have say of miracles may be apply without any variation to prophecies and indeed all prophecies be real miracles and as such only can be admit as proof of any revelation if it do not exceed the capacity of human nature to foretell future events it would be absurd to employ any prophecy as an argument for a divine mission or authority from heaven so that upon the whole we may conclude that the christian religion not only be at first attend with miracles but even at this day can not be believe by any reasonable person without one mere reason be insufficient to convince us of its veracity and whoever be move by faith to assent to it be conscious of a continue miracle in his own person which subvert all the principles of his understand and give him a determination to believe what be most contrary to custom and experience sect of a particular providence and of a future state be lately engage in conversation with a friend who love sceptical paradoxes where though he advance many principles of which can by no mean approve yet as they seem to be curious and to bear some relation to the chain of reason carry on throughout this enquiry shall here copy them from my memory as accurately as can in order to submit them to the judgement of the reader our conversation begin with my admire the singular good fortune of philosophy which as it require entire liberty above all other privilege and chiefly flourish from the free opposition of sentiments and argumentation receive its first birth in an age and country of freedom and toleration and be never cramp even in its most extravagant principles by any creeds concessions or penal statutes for except the banishment of protagoras and the death of socrates which last event proceed partly from other motives there be scarcely any instance to be meet with in ancient history of this bigotted jealousy with which the present age be so much infest epicurus live at athens to an advance age in peace and tranquillity epicureans be even admit to receive the sacerdotal character and to officiate at the altar in the most sacred rites of the establish religion and the public encouragement of pension and salaries be afford equally by the wisest of all the roman emperors to the professors of every sect of philoso phy how requisite such kind of treatment be to philosophy in her early youth will easily be conceive if we reflect that even at present when she may be suppose more hardy and robust she bear with much difficulty the inclemency of the season and those harsh wind of calumny and persecution which blow upon her you admire say my friend as the singular good fortune of philosophy what seem to result from the natural course of things and to be unavoidable in every age and nation this pertinacious bigotry of which you complain as so fatal to philosophy be really her offspring who after ally with superstition separate himself entirely from the interest of his parent and become her most inveterate enemy and persecutor speculative dogmas of religion the present occasion of such furious dispute could not possibly be conceive or admit in the early age of the world when mankind be wholly illiterate form an idea of religion more suitable to their weak apprehension and compose their sacred tenets of such tales chiefly as be the object of traditional belief more than of argument or disputation after the first alarm therefore be over which arise from the new paradoxes and principles of the philosophers these teachers seem ever after during the age of antiquity to have live in great harmony with the establish superstition and to have make a fair partition of mankind between them the former claim all the learn and wise the latter possess all the vulgar and illiterate it seem then say that you leave politics entirely out of the question and never suppose that a wise magistrate can justly be jealous of certain tenets of philosophy such as those of epicurus which deny a divine existence and consequently a providence and a future state seem to loosen in a great measure the tie of morality and may be suppose for that reason pernicious to the peace of civil society know reply he that in fact these persecutions never in any age proceed from calm reason or from experience of the pernicious consequences of philosophy but arise entirely from passion and prejudice but what if should advance farther and assert that if epicurus have be accuse before the people by any of the sycophants or informers of those days he could easily have defend his cause and prove his principles of philosophy to be as salutary as those of his adversaries who endeavour with such zeal to expose him to the public hatred and jealousy wish say you would try your eloquence upon so extraordinary a topic and make a speech for epicurus which might satisfy not the mob of athens if you will allow that ancient and polite city to have contain any mob but the more philosophical part of his audience such as might be suppose capable of comprehend his arguments the matter would not be difficult upon such condition reply he and if you please shall suppose myself epicurus for a moment and make you stand for the athenian people and shall deliver you such an harangue as will fill all the urn with white bean and leave not a black one to gratify the malice of my adversaries very well pray proceed upon these suppositions come hither o ye athenians to justify in your assembly what maintain in my school and find myself impeach by furious antagonists instead of reason with calm and dispassionate enquirers your deliberations which of right should be direct to question of public good and the interest of the commonwealth be divert to the disquisitions of speculative philosophy and these magnificent but perhaps fruitless enquiries take place of your more familiar but more useful occupations but so far as in me lie will prevent this abuse we shall not here dispute concern the origin and government of worlds we shall only enquire how far such question concern the public interest and if can persuade you that they be entirely indifferent to the peace of society and security of government hope that you will presently send us back to our school there to examine at leisure the question the most sublime but at the same time the most speculative of all philosophy the religious philosophers not satisfy with the tradition of your forefathers and doctrine of your priests in which willingly acquiesce indulge a rash curiosity in try how far they can establish religion upon the principles of reason and they thereby excite instead of satisfy the doubt which naturally arise from a diligent and scrutinous enquiry they paint in the most magnificent colour the order beauty and wise arrangement of the universe and then ask if such a glorious display of intelligence could proceed from the fortuitous concourse of atoms or if chance could produce what the greatest genius can never sufficiently admire shall not examine the justness of this argument shall allow it to be as solid as my antagonists and accusers can desire it be sufficient if can prove from this very reason that the question be entirely speculative and that when in my philosophical disquisitions deny a providence and a future state undermine not the foundations of society but advance principles which they themselves upon their own topics if they argue consistently must allow to be solid and satisfactory you then who be my accusers have acknowledge that the chief or sole argument for a divine existence which never question be derive from the order of nature where there appear such mark of intelligence and design that you think it extravagant to assign for its cause either chance or the blind and unguided force of matter you allow that this be an argument draw from effect to cause from the order of the work you infer that there must have be project and forethought in the workman if you can not make out this point you allow that your conclusion fail and you pretend not to establish the conclusion in a greater latitude than the phenomena of nature will justify these be your concessions desire you to mark the consequences when we infer any particular cause from an effect we must proportion the one to the other and can never be allow to ascribe to the cause any qualities but what be exactly sufficient to produce the effect a body of ten ounces raise in any scale may serve as a proof that the counterbalance weight exceed ten ounces but can never afford a reason that it exceed a hundred if the cause assign for any effect be not sufficient to produce it we must either reject that cause or add to it such qualities as will give it a just proportion to the effect but if we ascribe to it farther qualities or affirm it capable of produce other effect we can only indulge the licence of conjecture and arbitrarily suppose the existence of qualities and energies without reason or authority the same rule hold whether the cause assign be brute unconscious matter or a rational intelligent be if the cause be know only by the effect we never ought to ascribe to it any qualities beyond what be precisely requisite to produce the effect nor can we by any rule of just reason return back from the cause and infer other effect from it beyond those by which alone it be know to us no one merely from the sight of one of zeuxiss picture could know that he be also a statuary or architect and be an artist no less skilful in stone and marble than in colour the talents and taste display in the particular work before us these we may safely conclude the workman to be possess of the cause must be proportion to the effect and if we exactly and precisely proportion it we shall never find in it any qualities that point farther or afford an inference concern any other design or perfor mance such qualities must be somewhat beyond what be merely requisite for produce the effect which we examine allow therefore the gods to be the author of the existence or order of the universe it follow that they possess that precise degree of power intelligence and benevolence which appear in their workmanship but nothing farther can ever be prove except we call in the assistance of exaggeration and flattery to supply the defect of argument and reason so far as the trace of any attribute at present appear so far may we conclude these attribute to exist the supposition of farther attribute be mere hypothesis much more the supposition that in distant regions of space or periods of time there have be or will be a more magnificent display of these attribute and a scheme of administration more suitable to such imaginary virtues we can never be allow to mount up from the universe the effect to jupiter the cause and then descend downwards to infer any new effect from that cause as if the present effect alone be not entirely worthy of the glorious attribute which we ascribe to that deity the knowledge of the cause be derive solely from the effect they must be exactly adjust to each other and the one can never refer to anything further or be the foundation of any new inference and conclusion you find certain phenomena in nature you seek a cause or author you imagine that you have find him you afterwards become so enamour of this offspring of your brain that you imagine it impossible but he must produce something greater and more perfect than the present scene of things which be so full of ill and disorder you forget that this superlative intelligence and benevolence be entirely imaginary or at least without any foundation in reason and that you have no grind to ascribe to him any qualities but what you see he have actually exert and display in his productions let your gods therefore o philosophers be suit to the present appearances of nature and presume not to alter these appearances by arbitrary suppositions in order to suit them to the attribute which you so fondly ascribe to your deities when priests and poets support by your authority o athenians talk of a golden or silver age which precede the present state of vice and miscry hear them with attention and with reverence but when philosophers who pretend to neglect authority and to cultivate reason hold the same discourse pay them not own the same obsequious submission and pious deference ask who carry them into the celestial regions who admit them into the councils of the gods who open to them the book of fate that they thus rashly affirm that their deities have execute or will execute any purpose beyond what have actually appear if they tell me that they have mount on the step or by the gradual ascent of reason and by draw inferences from effect to cause still insist that they have aid the ascent of reason by the wing of imagination otherwise they could not thus change their manner of inference and argue from cause to effect presume that a more perfect production than the present world would be more suitable to such perfect be as the gods and forget that they have no reason to ascribe to these celestial be any perfection or any attribute but what can be find in the present world hence all the fruitless industry to account for the ill appearances of nature and save the honour of the gods while we must acknowledge the reality of that evil and disorder with which the world so much abound the obstinate and intractable qualities of matter we be tell or the observance of general laws or some such reason be the sole cause which control the power and benevolence of jupiter and oblige him to create mankind and every sensible creature so imperfect and so unhappy these attribute then be it seem beforehand take for grant in their greatest latitude and upon that supposition own that such conjecture may perhaps be admit as plausible solutions of the ill phenomena but still ask why take these attribute for grant or why ascribe to the cause any qualities but what actually appear in the effect why torture your brain to justify the course of nature upon suppositions which for aught you know may be entirely imaginary and of which there be to be find no trace in the course of nature the religious hypothesis therefore must be consider only as a particular method of account for the visible phenomena of the universe but no just reasoner will ever presume to infer from it any single fact and alter or add to the phenomena in any single particular if you think that the appearances of things prove such cause it be allowable for you to draw an inference concern the existence of these cause in such complicate and sublime subject every one should be indulge in the liberty of conjecture and argument but here you ought to rest if you come backward and argue from your infer cause conclude that any other fact have exist or will exist in the course of nature which may serve as a fuller display of particular attribute must admonish you that you have depart from the method of reason at tached to the present subject and have certainly add something to the attribute of the cause beyond what appear in the effect otherwise you could never with tolerable sense or propriety add anything to the effect in order to render it more worthy of the cause where then be the odiousness of that doctrine which teach in my school or rather which examine in my garden or what do you find in this whole question wherein the security of good morals or the peace and order of society be in the least concern deny a providence you say and supreme governor of the world who guide the course of events and punish the vicious with infamy and disappointment and reward the virtuous with honour and success in all their undertake but surely deny not the course itself of events which lie open to every ones inquiry and examination acknowledge that in the present order of things virtue be attend with more peace of mind than vice and meet with a more favourable reception from the world be sensible that accord to the past experience of mankind friendship be the chief joy of human life and moderation the only source of tranquillity and happiness never balance between the virtuous and the vicious course of life but be sensible that to a welldisposed mind every advantage be on the side of the former and what can you say more allow all your suppositions and reason you tell me indeed that this disposition of things proceed from intelligence and design but whatever it proceed from the disposition itself on which depend our happiness or misery and consequently our conduct and deportment in life be still the same it be still open for me as well as you to regulate my behaviour by my experience of past events and if you affirm that while a divine providence be allow and a supreme distributive justice in the universe ought to expect some more particular reward of the good and punishment of the bad beyond the ordinary course of events here find the same fallacy which have before endeavour to detect you persist in imagine that if we grant that divine existence for which you so earnestly contend you may safely infer consequences from it and add something to the experience order of nature by argue from the attribute which you ascribe to your gods you seem not to remember that all your reason on this subject can only be draw from effect to cause and that every argument deduct from cause to effect must of necessity be a gross sophism since it be impossible for you to know anything of the cause but what you have antecedently not infer but discover to the full in the effect but what must a philosopher think of those vain reasoners who instead of regard the present scene of things as the sole object of their contemplation so far reverse the whole course of nature as to render this life merely a passage to something farther a porch which lead to a greater and vastly different build a prologue which serve only to introduce the piece and give it more grace and propriety whence do you think can such philosophers derive their idea of the gods from their own conceit and imagination surely for if they derive it from the present phenomena it would never point to anything farther but must be exactly adjust to them that the divinity may possibly be endow with attribute which we have never see exert may be govern by principles of action which we can not discover to be satisfy all this will freely be allow but still this be mere possibility and hypothesis we never can have reason to in infer any attribute or any principles of action in him but so far as we know them to have be exert and satisfy be there any mark of a distributive justice in the world if you answer in the affirmative conclude that since justice here exert itself it be satisfy if you reply in the negative conclude that you have then no reason to ascribe justice in our sense of it to the gods if you hold a medium between affirmation and negation by say that the justice of the gods at present exert itself in part but not in its full extent answer that you have no reason to give it any particular extent but only so far as you see it at present exert itself thus bring the dispute o athenians to a short issue with my antagonists the course of nature lie open to my contemplation as well as to theirs the experience train of events be the great standard by which we all regulate our conduct nothing else can be appeal to in the field or in the senate nothing else ought ever to be hear of in the school or in the closet in vain would our limit understand break through those boundaries which be too narrow for our fond imagination while we argue from the course of nature and infer a particular intelligent cause which first bestow and still preserve order in the universe we embrace a principle which be both uncertain and useless it be uncertain because the subject lie entirely beyond the reach of human experience it be useless because our knowledge of this cause be derive entirely from the course of nature we can never accord to the rule of just reason return back from the cause with any new inference or make additions to the common and experience course of nature establish any new principles of conduct and behaviour observe say find he have finish his harangue that you neglect not the artifice of the demagogues of old and as you be please to make me stand for the people you insinuate yourself into my favour by embrace those principles to which you know have always express a particular attachment but allow you to make experience as indeed think you ought the only standard of our judgement concern this and all other question of fact doubt not but from the very same experience to which you appeal it may be possible to refute this reason which you have put into the mouth of epicurus if you saw for instance a halffinished build surround with heap of brick and stone and mortar and all the instrument of masonry could you not infer from the effect that it be a work of design and contrivance and could you not return again from this infer cause to infer new additions to the effect and conclude that the build would soon be finish and receive all the further improvements which art could bestow upon it if you saw upon the seashore the print of one human foot you would conclude that a man have pass that way and that he have also leave the trace of the other foot though efface by the roll of the sand or inundation of the water why then do you refuse to admit the same method of reason with regard to the order of nature consider the world and the present life only as an imperfect build from which you can infer a superior intelligence and argue from that superior intelligence which can leave nothing imperfect why may you not infer a more finish scheme or plan which will receive its completion in some distant point of space or time be not these methods of reason exactly similar and under what pretence can you embrace the one while you reject the other the infinite difference of the subject reply he be a sufficient foundation for this difference in my conclusions in work of human art and contrivance it be allowable to advance from the effect to the cause and return back from the cause to form new inferences concern the effect and examine the alterations which it have probably undergo or may still undergo but what be the foundation of this method of reason plainly this that man be a be whom we know by experience whose motives and design we be acquaint with and whose project and inclinations have a certain connexion and coherence accord to the laws which nature have establish for the government of such a creature when therefore we find that any work have proceed from the skill and industry of man as we be otherwise acquaint with the nature of the animal we can draw a hundred inferences concern what may be expect from him and these inferences will all be found in experience and observation but do we know man only from the single work or production which we examine it be impossible for us to argue in this manner because our knowledge of all the qualities which we ascribe to him be in that case derive from the production it be impossible they could point to anything farther or be the foundation of any new inference the print of a foot in the sand can only prove when consider alone that there be some figure adapt to it by which it be produce but the print of a human foot prove likewise from our other experience that there be probably another foot which also leave its impression though efface by time or other accidents here we mount from the effect to the cause and descend again from the cause infer alterations in the effect but this be not a continuation of the same simple chain of reason we comprehend in this case a hundred other experience and observations concern the usual figure and members of that species of animal without which this method of argument must be consider as fallacious and sophistical the case be not the same with our reason from the work of nature the deity be know to us only by his productions and be a single be in the universe not comprehend under any species or genus from whose experience attribute or qualities we can by analogy infer any attribute or quality in him as the universe shew wisdom and goodness we infer wisdom and goodness as it shew a particular degree of these perfections we infer a particular degree of them precisely adapt to the effect which we examine but farther attribute or farther degrees of the same attribute we can never be authorise to infer or suppose by any rule of just reason now without some such licence of supposition it be impossible for us to argue from the cause or infer any alteration in the effect beyond what have immediately fall under our observation greater good produce by this be must still prove a greater degree of goodness a more impartial distribution of reward and punishments must proceed from a greater regard to justice and equity every suppose addition to the work of nature make an addition to the attribute of the author of nature and consequently be entirely unsupported by any reason or argument can never be admit but as mere conjecture and hypothesis the great source of our mistake in this subject and of the unbounded licence of conjecture which we indulge be that we tacitly consider ourselves as in the place of the supreme be and conclude that he will on every occasion observe the same conduct which we ourselves in his situation would have embrace as reasonable and eligible but besides that the ordinary course of nature may convince us that almost everything be regulate by principles and maxims very different from ours besides this say it must evidently appear contrary to all rule of analogy to reason from the intentions and project of men to those of a be so different and so much superior in human nature there be a certain experience coherence of design and inclinations so that when from any fact we have discover one intention of any man it may often be reasonable from experience to infer another and draw a long chain of conclusions concern his past or future conduct but this method of reason can never have place with regard to a be so remote and incomprehensible who bear much less analogy to any other be in the universe than the sun to a waxen taper and who discover himself only by some faint trace or outline beyond which we have no authority to ascribe to him any attribute or perfection what we imagine to be a superior perfection may really be a defect or be it ever so much a perfection the ascribe of it to the supreme be where it appear not to have be really exert to the full in his work savour more of flattery and panegyric than of just reason and sound philosophy all the philosophy therefore in the world and all the religion which be nothing but a species of philosophy will never be able to carry us beyond the usual course of experience or give us measure of conduct and behaviour different from those which be furnish by reflections on common life no new fact can ever be infer from the religious hypothesis no event foresee or foretell no reward or punishment expect or dread beyond what be already know by practice and observation so that my apology for epicurus will still appear solid and satisfactory nor have the political interest of society any connexion with the philosophical dispute concern metaphysics and religion there be still one circumstance reply which you seem to have overlook though should allow your premise must deny your conclusion you conclude that religious doctrines and reason can have no influence on life because they ought to have no influence never consider that men reason not in the same manner you do but draw many consequences from the belief of a divine existence and suppose that the deity will inflict punishments on vice and bestow reward on virtue beyond what appear in the ordinary course of nature whether this reason of theirs be just or not be no matter its influence on their life and conduct must still be the same and those who attempt to disabuse them of such prejudice may for aught know be good reasoners but can not allow them to be good citizens and politicians since they free men from one restraint upon their passions and make the infringement of the laws of society in one respect more easy and secure after all may perhaps agree to your general conclusion in favour of liberty though upon different premise from those on which you endeavour to find it think that the state ought to tolerate every principle of philosophy nor be there an instance that any government have suffer in its political interest by such indulgence there be no enthusiasm among philosophers their doctrines be not very allure to the people and no restraint can be put upon their reason but what must be of dangerous consequence to the sciences and even to the state by pave the way for persecution and oppression in point where the generality of mankind be more deeply interest and concern but there occur to me continue with regard to your main topic a difficulty which shall just propose to you without insist on it lest it lead into reason of too nice and delicate a nature in a word much doubt whether it be possible for a cause to be know only by its effect as you have all along suppose or to be of so singular and particular a nature as to have no parallel and no similarity with any other cause or object that have ever fall under our observation it be only when two species of object be find to be constantly conjoin that we can infer the one from the other and be an effect present which be entirely singular and could not be comprehend under any know species do not see that we could form any conjecture or inference at all concern its cause if experience and observation and analogy be indeed the only guide which we can reasonably follow in inferences of this nature both the effect and cause must bear a similarity and resemblance to other effect and cause which we know and which we have find in many instance to be conjoin with each other leave it to your own reflection to pursue the consequences of this principle shall just observe that as the antagonists of epicurus always suppose the universe an effect quite singular and unparalleled to be the proof of a deity a cause no less singular and unparalleled your reason upon that supposition seem at least to merit our attention there be own some difficulty how we can ever return from the cause to the effect and reason from our ideas of the former infer any alteration on the latter or any addition to it sect of the academical or sceptical philosophy part there be not a greater number of philosophical reason display upon any subject than those which prove the existence of a deity and refute the fallacies of atheists and yet the most religious philosophers still dispute whether any man can be so blind as to be a speculative atheist how shall we reconcile these contradictions the knightserrant who wander about to clear the world of dragons and giants never entertain the least doubt with regard to the existence of these monsters the sceptic be another enemy of religion who naturally provoke the indignation of all divine and graver philosophers though it be certain that no man ever meet with any such absurd creature or converse with a man who have no opinion or principle concern any subject either of action or speculation this beget a very natural question what be mean by a sceptic and how far it be possible to push these philosophical principles of doubt and uncertainty there be a species of scepticism antecedent to all study and philosophy which be much inculcate by des cart and others as a sovereign preservative against error and precipitate judgement it recommend an universal doubt not only of all our former opinions and principles but also of our very faculties of whose veracity say they we must assure ourselves by a chain of reason deduce from some original principle which can not possibly be fallacious or deceitful but neither be there any such original principle which have a prerogative above others that be selfevident and convince or if there be could we advance a step beyond it but by the use of those very faculties of which we be suppose to be already diffident the cartesian doubt therefore be it ever possible to be attain by any human creature as it plainly be not would be entirely incurable and no reason could ever bring us to a state of assurance and conviction upon any subject it must however be confess that this species of scepticism when more moderate may be understand in a very reasonable sense and be a necessary preparative to the study of philosophy by preserve a proper impartiality in our judgements and wean our mind from all those prejudice which we may have imbibe from education or rash opinion to begin with clear and selfevident principles to advance by timorous and sure step to review frequently our conclusions and examine accurately all their consequences though by these mean we shall make both a slow and a short progress in our systems be the only methods by which we can ever hope to reach truth and attain a proper stability and certainty in our determinations there be another species of scepticism consequent to science and enquiry when men be suppose to have discover either the absolute fallaciousness of their mental faculties or their unfitness to reach any fix determination in all those curious subject of speculation about which they be commonly employ even our very sense be bring into dispute by a certain species of philosophers and the maxims of common life be subject to the same doubt as the most profound principles or conclusions of metaphysics and theology as these paradoxical tenets if they may be call tenets be to be meet with in some philosophers and the refutation of them in several they naturally excite our curiosity and make us enquire into the arguments on which they may be found need not insist upon the more trite topics employ by the sceptics in all age against the evidence of sense such as those which be derive from the imperfection and fallaciousness of our organs on numberless occasion the crook appearance of an oar in water the various aspects of object accord to their different distance the double image which arise from the press one eye with many other appearances of a like nature these sceptical topics indeed be only sufficient to prove that the sense alone be not implicitly to be depend on but that we must correct their evidence by reason and by considerations derive from the nature of the medium the distance of the object and the disposition of the organ in order to render them within their sphere the proper criteria of truth and falsehood there be other more profound arguments against the sense which admit not of so easy a solution it seem evident that men be carry by a natural instinct or prepossession to repose faith in their sense and that without any reason or even almost before the use of reason we always suppose an external universe which depend not on our perception but would exist though we and every sensible creature be absent or annihilate even the animal creation be govern by a like opinion and preserve this belief of external object in all their thoughts design and action it seem also evident that when men follow this blind and powerful instinct of nature they always suppose the very image present by the sense to be the external object and never entertain any suspicion that the one be nothing but representations of the other this very table which we see white and which we feel hard be believe to exist independent of our perception and to be something external to our mind which perceive it our presence bestow not be on it our absence do not annihilate it it preserve its existence uniform and entire independent of the situation of intelligent be who perceive or contemplate it but this universal and primary opinion of all men be soon destroy by the slightest philosophy which teach us that nothing can ever be present to the mind but an image or perception and that the sense be only the inlets through which these image be convey without be able to produce any immediate intercourse between the mind and the object the table which we see seem to diminish as we remove farther from it but the real table which exist independent of us suffer no alteration it be therefore nothing but its image which be present to the mind these be the obvious dictate of reason and no man who reflect ever doubt that the existences which we consider when we say this house and that tree be nothing but perceptions in the mind and fleet copy or representations of other existences which remain uniform and independent so far then be we necessitate by reason to contradict or depart from the primary instincts of nature and to embrace a new system with regard to the evidence of our sense but here philosophy find herself extremely embarrass when she would justify this new system and obviate the cavil and objections of the sceptics she can no longer plead the infallible and irresistible instinct of nature for that lead us to a quite different system which be acknowledge fallible and even erroneous and to justify this pretend philosophical system by a chain of clear and convince argument or even any appearance of argument exceed the power of all human capacity by what argument can it be prove that the perceptions of the mind must be cause by external object entirely different from them though resemble them if that be possible and could not arise either from the energy of the mind itself or from the suggestion of some invisible and unknown spirit or from some other cause still more unknown to us it be acknowledge that in fact many of these perceptions arise not from anything external as in dream madness and other diseases and nothing can be more inexplicable than the manner in which body should so operate upon mind as ever to convey an image of itself to a substance suppose of so different and even contrary a nature it be a question of fact whether the perceptions of the sense be produce by external object resemble them how shall this question be determine by experience surely as all other question of a like nature but here experience be and must be entirely silent the mind have never anything present to it but the perceptions and can not possibly reach any experience of their connexion with object the supposition of such a connexion be therefore without any foundation in reason to have recourse to the veracity of the supreme be in order to prove the veracity of our sense be surely make a very unexpected circuit if his veracity be at all concern in this matter our sense would be entirely infallible because it be not possible that he can ever deceive not to mention that if the external world be once call in question we shall be at a loss to find arguments by which we may prove the existence of that be or any of his attribute this be a topic therefore in which the profounder and more philosophical sceptics will always triumph when they endeavour to introduce an universal doubt into all subject of human knowledge and enquiry do you follow the instincts and propensities of nature may they say in assent to the veracity of sense but these lead you to believe that the very perception or sensible image be the external object do you disclaim this principle in order to embrace a more rational opinion that the perceptions be only representations of something external you here depart from your natural propensities and more obvious sentiments and yet be not able to satisfy your reason which can never find any convince argument from experience to prove that the perceptions be connect with any external object there be another sceptical topic of a like nature derive from the most profound philosophy which might merit our attention be it requisite to dive so deep in order to discover arguments and reason which can so little serve to any serious purpose it be universally allow by modern enquirers that all the sensible qualities of object such as hard soft hot cold white black c be merely secondary and exist not in the object themselves but be perceptions of the mind without any external archetype or model which they represent if this be allow with regard to secondary qualities it must also follow with regard to the suppose primary qualities of extension and solidity nor can the latter be any more entitle to that denomination than the former the idea of extension be entirely acquire from the sense of sight and feel and if all the qualities perceive by the sense be in the mind not in the object the same conclusion must reach the idea of extension which be wholly dependent on the sensible ideas or the ideas of secondary qualities nothing can save us from this conclusion but the assert that the ideas of those primary qualities be attain by abstraction an opinion which if we examine it accurately we shall find to be unintelligible and even absurd an extension that be neither tangible nor visible can not possibly be conceive and a tangible or visible extension which be neither hard nor soft black nor white be equally beyond the reach of human conception let any man try to conceive a triangle in general which be neither isosceles nor scalenum nor have any particular length or proportion of side and he will soon perceive the absurdity of all the scholastic notions with regard to abstraction and general ideas thus the first philosophical objection to the evidence of sense or to the opinion of external existence consist in this that such an opinion if rest on natural instinct be contrary to reason and if refer to reason be contrary to natural instinct and at the same time carry no rational evidence with it to convince an impartial enquirer the second objection go farther and represent this opinion as contrary to reason at least if it be a principle of reason that all sensible qualities be in the mind not in the object bereave matter of all its intelligible qualities both primary and secondary you in a manner annihilate it and leave only a certain unknown inexplicable something as the cause of our perceptions a notion so imperfect that no sceptic will think it worth while to contend against it part it may seem a very extravagant attempt of the sceptics to destroy reason by argument and ratiocination yet be this the grand scope of all their enquiries and dispute they endeavour to find objections both to our abstract reason and to those which regard matter of fact and existence the chief objection against all abstract reason be derive from the ideas of space and time ideas which in common life and to a careless view be very clear and intelligible but when they pass through the scrutiny of the profound sciences and they be the chief object of these sciences afford principles which seem full of absurdity and contradiction no priestly dogmas invent on purpose to tame and subdue the rebellious reason of mankind ever shock common sense more than the doctrine of the infinitive divisibility of extension with its consequences as they be pompously display by all geometricians and metaphysicians with a kind of triumph and exultation a real quantity infinitely less than any finite quantity contain quantities infinitely less than itself and so on in infinitum this be an edifice so bold and prodigious that it be too weighty for any pretend demonstration to support because it shock the clearest and most natural principles of human reason but what render the matter more extraordinary be that these seemingly absurd opinions be support by a chain of reason the clearest and most natural nor be it possible for us to allow the premise without admit the consequences nothing can be more convince and satisfactory than all the conclusions concern the properties of circle and triangles and yet when these be once receive how can we deny that the angle of contact between a circle and its tangent be infinitely less than any rectilineal angle that as you may increase the diameter of the circle in infinitum this angle of contact become still less even in infinitum and that the angle of contact between other curve and their tangents may be infinitely less than those between any circle and its tangent and so on in infinitum the demonstration of these principles seem as unexceptionable as that which prove the three angle of a triangle to be equal to two right ones though the latter opinion be natural and easy and the former big with contradiction and absurdity reason here seem to be throw into a kind of amazement and suspence which without the suggestions of any sceptic give her a diffidence of herself and of the grind on which she tread she see a full light which illuminate certain place but that light border upon the most profound darkness and between these she be so dazzle and confound that she scarcely can pronounce with certainty and assurance concern any one object the absurdity of these bold determinations of the abstract sciences seem to become if possible still more palpable with regard to time than extension an infinite number of real part of time pass in succession and exhaust one after another appear so evident a contradiction that no man one should think whose judgement be not corrupt instead of be improve by the sciences would ever be able to admit of it yet still reason must remain restless and unquiet even with regard to that scepticism to which she be drive by these seem absurdities and contradictions how any clear distinct idea can contain circumstances contradictory to itself or to any other clear distinct idea be absolutely incomprehensible and be perhaps as absurd as any proposition which can be form so that nothing can be more sceptical or more full of doubt and hesitation than this scepticism itself which arise from some of the paradoxical conclusions of geometry or the science of quantity the sceptical objections to moral evidence or to the reason concern matter of fact be either popular or philosophical the popular objections be derive from the natural weakness of human understand the contradictory opinions which have be entertain in different age and nations the variations of our judgement in sickness and health youth and old age prosperity and adversity the perpetual contradiction of each particular man opinions and sentiments with many other topics of that kind it be needle to insist farther on this head these objections be but weak for as in common life we reason every moment concern fact and existence and can not possibly subsist without continually employ this species of argument any popular objections derive from thence must be insufficient to destroy that evidence the great subverter of pyrrhonism or the excessive principles of scepticism be action and employment and the occupations of common life these principles may flourish and triumph in the school where it be indeed difficult if not impossible to refute them but as soon as they leave the shade and by the presence of the real object which actuate our passions and sentiments be put in opposition to the more powerful principles of our nature they vanish like smoke and leave the most determine sceptic in the same condition as other mortals the sceptic therefore have better keep within his proper sphere and display those philosophical objections which arise from more profound research here he seem to have ample matter of triumph while he justly insist that all our evidence for any matter of fact which lie beyond the testimony of sense or memory be derive entirely from the relation of cause and effect that we have no other idea of this relation than that of two object which have be frequently conjoin together that we have no argument to convince us that object which have in our experience be frequently conjoin will likewise in other instance be conjoin in the same manner and that nothing lead us to this inference but custom or a certain instinct of our nature which it be indeed difficult to resist but which like other instincts may be fallacious and deceitful while the sceptic insist upon these topics he show his force or rather indeed his own and our weakness and seem for the time at least to destroy all assurance and conviction these arguments might be display at greater length if any durable good or benefit to society could ever be expect to result from them for here be the chief and most confound objection to excessive scepticism that no durable good can ever result from it while it remain in its full force and vigour we need only ask such a sceptic what his mean be and what he propose by all these curious research he be immediately at a loss and know not what to answer a copernican or ptolemaic who support each his different system of astronomy may hope to produce a conviction which will remain constant and durable with his audience a stoic or epicurean display principles which may not be durable but which have an effect on conduct and behaviour but a pyrrhonian can not expect that his philosophy will have any constant influence on the mind or if it have that its influence would be beneficial to society on the contrary he must acknowledge if he will acknowledge anything that all human life must perish be his principles universally and steadily to prevail all discourse all action would immediately cease and men remain in a total lethargy till the necessities of nature unsatisfied put an end to their miserable existence it be true so fatal an event be very little to be dread nature be always too strong for principle and though a pyrrhonian may throw himself or others into a momentary amazement and confusion by his profound reason the first and most trivial event in life will put to flight all his doubt and scruple and leave him the same in every point of action and speculation with the philosophers of every other sect or with those who never concern themselves in any philosophical research when he awake from his dream he will be the first to join in the laugh against himself and to confess that all his objections be mere amusement and can have no other tendency than to show the whimsical condition of mankind who must act and reason and believe though they be not able by their most diligent enquiry to satisfy themselves concern the foundation of these operations or to remove the objections which may be raise against them part there be indeed a more mitigate scepticism or academical philosophy which may be both durable and useful and which may in part be the result of this pyrrhonism or excessive scepticism when its undistinguished doubt be in some measure correct by common sense and reflection the greater part of mankind be naturally apt to be affirmative and dogmatical in their opinions and while they see object only on one side and have no idea of any counterpoise argument they throw themselves precipitately into the principles to which they be incline nor have they any indulgence for those who entertain opposite sentiments to hesitate or balance perplex their understand check their passion and suspend their action they be therefore impatient till they escape from a state which to them be so uneasy and they think that they could never remove themselves far enough from it by the violence of their affirmations and obstinacy of their belief but could such dogmatical reasoners become sensible of the strange infirmities of human understand even in its most perfect state and when most accurate and cautious in its determinations such a reflection would naturally inspire them with more modesty and reserve and diminish their fond opinion of themselves and their prejudice against antagonists the illiterate may reflect on the disposition of the learn who amidst all the advantage of study and reflection be commonly still diffident in their determinations and if any of the learn be incline from their natural temper to haughtiness and obstinacy a small tincture of pyrrhonism might abate their pride by show them that the few advantage which they may have attain over their fellows be but inconsiderable if compare with the universal perplexity and confusion which be inherent in human nature in general there be a degree of doubt and caution and modesty which in all kinds of scrutiny and decision ought for ever to accompany a just reasoner another species of mitigate scepticism which may be of advantage to mankind and which may be the natural result of the pyrrhonian doubt and scruple be the limitation of our enquiries to such subject as be best adapt to the narrow capacity of human understand the imagination of man be naturally sublime delight with whatever be re mote and extraordinary and run without control into the most distant part of space and time in order to avoid the object which custom have render too familiar to it a correct judgement observe a contrary method and avoid all distant and high enquiries confine itself to common life and to such subject as fall under daily practice and experience leave the more sublime topics to the embellishment of poets and orators or to the arts of priests and politicians to bring us to so salutary a determination nothing can be more serviceable than to be once thoroughly convince of the force of the pyrrhonian doubt and of the impossibility that anything but the strong power of natural instinct could free us from it those who have a propensity to philosophy will still continue their research because they reflect that besides the immediate pleasure attend such an occupation philosophical decisions be nothing but the reflections of common life methodized and correct but they will never be tempt to go beyond common life so long as they consider the imperfection of those faculties which they employ their narrow reach and their inaccurate operations while we can not give a satisfactory reason why we believe after a thousand experiment that a stone will fall or fire burn can we ever satisfy ourselves concern any determination which we may form with regard to the origin of worlds and the situation of nature from and to eternity this narrow limitation indeed of our enquiries be in every respect so reasonable that it suffice to make the slightest examination into the natural power of the human mind and to compare them with their object in order to recommend it to us we shall then find what be the proper subject of science and enquiry it seem to me that the only object of the abstract science or of demonstration be quantity and number and that all attempt to extend this more perfect species of knowledge beyond these bound be mere sophistry and illusion as the component part of quantity and number be entirely similar their relations become intricate and involve and nothing can be more curious as well as useful than to trace by a variety of mediums their equality or inequality through their different appearances but as all other ideas be clearly distinct and different from each other we can never advance farther by our utmost scrutiny than to observe this diversity and by an obvious reflection pronounce one thing not to be another or if there be any difficulty in these decisions it proceed entirely from the undeterminate mean of word which be correct by juster definitions that the square of the hypothenuse be equal to the square of the other two side can not be know let the term be ever so exactly define without a train of reason and enquiry but to convince us of this proposition that where there be no property there can be no injustice it be only necessary to define the term and explain injustice to be a violation of property this proposition be indeed nothing but a more imperfect definition it be the same case with all those pretend syllogistical reason which may be find in every other branch of learn except the sciences of quantity and number and these may safely think be pronounce the only proper object of knowledge and demonstration all other enquiries of men regard only matter of fact and existence and these be evidently incapable of demonstration whatever be may not be no negation of a fact can involve a contradiction the nonexistence of any be without exception be as clear and distinct an idea as its existence the proposition which affirm it not to be however false be no less conceivable and intelligible than that which affirm it to be the case be different with the sciences properly so call every proposition which be not true be there confuse and unintelligible that the cube root of be equal to the half of be a false proposition and can never be distinctly conceive but that caesar or the angel gabriel or any be never exist may be a false proposition but still be perfectly conceivable and imply no contradiction the existence therefore of any be can only be prove by arguments from its cause or its effect and these arguments be found entirely on experience if we reason a priori anything may appear able to produce anything the fall of a pebble may for aught we know extinguish the sun or the wish of a man control the planets in their orbit it be only experience which teach us the nature and bound of cause and effect and enable us to infer the existence of one object from that of another such be the foundation of moral reason which form the greater part of human knowledge and be the source of all human action and behaviour moral reason be either concern particular or general facts all deliberations in life regard the former as also all disquisitions in history chronology geography and astronomy the sciences which treat of general facts be politics natural philosophy physic chemistry c where the qualities cause and effect of a whole species of object be enquire into divinity or theology as it prove the existence of a deity and the immortality of souls be compose partly of reason concern particular partly concern general facts it have a foundation in reason so far as it be support by experience but its best and most solid foundation be faith and divine revelation morals and criticism be not so properly object of the understand as of taste and sentiment beauty whether moral or natural be felt more properly than perceive or if we reason concern it and endeavor to fix its standard we regard a new fact to wit the general taste of mankind or some such fact which may be the object of reason and enquiry when we run over libraries persuade of these principles what havoc must we make if we take in our hand any volume of divinity or school metaphysics for instance let us ask do it contain any abstract reason concern quantity or number no do it contain any experimental reason concern matter of fact and existence no commit it then to the flame for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion the end note it be probable that no more be mean by those who deny innate ideas than that all ideas be copy of our impressions though it must be confess that the term which they employ be not choose with such caution nor so exactly define as to prevent all mistake about their doctrine for what be mean by innate if innate be equivalent to natural then all the perceptions and ideas of the mind must be allow to be innate or natural in whatever sense we take the latter word whether in opposition to what be uncommon artificial or miraculous if by innate be mean contemporary to our birth the dispute seem to be frivolous nor be it worth while to enquire at what time think begin whether before at or after our birth again the word idea seem to be commonly take in a very loose sense by locke and others as stand for any of our perceptions our sensations and passions as well as thoughts now in this sense should desire to know what can be mean by assert that selflove or resentment of injuries or the passion between the sex be not innate resemblance contiguity cause and effect for instance contrast or contrariety be also a connexion among ideas but it may perhaps be consider as a mixture of causation and resemblance where two object be contrary the one destroy the other that be the cause of its annihilation and the idea of the annihilation of an object imply the idea of its former existence the word power be here use in a loose and popular sense the more accurate explication of it would give additional evidence to this argument see sect nothing be more useful than for writers even on moral political or physical subject to distinguish between reason and experience and to suppose that these species of argumentation be entirely different from each other the former be take for the mere result of our intellectual faculties which by consider priori the nature of things and examine the effect that must follow from their operation establish particular principles of science and philosophy the latter be suppose to be derive entirely from sense and observation by which we learn what have actually result from the operation of particular object and be thence able to infer what will for the future result from them thus for instance the limitations and restraints of civil government and a legal constitution may be defend either from reason which reflect on the great frailty and corruption of human nature teach that no man can safely be trust with unlimited authority or from experience and history which inform us of the enormous abuse that ambition in every age and country have be find to make of so imprudent a confidence naturane nobis inquit datum dicam an errore

mr locke divide all arguments into demonstrative and probable in this view we must say that it be only probable all men must die or that the sun will rise tomorrow but to conform our language more to common use we ought to divide arguments into demonstrations proof and probabilities by proof mean such arguments from experience as leave no room for doubt or opposition section mr locke in his chapter of power say that find from experience that there be several new productions in matter and conclude that there must somewhere be a power capable of produce them we arrive at last by this reason at the idea of power but no reason can ever give us a new original simple idea as this philosopher himself confess this therefore can never be the origin of that idea it may be pretend that the resistance which we meet with in body oblige us frequently to exert our force and call up all our power this give us the idea of force and power it be this nisus or strong endeavour of which we be conscious that be the original impression from which this idea be copy but first we attribute power to a vast number of object where we never can suppose this resistance of exertion of force to take place to the supreme be who never meet with any resistance to the mind in its command over its ideas and limbs in common think and motion where the effect follow immediately upon the will without any exertion or summon up of force to inanimate matter which be not capable of this sentiment secondly this sentiment of an endeavour to overcome resistance have no know connexion with any event what follow it we know by experience but could not know it a priori it must however be confess that the animal nisus which we experience though it can afford no accurate precise idea of power enter very much into that vulgar inaccurate idea which be form of it theos apo mechanes deus ex machina section need not examine at length the vis inertiae which be so much talk of in the new philosophy and which be ascribe to matter we find by experience that a body at rest or in motion continue for ever in its present state till put from it by some new cause and that a body impel take as much motion from the impel body as it acquire itself these be facts when we call this a vis inertiae we only mark these facts without pretend to have any idea of the inert power in the same manner as when we talk of gravity we mean certain effect without comprehend that active power it be never the mean of sir isaac newton to rob second cause of all force or energy though some of his followers have endeavour to establish that theory upon his authority on the contrary that great philosopher have recourse to an etherial active fluid to explain his universal attraction though he be so cautious and modest as to allow that it be a mere hypothesis not to be insist on without more experiment must confess that there be something in the fate of opinions a little extraordinary descartes insinuate that doctrine of the universal and sole efficacy of the deity without insist on it malebranche and other cartesians make it the foundation of all their philosophy it have however no authority in england locke clarke and cudworth never so much as take notice of it but suppose all along that matter have a real though subordinate and derive power by what mean have it become so prevalent among our modern metaphysicians accord to these explications and definitions the idea of power be relative as much as that of cause and both have a reference to an effect or some other event constantly conjoin with the former when we consider the unknown circumstance of an object by which the degree or quantity of its effect be fix and determine we call that its power and accordingly it be allow by all philosophers that the effect be the measure of the power but if they have any idea of power as it be in itself why could not they measure it in itself the dispute whether the force of a body in motion be as its velocity or the square of its velocity this dispute say need not be decide by compare its effect in equal or unequal time but by a direct mensuration and comparison the prevalence of the doctrine of liberty may be account for from another cause viz a false sensation or seem experience which we have or may have of liberty or indifference in many of our action the necessity of any action whether of matter or of mind be not properly speak a quality in the agent but in any think or intel ligent be who may consider the action and it consist chiefly in the determination of his thoughts to infer the existence of that action from some precede object as liberty when oppose to necessity be nothing but the want of that determination and a certain loosen or indifference which we feel in pass or not pass from the idea of one object to that of any succeed one now we may observe that though in reflect on human action we seldom feel such a loosen or indifference but be commonly able to infer them with considerable certainty from their motives and from the dispositions of the agent yet it frequently happen that in perform the action themselves we be sensible of something like it and as all resemble object be readily take for each other this have be employ as a demonstrative and even intuitive proof of human liberty we feel that our action be subject to our will on most occasion and imagine we feel that the will itself be subject to nothing because when by a denial of it we be provoke to try we feel that it move easily every way and produce an image of itself or a velleity as it be call in the school even on that side on which it do not settle this image or faint motion we persuade ourselves could at that time have be compleated into the thing itself because should that be deny we find upon a second trial that at present it can we consider not that the fantastical desire of shew liberty be here the motive of our action and it seem certain that however we may imagine we feel a liberty within ourselves a spectator can commonly infer our action from our motives and character and even where he can not he conclude in general that he might be he perfectly acquaint with every circumstance of our situation and temper and the most secret spring of our complexion and disposition now this be the very essence of necessity accord to the forego doctrine thus if a cause be define that which produce any thing it be easy to observe that produce be synonimous to cause in like manner if a cause be define that by which any thing exist this be liable to the same objection for what be mean by these word by which have it be say that a cause be that after which any thing constantly exist we should have understand the term for this be indeed all we know of the matter and this constancy form the very essence of necessity nor have we any other idea of it since all reason concern facts or cause be derive merely from custom it may be ask how it happen that men so much surpass animals in reason and one man so much surpass another have not the same custom the same influence on all plutarch marcus cato no indian it be evident could have experience that water do not freeze in cold climates this be place nature in a situation quite unknown to him and it be impossible for him to tell a priori what will result from it it be make a new experiment the consequence of which be always uncertain one may sometimes conjecture from analogy what will follow but still this be but conjecture and it must be confess that in the present case of freeze the event follow contrary to the rule of analogy and be such as a rational indian would not look for the operations of cold upon water be not gradual accord to the degrees of cold but whenever it come to the freeze point the water pass in a moment from the utmost liquidity to perfect hardness such an event therefore may be denominate extraordinary and require a pretty strong testimony to render it credible to people in a war climate but still it be not miraculous nor contrary to uniform experience of the course of nature in case where all the circumstances be the same the inhabitants of sumatra have always see water fluid in their own climate and the freeze of their rivers ought to be deem a prodigy but they never saw water in muscovy during the winter and therefore they can not reasonably be positive what would there be the consequence sometimes an event may not in itself seem to be contrary to the laws of nature and yet if it be real it might by reason of some circumstances be denominate a miracle because in fact it be contrary to these laws thus if a person claim a divine authority should command a sick person to be well a healthful man to fall down dead the cloud to pour rain the wind to blow in short should order many natural events which immediately follow upon his command these might justly be esteem miracles because they be really in this case contrary to the laws of nature for if any suspicion remain that the event and command concur by accident there be no miracle and no transgression of the laws of nature if this suspicion be remove there be evidently a miracle and a transgression of these laws because nothing can be more contrary to nature than that the voice or command of a man should have such an influence a miracle may be accurately define a transgression of a law of nature by a particular volition of the deity or by the interposition of some invisible agent a miracle may either be discoverable by men or not this alter not its nature and essence the raise of a house or ship into the air be a visible miracle the raise of a feather when the wind want ever so little of a force requisite for that purpose be as real a miracle though not so sensible with regard to us histories iv suetonius give nearly the same account live of the caesars vespasian lucretius novum organum aph lucian sump e lapithai the banquet or the lapiths lucian eunouchos the eunuch lucian and dio in general it may think be establish as a maxim that where any cause be know only by its particular effect it must be impossible to infer any new effect from that cause since the qualities which be requisite to produce these new effect along with the former must either be different or superior or of more extensive operation than those which simply produce the effect whence alone the cause be suppose to be know to us we can never therefore have any reason to suppose the existence of these qualities to say that the new effect proceed only from a continuation of the same energy which be already know from the first effect will not remove the difficulty for even grant this to be the case which can seldom be suppose the very continuation and exertion of a like energy for it be impossible it can be absolutely the same say this exertion of a like energy in a different period of space and time be a very arbitrary supposition and what there can not possibly be any trace of in the effect from which all our knowledge of the cause be originally derive let the infer cause be exactly proportion as it should be to the know effect and it be impossible that it can possess any qualities from which new or different effect can be infer this argument be draw from dr berkeley and indeed most of the write of that very ingenious author form the best lessons of scepticism which be to be find either among the ancient or modern philosophers bayle not except he profess however in his title page and undoubtedly with great truth to have compose his book against the sceptics as well as against the atheists and freethinkers but that all his arguments though otherwise intend be in reality merely sceptical appear from this that they admit of no answer and produce no conviction their only effect be to cause that momentary amazement and irresolution and confusion which be the result of scepticism whatever dispute there may be about mathematical point we must allow that there be physical point that be part of extension which can not be divide or lessen either by the eye or imagination these image then which be present to the fancy or sense be absolutely indivisible and consequently must be allow by mathematicians to be infinitely less than any real part of extension and yet nothing appear more certain to reason than that an infinite number of them compose an infinite extension how much more an infinite number of those infinitely small part of extension which be still suppose infinitely divisible it seem to me not impossible to avoid these absurdities and contradictions if it be admit that there be no such thing as abstract or general ideas properly speak but that all general ideas be in reality particular ones attach to a general term which recall upon occasion other particular ones that resemble in certain circumstances the idea present to the mind thus when the term horse be pronounce we immediately figure to ourselves the idea of a black or a white animal of a particular size or figure but as that term be also usually apply to animals of other colour figure and size these ideas though not actually present to the imagination be easily recall and our reason and conclusion proceed in the same way as if they be actually present if this be admit as seem reasonable it follow that all the ideas of quantity upon which mathematicians reason be nothing but particular and such as be suggest by the sense and imagination and consequently can not be infinitely divisible it be sufficient to have drop this hint at present without prosecute it any farther it certainly concern all lovers of science not to expose themselves to the ridicule and contempt of the ignorant by their conclusions and this seem the readiest solution of these difficulties that impious maxim of the ancient philosophy ex nihilo nihil fit by which the creation of matter be exclude cease to be a maxim accord to this philosophy not only the will of the supreme be may create matter but for aught we know a priori the will of any other be might create it or any other cause that the most whimsical imagination can assigndialogues concern natural religion david hume content letter from pamphilus to hermippus dialogues concern natural religion david hume dialogues concern natural religion david hume pamphilus to hermippus letter from pamphilus to hermippus it have be remark that though the ancient philosophers mostly teach through dialogues the dialogue form hasnt be much use in recent time and have seldom succeed when people have try it there be a good reason for this philosophical enquirers these days be expect to produce precise and orderly arguments and someone aim at those will naturally proceed with a methodical exposition in which he can right at the outset explain the point he want to establish and then proceed without interruption to present his proof of it it hardly seem natural to present a system in conversation and there be also another disadvantage of the dialogue form by depart from the direct style of composition the dialoguewriter hop to give a freer air to his performance and to avoid the appearance of author and reader but he risk run into something worse convey the image of teacher and pupil and if he avoid that by conduct the dispute in the natural spirit of good company throw in a variety of arguments and preserve a proper balance among the speakers he often spend so much time set things up and move from one line of think to another that the reader will hardly think that the order brevity and precision which have be lose be make up for by all the grace of dialogue there be some subject however for which dialoguewriting be especially suitable and preferable to the direct and simple method of composition i shall describe two of them apart from their suitability for the dialogue form they be utterly unalike though it will turn out that one big topic include both any point of doctrine that be so obvious that it can hardly be question but at the same time so important that it deserve to be teach repeatedly seem to require some such method of handle it in a dialogue the novelty of the manner of presentation may make up for the triteness of the subject and the liveliness of the conversation may reinforce the teach also the variety of different angle from which the character in the dialogue approach the subject may appear neither tedious nor redundant on the other hand any question of philosophy that be so obscure and uncertain that human reason cant reach a secure conclusion about it seem to lead us naturally into the style of dialogue and conversation reasonable men may be allow to differ on a topic regard which noone can reasonably be confident and oppose view even without any decision as to which be right provide an agreeable way of pass the time and if the subject be challenge and interest the dialogue put us in a way into the company of the character in it thus a dialogue can unite the two greatest and purest pleasures of human life study and the company of others fortunately all those feature be to be find in the subject of natural religion what truth be so obvious so certain as that there exist a god people in the most ignorant age have believe this and the most refine geniuses have work to produce new proof and arguments for it and what truth be so important as this it be the grind of all our hop the surest foundation of morality the firmest support of society and the only principle that ought never to be a moment absent from our thoughts and meditations but when we dig into this obvious and important truth we run into obscure question about the nature of that divine be his attribute his decree his plan of providence men have always disagree about these matter and human reason hasnt definitely settle them but these topics be so important that we cant restrain our restless enquiry into them even though our most accurate research have yield nothing but doubt uncertainty and contradiction i recently have a chance to observe thisthat be the suitability of natural religion as a theme for dialoguewhen i be spend part of the summer season with cleanthes as i usually do and be present at the conversations he have with philo and demeathe ones i recently sketch to you my sketch make you so curious to know more you say that i cant forbear to give you a more detail report on their reason and to display the various systems that they defend relate to this delicate subject of natural religion the character of the three men be remarkably different and this raise your expectations even higher you contrast the careful philosophical methods of cleanthes with the casual scepticism of philo and contrast each of those with the rigid inflexible orthodoxy of demea be young i listen but didnt speak and my intense youthful interest in the whole conversation imprint on my memory the whole chain and connection of their arguments i hope and think that my account of the conversation wont omit or muddle any considerable part of it after i join the group whom i find sit in cleanthes library demea pay cleanthes some compliment on the great care he take of my education and on his unwearied perseverance and constancy in all his friendships pamphiluss father he say be your intimate friend the son be your pupil and we might think him to be your adopt son if we judge by the trouble you take in bring to him every useful branch of literature and science i be sure that you be as prudent as you be hardworking so i shall tell you a maxim that i have follow with regard to my own children want to know how far it agree with your upbringing of pamphilus the method i follow in the education of my children be base on the say of an ancient students of philosophy ought first to learn logic then ethics next physics last of all the nature of the gods because this science of natural theology be the most profound and abstruse of any he hold students of it need mature judgment and it cant safely be entrust to a mind that isnt already enrich with all the other sciences in this work science mean something like systematic discipline theoretical treatment it cover more than science do today do you leave it as late as that philo ask to teach your children the principles of religion isnt there a risk that they will neglect or even outright reject those religious view of which they have hear so little during the whole of their education demea reply i postpone the study of natural theology as a science that be open to human reason and controversy but only as a science my chief concern with my children be to bring piety into their mind while they be young by continual teach and also by example i hope i imprint deeply on their young mind a habitual reverence for all the principles of religion while they pass through every other branch of knowledge i comment on the uncertainty of each branch on the eternal controversies of men on the obscurity of all philosophy and on the strange ridiculous conclusions that some of the greatest geniuses have derive from the principles of mere human reason have thus tame their mind to a proper submission and distrust of their own abilities i no longer hesitate to open to them the greatest mysteries of religion and i see no risk that the presumptuous arrogance of philosophy will lead them to reject the most establish doctrines and opinions your precaution of bring piety into your childrens mind early on say philo be certainly very reasonable it be indeed need in this profane and irreligious age but what i admire most in your plan of education be your way of get advantage from the very principles of philosophy and learn which by inspire pride and selfsufficiency have often throughout the centuries be find to be so destructive to the principles of religion they be not so with everyone admittedly common folk with no experience of science and profound enquiry when they see how learn people be endlessly dispute often have a thorough contempt for philosophy and that make them hold even more firmly to the great point of theology that they have be teach people who enter a little way into study and enquiry think they find evidence to support new and extraordinary doctrines come to think that nothing be too difficult for human reason and presumptuously break through all fence and profane the holiest place in the temple our best protection against such arrogance in religious matter be ignorance but after we have abandon that we still haveas i hope cleanthes will agreeone way remain to us to prevent this profane liberty of lay down the law in religious matter what we should do be to adopt improve and cultivate versions of demeas principles concern our proneness to error and confusion let us become thoroughly aware of the weakness blindness and narrowness of human reason pay proper attention to its uncertainty and its endless contradictions even in ordinary everyday subject let the errors and deceits of our sense be keep in mind the insuperable difficulties surround the basic principles of every intellectual system the contradictions involve in the very ideas of matter cause and effect extension space time motionin short all kinds of ideas of quantity of all kinds though quantity be the topic of mathematics the only science that have any claim to certainty or selfevidence when these topics be display in their full light as they be by some philosophers and almost all religious writers who can remain confident enough of his frail reason to give heed to anything it tell him on topics that be so sublime so abstruse and so remote from common life and experience as the existence and nature of god when we realize that really familiar thingslike the holdingtogether of the part of a stone or even the structure of it that make it an extend thingare so inexplicable and involve such contradictions how confidently can we reach conclusions about the origin of worlds or trace their history from eternity to eternity as philo speak i notice that both demea and cleanthes be smile demeas smile seem to express total satisfaction with what philo be say but in cleanthes feature i discern an air of know amusement as though he saw in philos reason some kind of tease or trapsetting you propose then philo say cleanthes to erect religious faith on a basis of philosophical scepticism and you think that if certainty be expel from every other subject of enquiry it will retreat into these theological doctrines where it will be stronger and more authoritative than ever whether your scepticism be as absolute and sincere as you claim be something we shall learn later on when we end this little meet well see then whether you leave the room through the door or the window and whether you really doubt that your body have gravity and can be injure by its fallwhich be what people in general think on the basis of their fallacious sense and more fallacious experience and i think that this consideration of the test of scepticism in everyday life can fairly serve to make us less angry with this whimsical sect of the sceptics if they be wholly sincere they wont trouble the world for much longer with their doubt niggle and dispute and if they be only joke they may perhaps be bad comedians but they can never be very dangerous to the state to philosophy or to religion in reality philo he go on it seem certain that even if a man entirely renounce all beliefs and opinions do this in a rush of blood to the head after intense think about the contradictions and imperfections of human reason he cant persevere in this total scepticism or make it show in his conduct for more than a short time external object will press in on him his passions will call to him his philosophical gloom will dissipate and he wont be able to preserve his poor appearance of scepticismhowever hard he work on himself to do so and what reason have he to work on himself in that way hell never be able to answer that question satisfactorily consistently with his sceptical principles so that on the whole nothing could be more ridiculous than the principles of the ancient pyrrhonians extreme sceptics if they really do tryas it have be claim that they didto apply to the whole of life the same scepticism that they learn from classroom lecture which be where they ought to have confine it from this angle the stoics seem to be very like their perpetual antagonists the pyrrhonians each sect seem to be base on this erroneous maxim what a man can do sometimes and in some moods he can do always and in every mood when stoical reflections raise the mind into a frenzy of virtue and impress it with a sense of some kind of honour or public good extreme bodily pain and suffer wont prevail over such a high sense of duty and it may even be possible for someone to smile and rejoice in the middle of be torture if this sometimes actually happen how much more can a philosopher in his classroom or study work himself up to such a frenzy and imagine himself bear the acutest pain he can conceive but how be he to maintain the frenzy itself his frame of mind relax and he can not brace it up again just by want to do so other activities lead him astray misfortunes attack him unawares and the philosopher gradually sink into be an ordinary person i accept your comparison between the stoics and sceptics reply philo still although the stoic mind cant maintain the highest flight of philosophy even when it sink lower it still retain something of its former disposition and the effect of the stoics reason will appear in his conduct in everyday life flavour all of his action the ancient school of philosophy particularly that of zeno produce examples of virtue and steadfastness which seem astonish to us today vain wisdom all and false philosophy yet with a please sorcery could charm pain for a while or anguish and excite fallacious hope or arm the obdurate breast with stubborn patience as with triple steel milton paradise lose ii similarly if a man have accustom himself to sceptical thoughts about the uncertainty and narrowness of reason he wont entirely forget them when he turn his think onto other subject in all his philosophical principles and reasoningthough i darent say in his everyday conducthe will be find to be different from those who never form any opinions on this topic and from those who have think about it and take a more favourable view of human reason in this paragraph philo use philosophy to mean philosophy or science apparently with his eye mainly on science for ease of read philosophy and its cognates be replace by science and its cognates throughout the paragraph however far anyone push his speculative principles of scepticism he musti admitact and live and talk like other men but the only reason he need to give for this conduct be that it be absolutely necessary for him behave thus if he go further in this direction than he need to for sheer survival and engage in scientific enquiries into various nonhuman and human subject this doesnt show that he be insincere in his scepticism because his reason for this scientific theorize be just that he be draw to it by a certain pleasure and satisfaction that he find in employ himself in that way hes also aware that everyone even in common life be force to conduct himself in greater or lesser degree like a scientist that from our earliest infancy we make continual advance in form more general principles of conduct and reason that as our experience widen and our reason strengthen we make our principles more general and comprehensive and that what we call science be nothing but a more regular and methodical process of the same kind to engage in scientific enquiry into such subject be essentially the same as reason about common life and we may only expect greater stability if not greater truth from our science on account of its more exact and careful method of proceed but when we look beyond human affairs and the properties of the material things around uswhen we carry our speculations into the two eternities before and after the present state of things the creation and formation of the universe the existence and properties of spirit the power and operations of one universal spirit exist without begin and without end omnipotent omniscient unchanging infinite and incomprehensible when we consider any of this we would have to be very unsceptical not to worry that we have here go quite beyond the reach of our faculties so long as we confine our theorize to trade or morals or politics or criticism we make continual appeal to common sense and experience these appeal strengthen our philosophical and scientific conclusions and at least partly remove the suspicion that we rightly have regard any reason that be very subtle and delicate but in theological reason we dont have this advantage of be able to appeal to common experience just when we have most need of it while we be think about object whichwe must be awareare too large for our grasp and need more than any others to be present to our mind in a way that will make them familiar to us we be like foreigners in a strange country to whom everything must seem suspicious and who be in danger every moment of break the laws and customs of the people with whom they live and talk we dont know how far we ought to trust our ordinary vulgar methods of reason in such a theological subject because even in everyday lifein the area that be specially suit to themwe cant explain or justify them and be entirely guide by a kind of instinct or necessity in employ them all sceptics claim that if reason be consider abstractly it provide invincible arguments against itself and that we could never retain any opinion or confidence on any subject if it be not that the sceptical reason in which reason discredit itself be so refine and subtle that they cant outweigh the more solid and more natural arguments derive from the sense and experience but it be obvious that when our arguments lose this advantage of solidity and naturalness and run wide of everyday life the most refine scepticism come to be on an equal foot with them and can oppose and counterbalance them neither side have more weight than the other the mind must remain suspend between them and that suspense or balance be the triumph of scepticism but i observe with regard to you philo and to all theoretical sceptics say cleanthes that your doctrine be at odds with your behaviourjust as much in the most abstruse point of theory as in the conduct of everyday life wherever evidence be find you adhere to it despite your suppose scepticism and i can observe too that some of your fellowsceptics be as decisive as those who claim higher level of certainty and assurance really wouldnt it be ridiculous for someone to say that he reject newtons explanation of the wonderful phenomenon of the rainbow because that explanation give a minute anatomy of the ray of lighta subject say this absurd sceptic too refine for human comprehension and what would you say to someone who find no fault with the arguments of copernicus and galileo for the motion of the earth nevertheless withhold his assent on the general grind that these subject be too magnificent and remote to be explain by the narrow and deceitful reason of mankind there be indeed a kind of crude and ignorant scepticism as you rightly remark that give common people a general prejudice against things they cant easily understand and make them reject every principle that require elaborate reason to prove and establish it this sort of scepticism be fatal to knowledge not to religion for we find that many of those who most strenuously profess it give their assent not only to the great truths of theism and natural theology but even to the most absurd doctrines that traditional superstition have recommend to them they firmly believe in witch though they refuse to believe or attend to the most simple proposition in euclids geometry but the refine and philosophical sceptics fall into an inconsistency of an opposite kind they push their research into the most abstruse corner of science and at every step they accept proposition in proportion to the evidence for them that they meet with they be even oblige to admit that the most abstruse and remote object be the ones that be best explain by science light be in reality anatomize the true system of the heavenly body be discover but the nourishment of body by food be still a mystery that we cant explain the hold together of the part of matter be still incomprehensible light be abstruse and the heavenly body be remote but nourishment and the firmness of pebbles be neither so the refine sceptics can not draw a general line in those term these sceptics therefore be oblige in every enquiry to consider each particular bite of evidence separately and to proportion their assent to the precise strength of the evidence they find this be what they actually do in all natural mathematical moral and political science and why not the same i ask in theological and religious study why should we confine to them the practice of reject conclusions without look into the evidence that have be offer on the general grind that human reason be insufficient isnt this discriminatory attitude a plain proof of prejudice and passion our sense you say be fallacious our understand be erroneous our ideaseven of the most familiar object extension duration motionare full of absurdities and contradictions you defy me to solve the difficulties or reconcile the inconsistencies that you find in them i havent the skill for so great an undertake i havent leisure for it i see that theres no need for it your own conduct in every circumstance refute your principles and show the firmest reliance on all the receive maxims of science morals prudence and behaviour i shall never accept the celebrate arnaulds extravagant statement that the sceptics be not a sect of philosophers only a sect of liars but i will sayno offence meantthat they be a sect of comedians or teasers for my part though whenever i find myself want fun and amusement i shall certainly choose for my entertainment something less puzzle and abstruse than sceptical philosophy a comedy a novel or at most a history seem a more natural recreation than such metaphysical subtleties and abstractions it be no use for the sceptic to distinguish science from common life or one science from another the arguments that he use if they be sound hold good in each of these areas and have just as much force in one as in another or if there be any difference among them the advantage lie entirely on the side of theology and natural religionthe advantage that be of have the strength to resist scepticism many principles of mechanics be base on very abstruse reason yet nobody with any degree of scientific competence claim to be in the least doubt concern to themnor indeed do any theoretical sceptic the copernican system contain the thesis that the sun doesnt go around the earth which be the most surprise paradox and the one most contrary to our natural conceptions to appearances and to our very sense yet even monks and inquisitors have have to withdraw their opposition to it then we have the religious hypothesis which be base on the simplest and most obvious arguments and be easily accept by the mind of man unless it be block by artificial obstacles will philo a thoughtful and knowledgeable man cast doubt on it because of the suppose unreliability of the human faculties in general with no special reference to the religious hypothesis in particular and here we may observe he go on turn towards demea a rather curious fact in the history of the sciences after philosophy be join to the religion of the people when christianity be first establish religious teachers commonly denounce reason the sense and every principle derive merely from human research and enquiry the father of the church take up all the theme of the ancient academics here sceptics which then spread from them down the years into every school and pulpit in christendom the reformers embrace the same principles of reason or rather denunciation and all flowery praise of the excellency of faith be sure to be spice with some cut jib against natural reason a celebrate roman catholic bishop too a man of the most extensive learn who write a demonstration of christianity have also write a book contain all the faultfinding of the boldest and most determine pyrrhonism it take centuries for this contempt for reason to die down locke seem to have be the first christian to risk say openly that faith be nothing but a species of reason that religion be only a branch of philosophy and that the arguments that have always be use in discover all the principles of theology natural and reveal be just like those that have be use to establish truths in morals politics or physics the miserable use that bayle and other freethinkers make of the philosophical scepticism of the church father and first reformersnamely their use of it as a weapon against religionhad the effect of widen the acceptance of lock sensible opinion and now all those who claim to be thinkers assert in a way that atheist and sceptic be almost synonymous and just as it be certain that no man would sincerely declare himself a sceptic i venture to hope that there be as few who seriously maintain atheism dont you remember say philo the excellent say of lord bacon on this topic that a little philosophy reply cleanthes make a man an atheist a great deal convert him to religion thats a very sensible remark too say philo but what i have in mind be another passage where have mention davids fool who say in his heart that there be no god this great philosopher observe that the atheists nowadays be double fool for they arent content to say in their hearts that there be no god but also utter that impiety with their lips which make them guilty of multiply indiscretion and imprudence such people however serious and sincere they be can not be much of a threat i think but even at the risk of your count me as one of this class of fool i cant forbear to say something that occur to me arise out of the history of religious and irreligious scepticism with which you have entertain us it seem to me that there be strong symptoms of priestcraft in that whole course of events during ignorant age such as those follow the abolition of the ancient school the priests saw that atheism deism a thin belief in a higher power not necessarily a personal one or heresy of any kind could only come from the presumptuous question of common opinions and from the belief that human reason be equal to every task in those time education have a great influence over the mind of men and be almost equal in power to the suggestions of the sense and common understand by which the most determine sceptic must admit that he be govern but these days when education have much less influence and mens increase contact throughout the world have teach them to compare the principles that be accept in different nations and age our cunning divine have change their whole system of philosophy and talk the language of stoics platonists and aristotelians not that of pyrrhonians and academics if we distrust human reason we have now no other principle to lead us into religion these reverend gentlemen can be depend on to identify the system that best suit their purpose of keep an ascendancy over mankindit may be scepticism in one age dogmatism in anotherand make it their favourite principle and establish doctrine it be very natural say cleanthes for men to embrace the principles by which they find they can best defend their doctrines we can account for this reasonable behaviour without drag priestcraft into the story and surely nothing can afford a stronger support for the truth of a set of principles than to observe that they tend to confirm true religion and serve to silence the complaints of atheists libertines and freethinkers of all kinds i must admit cleanthes say demea that nothing could surprise me more than the light in which you have all along put this argument by the whole trend and tone of your remark one would think you be maintain the existence of a god against the objections of atheists and infidels and that you felt a need to stand up for that fundamental principle of all religion but i hope there be no question here about the existence of a god i be sure that no manor anyway no man of common senseever have a serious doubt regard such a certain and selfevident truth the question be not about the existence but about the nature of god because of the infirmities of human understand i contend the nature of god be entirely incomprehensible and unknown to us the essence of that supreme mind his attribute his way of exist his way of last through timeall these be mysterious to men as be everything else concern such a divine be finite weak and blind creatures such as we be ought to humble ourselves in his august presence and conscious of our frailties stand in silent wonder at his infinite perfections which eye have not see ear have not hear neither have it enter into the heart of man to conceive they be hide from human curiosity by a deep cloud it be insult to god to try to penetrate these sacred obscurities the audacity of pry into gods nature and essence his decree and attribute be second only to the impiety of deny his existence lest you should think that my piety have here overpower my philosophy i shall support my opinionif it need any supportby a very great authority i could cite in my support almost any writer since the foundation of christianity who have ever treat this or any other theological subject but for now i shall confine myself to just one who be equally famous for piety and philosophy it be father malebranche whom i remember as express himself thus one ought to call god a spirit not so much to express positively what he be as to signify that he be not matter he be an infinitely perfect be this we can not doubt but just as we oughtnt to imagine even suppose him corporeal that he have a human body as the anthropomorphites assert on the ground that the human shape be the most perfect of any so we oughtnt to imagine that the spirit of god have human ideas or bear any resemblance to our spirit on the ground that we know nothing more perfect than a human mind we ought rather to believe that just as he include within himself the perfections of matter without be material he include within himself also the perfections of create spirit without be spirit accord to our conception of spirit we ought to believe that his true name be he that be or in other word be without restriction all be the be infinite and universal after so great an authority as that demea reply philo and a thousand more that you could produce it would appear ridiculous in me to add my own view or express my approval of your doctrine but surely when reasonable men discuss these subject their topic be never the existence of god but only his nature that he exist be as you well observe unquestionable and selfevident nothing exist without a cause and the original cause of this universe whatever it may be we call god and piously ascribe to him every kind of perfection whoever question this fundamental truth deserve every punishment that philosophers can inflict on one another namely the greatest ridicule contempt and disapproval but all perfection be entirely relative so we ought never to imagine that we understand the attribute of this divine be or to suppose that his perfections be in any way analogous or similar to the perfections of a human creature wisdom think design knowledgeit be proper for us to ascribe these to him because those word be honourable among men and we have no other language or other conceptions by which to express our wonder at his glory but let us be careful not to think that our ideas of wisdom think etc in any way correspond to his perfections or that his attribute have any resemblance to these qualities of men he be infinitely superior to our restrict view and limit understand and be more the object of worship in the temple than of debate in the school in reality cleanthes he go on we can arrive at this position without help from the pretendscepticism that you so dislike here be how our ideas reach no further than our experience we have no experience of divine attribute and operations i neednt conclude my syllogism you can draw the inference yourself and it be a pleasure to me and i hope to you too that valid reason and sound piety here work together to the same conclusion and both of them establish the wondrously mysterious and incomprehensible nature of the supreme be i shant beat about the bush say cleanthes address himself to demea still less shall i reply to philos pious speeches what i shall do be to explain briefly how i conceive this matter look round the world contemplate the whole thing and every part of it youll find that it be nothing but one big machine subdivide into an infinite number of smaller ones which in their turn could be subdivide to a degree beyond what human sense and faculties can trace and explain all these various machine and even their most minute part be adjust to each other so precisely that everyone who have ever contemplate them be fill with wonder the intricate fit of mean to end throughout all nature be just like though more wonderful than the fit of mean to end in things that have be produce by usproducts of human design think wisdom and intelligence since the effect resemble each other we be lead to infer by all the rule of analogy that the cause be also alike and that the author of nature be somewhat similar to the mind of man though he have much larger faculties to go with the grandeur of the work he have carry out by this argument a posteriori and by this argument alone do we prove both that there be a god and that he resemble human mind and intelligence i have to tell you cleanthes say demea that from the begin i could not approve of your conclusion about the similarity of god to men still less can i approve of your ways of try to establish it what no demonstration that god exist no abstract arguments no a priori proof an a priori argument be one that proceed by sheer think make no use of contingent facts about what the world be like an argument that do appeal to such facts be call a posteriori which be what cleanthes say that his argument be what about the ones that have in the past be so much insist on by philosophersare they all fallacious all mere trick do experience and probability mark the limit to how far we can go in this subject i wont say that this be betray the cause of a god but surely by this show of evenhandedness you provide atheists with advantage that they could never have obtain purely through argument and reason my main reservation about what cleanthes have say philo remark be not so much that he base all religious arguments on experience as that his arguments seem not to be the most certain and unbreakable even of that inferior experiencebased kind that a stone will fall that fire will burn that the earth have solidity we have observe thousands of time and when any new instance of this sort be present we dont hesitate to draw the usual conclusion this stone will fall this fire will burn the earth that i be about to put my right foot on be solid the exact similarity of the case give us a perfect assurance of a similar outcome and we never want or look for stronger evidence than that but the evidence be less strong when the case be less than perfectly alike any reduction in similarity however tiny bring a correspond reduction in the strength of the evidence and as we move down that scale we may eventually reach a very weak analogy lead to a conclusion that be confessedly liable to error and uncertainty after have observe the circulation of the blood in human creatures we have no doubt that it circulate in titius and maevius but from its circulation in frog and fish it be only a presumptionthough a strong one from analogythat blood circulate in men and other animals the analogical reason be even weaker when we infer the circulation of the sap in plant from our experience that the blood circulate in animals and those who hastily follow that imperfect analogy between plant and animals have be find by more accurate experiment to have be mistake if we see a house cleanthes we conclude with the greatest certainty that it have an architect or builder because this be precisely the kind of effect that we have experience as come from that kind of cause but surely you wont say that the universe be so like a house that we can with the same certainty infer a similar cause or that the analogy be here entire and perfect the unlikeness in this case be so strike that the most you can offer on the basis of it be a guess a conjecture a presumption about a similar cause and i leave it to you to consider how that offer will be receive in the world if i grant that the proof of the existence of a god amount to no more than a guess or conjecture reply cleanthes that wouldnt be well receive and i would deservedly be blame and detest but be it such a slight resemblance between how mean be fit to end in a house and how they be fit in the universe the way things be fit to their purpose the order proportion and arrangement of every part step of a staircase be plainly design so that human legs can use them in climb and this inference from how the step can be use to their purpose be certain and infallible human legs be also design for walk and climb and this inference from how legs can be use to their purpose i admit be not quite so certain because of the dissimilarity you have point out but do that downgrade it to mere presumption or conjecture good god exclaim demea interrupt him what have we come to earnest defenders of religion admit that the proof of a god fall short of be perfectly evident and you philo whose help i depend on in prove the worshipful mysteriousness of gods naturedo you assent to all these extreme opinions of cleanthes for how else can i describe them and why should i tone down my criticism when such principles be advance support by such an authority as cleanthes in the presence of such a young man as pamphilus you seem not to grasp reply philo that i argue with cleanthes in his own way i hope that by show him the dangerous consequences of his view i shall finally bring him to share our opinion but what bother you most i notice be cleanthes account of the argument a posteriori you find that that argument in his version of it be likely to slip out of your grasp and vanish into thin air you think cleanthes have so disguise it that you can hardly believe he have present it properly now however much i may disagree in other ways with the dangerous principles of cleanthes i must admit that he have fairly present that argument and i shall try to set it out for you in such a way that you will no longer view it with suspicion if a man be to set aside everything he know or have see he would be entirely unable to work out merely from his own ideas what the universe must be like or to think one state of affairs to be more likely than another nothing that he clearly conceive could be think to be impossible or to imply a contradiction so every fanciful story his imagination come up with would be on an equal foot with every other and he could give no valid reason for stick to one idea or system and reject the others that be equally possible next step in the argument after he open his eye and see the world as it really be he cant at first tell what the cause be of any one event much less of the totality of things or of the universe he might start his imagination ramble and it might bring in to him an infinite variety of report and stories these would all be possible but because they would all be equally possible he could never from his own resources explain satisfactorily why he prefer one of them to the rest experience alone can point out to him the true cause of anything that happen now demea this method of reason lead to something that cleanthes himself have tacitly admit namely order arrangement or the suitability of things for various purpose like the suitability of legs for walk be not of itself any proof that a designer have be at work except in case where experience have show us that such order arrangement etc be due to a designer for all we can know a priori matter may have a source of order within it just as mind do have it inherently basically not acquire from somewhere else the interpolation in this next bite be longer than most to make it easier to recognize it be flag by asterisk rather than small dot when a number of elements come together in an exquisite arrangement you may think it harder to conceive that they do this of their own accord than to conceive that some designer put them into that arrangement but that be too quick and careless think about what be involve in a designers arrange them it mean that he create the arrangement in his mind assemble in the appropriate way the ideas of the elements in question but then how do that happen i put it to you it be no harder to conceive that the elements be cause to come together into this arrangement by some unknown cause that be internal to them than it be to conceive that the ideas of these elements come together in that arrangement in the great universal mind be cause to do so by a similarly unknown cause that be internal to that mind these two suppositions be agree to be equally possible but accord to cleanthes experience show us a difference between them throw several piece of steel together without shape or form they will never arrange themselves so as to compose a watch stone and mortar and wood without an architect never erect a house but we see that the ideas in a human mind arrange themselves so as to form the plan of a watch or house though we havent the faintest notion of how they do this so experience show that mindsand not matterhave a builtin principle of order from similar effect we infer similar cause the way mean be fit to end in the universe at large be like the way mean be fit to end in a machine design by a human be the cause of the machine therefore must be similar to the cause of the universe i be i admit shock by this assertion of a resemblance between god and human creatures i cant help see it as imply such a lower of the supreme be that no rightthinking theist could put up with it with your assistance therefore demea i shall try to defend what you justly call the worshipful mysteriousness of gods nature and shall refute this reason of cleanthes provide he agree that i have present it fairly when cleanthes have agree to this philo after a short pause proceed in the follow manner in the meantime i shant disagree much with your theses that all inferences concern matter of fact be base on experience and that all experimental reason be base on the supposition that similar cause prove similar effect and similar effect prove similar cause but please notice how extremely cautious good thinkers be in transfer a discover result to a similar case these thinkers be not perfectly confident in apply their past observation to some other particular phenomenon unless the old and new case be exactly similar every alteration in the circumstances of the cause raise a doubt about the outcome and it require new experiment to prove for sure that the new circumstances have no causal significance a change in size position arrangement age disposition of the air or of surround bodiesany of these may bring with it the most unexpected consequences unless the object be quite familiar to us it be much too bold to expect confidently that when a cause have be find to have a certain effect another cause differ from the earlier one in one of these ways will have the same effect the slow and deliberate step of scientists here if anywhere be in contrast with the precipitate march of common men who hurry along by the smallest similarity be incapable of ponder or make distinctions which group cleanthes have you just show yourself to belong to you be usually cool and philosophical in these matter but have your usual attitude be preserve in the stride you have take in liken the universe to house ship furniture and machine infer from their similarity in some respect a similarity in their cause think design intelligence such as we discover in men and other animals be just one of the spring and force of the universe along with heat and cold attraction and repulsion and a hundred others that we observe daily it be an active cause through which we find certain particular part of nature produce alterations in other part but can it be proper to argue from part to the whole doesnt the great disproportion between part and whole bar all comparison and inference from observe the growth of a hair can we learn anything about how men come into be would the way a leaf blowseven if we know this perfectlyteach us anything about how a tree grow anyway even if we do take the operations of one part of nature on another as our basis for a judgment about the origin of the whole which be something we should never do why would we select as our basis such a tiny weak limit cause as the reason and design of animals on this planet seem to be this little agitation of the brain that we call thoughtwhat special privilege do it have that entitle it to serve as the model of the whole universe it loom large for us because we be always in the presence of it but sound philosophy ought carefully to guard against this kind of natural illusion so far from admit continue philo that the operations of a part entitle us to draw any conclusion about the origin of the whole i wont even allow any one part to justify conclusions about another part if the two be very unlike one another be there any reasonable grind to conclude that the inhabitants of other planets have think intelligence reason or anything similar to these faculties that men have when nature have operate in such a wide variety of ways on this small planet can we think that she incessantly copy herself throughout the rest of this immense universe also it seem likely enough that think occur only in this narrow corner and even here its sphere of action be very limitednamely to affect the movements of the body of some animals so what can justify take think to be the original cause of everything such a jump be worse than that of a peasant whose idea of the government of kingdoms be base on how he run his own household but even if we be perfectly sure that think and reason similar to ours be to be find throughout the whole universe and even if its activity elsewhere in the universe be vastly greater in scope and more powerful than it appear to be on this planet still i can not see that the operations of a world that be fully constitute arrange and adjust can properly be extend to a world that be in its embryo state and be still move towards that finish constitution and arrangement by observation we know a certain amount about how a finish animal move be nourish stay alive but we should be cautious about transfer that knowledge speculatively to the growth of a foetus in the womb and still more to the formation of an animalcule in the testes of its male parent animalcule tiny animal it be commonly think that the animal be form in miniature in the father body the mother contribution be merely to provide it with somewhere to grow even our limit experience show us that nature have an infinite number of cause and principles which incessantly reveal themselves as circumstances change it would be absurdly rash of us to claim to know what new and unknown principles would be at work in such a new and unknown situation as that of the formation of a universe a very small part of this great system of the universe during a very short time be very imperfectly reveal to us do we then pronounce confidently about the origin of the whole admirable conclusion at this time on this little planet stone wood brick iron brass be not order or arrange except through human artifice and contrivance therefore the universe couldnt originally attain its order and arrangement without something similar to human artifice but be one part of nature a rule for another part that be very different from it be it a rule for the whole be a very small part a rule for the universe be nature in one situation a certain rule for nature in another situation vastly different from the former be nature at work in our considerably develop universe a certain rule for nature at work in start a universe and can you blame me cleanthes if i here imitate the wise caution of simonides accord to the famous story hiero ask him what be god and simonides ask for a day to think about it and then two days more and in that way he continually prolong his time for think about it without ever produce a definition or description could you even blame me if i answer straight off that i didnt know what god be and be aware that this subject lie vastly beyond the reach of my faculties you might cry sceptic and tease as much as you please but have find the imperfections and even contradictions of human reason when it be exercise on so many other subject that be much more familiar than this one i would never expect any success from reason feeble conjecture concern a subject that be so elevate and so remote from the sphere of our observation when two sort of object have always be observe to be conjoin together custom lead me to infer the existence of an object of one sort wherever i see the existence of an object of the other sort and i call this an argument from experience but it be hard to see how this pattern of argument can be appropriate in our present case where the object we be consider dont fall into sort but be single individual without parallel or specific resemblance and will anyone tell me with a straight face that an orderly universe must arise from some think and artifice like human think and artifice because we have experience of it to make this reason secure we would need to have have experience of the origins of worlds it isnt sufficient surely to have see ship and cities arise from human artifice and contrivance philo be go on in this vigorous manner somewhere between joke and seriousness it seem to me when he notice sign of impatience in cleanthes and immediately stop what i want to cut in with say cleanthes be only the suggestion that you stop abuse term use common everyday expressions to subvert philosophical reason you know that common people often distinguish reason from experience even where the question relate only to a matter of fact and existence though it be find that where that kind of reason be properly analyse it turn out to be nothing but a sort of experience to prove by experience that the universe be originate by a mind be no more contrary to common speech than to prove by experience that the earth move a faultfinder could raise against the copernican system all the objections that you have urge against my reason have you other earth he might say which you have see to move have yes interrupt philo we do have other earth isnt the moon another earth which we see to turn round its centre isnt venus another earth where we see the same thing arent the revolutions of the sun also a confirmation through analogyof the same theory arent all the planets that revolve around the sun earth arent the satellite of jupiter and saturn moon that move around the sun along with their primary planets these analogies and resemblancesand others that i havent mentionedare the only evidence for the copernican system it be for you to consider whether you have any analogies of the same kind to support your theory in reality cleanthes he go on the modern system of astronomy be now so thoroughly accept by all enquirers and have become such an essential a part of the education even of small children that we be often not very scrupulous about examine the reason for it it be now become a matter of mere scholarly curiosity to study the first writers on that subjectthe ones who have the full force of prejudice against them and have to present their arguments in every possible light in order to render them popular and convince but if we peruse galileos famous dialogues concern the system of the world we shall find that that great geniusone of the greatest who ever existedfirst put all his efforts into prove that there be no basis for the distinction commonly make between elementary and celestial substances the aristotelian scientists rely on sensory illusions have make a great deal of this distinction they have lay it down that celestial substances can not be generate alter or in any way affect and they have assign all the opposite qualities to elementary substances but galileo begin with the moon prove its similarity in every detail to the earthits convex shape its natural darkness when not illuminate by the sun its density its distinction into solid and liquid the variations of its phase the mutual illuminations of the earth and moon their mutual eclipse the unevenness of the moon surface and so on after many examples of this kind relate to all the planets men saw that these body be proper object of experience and that their similarity to one another entitle us to extend the same arguments and phenomena from one to another this cautious proceed of the astronomers implicitly condemn your argument cleanthes or rather it point to the fact that the subject on which you be engage exceed all human reason and enquiry can you claim to show any such similarity between the structure of a house and the generation of a universe have you ever see nature in a situation that resemble the first arrangement of the elements at the begin of the universe have worlds ever be form under your eye and have you have leisure to observe the whole progress of worldmaking from the first appearance of order to its final consummation if you have then cite your experience and deliver your theory in the hand of an ingenious and inventive person reply cleanthes even the most absurd argument can be make to seem plausible dont you realize philo that copernicus and his first disciples have to prove the similarity of terrestrial to celestial matter because various scientistsblinded by old systems and support by some empirical evidencehad deny that similarity but that theists dont in the same way have to prove the similarity of the work of nature to those of human artifice because this similarity be selfevident and undeniable the work of nature be make of the same stuff as be human artifacts and the two be alike in form also what more be need to show an analogy between their cause and to show that the origin of all things be a divine purpose and intention your objections to put it bluntly be no better than the elaborate arguments use by the philosophers who deny that anything move and they ought to be refute in the same way as those by illustrations examples and instance rather than by serious argument and philosophy that be how i shall oppose your arguments suppose that an articulate voice be hear in the cloud much louder and more melodious than any human voice could ever be suppose further that this voice be hear at the same time in all nations and that it speak to each nation in its own language and dialect suppose finally that the word speak from the sky be not only meaningful but convey some instruction that be altogether worthy of a benevolent be who be superior to mankind if all that occur could you possibly hesitate for a moment over the cause of this voice wouldnt you be compel to ascribe it straight off to some design or purpose yet if you do come to that conclusion your inference would be open to all the same objections if they deserve such a label that be bring against the system of theism heres the position you seem to be commit to all conclusions about matter of fact be base on experience when we hear an articulate voice in the dark and infer that a man have speak it be only the resemblance of the effect which lead us to conclude that there be a similar resemblance in the cause but this extraordinary voice from the sky be loud and wideranging and flexible as to languages which no human voice be so we have no reason to suppose its cause be like the cause of human speech so this rational wise coherent speech come from we know not whereperhaps an accidental whistle of the windsand not from any divine reason or intelligence you can see clearly your own objections in these objections and i hope you also see clearly that one lot be no better than the other but to bring the case still nearer our present topic of the universe i shall make two suppositions whichthough they be weird and not truedont involve any absurdity or impossibility suppose that there be a natural universal invariable language common to every individual of the human race and that book be natural products which perpetuate themselves in the same way as animals and plant do by descent and propagation these suppositions arent as wildly far from fact as you might think we do have a kind of universal language embed in some expressions of our passions and all the lower animals have a natural speech which however limit be very intelligible to their own species and as the finest and most eloquent text be infinitely less complex and intricate than the coarsest organism the propagation of an iliad or aeneid be easier to suppose than that of any plant or animal well now suppose you enter your library the shelve of which be full of natural volumes contain the most refine reason and most exquisite beauty could you possibly open one of them and doubt that its original cause bore the strongest analogy to mind and intelligence when it reason and discourse when it expostulate argue and enforce its view and line of think when it appeal sometimes to the pure intellect sometimes to the feel when it take up every consideration suit to the subject decorate it and deal with it could you still say that all this basically have no mean and that think and plan have no role to play when this volume first come into be in the loins of its original parent i know you arent as obstinate as that even your irresponsible scepticism would be ashamed to assert such a glare absurdity furthermore philo if there be any difference between my two suppositions case and the real state of affairs in the universe it be the latter that suit my argument better the anatomy of an animal present many stronger instance of design than the read of livy or tacitus do and any objection which you start in the real world case demand that we attend to such an unusual and extraordinary scene as the first formation of worlds hold equally in the two suppositions case with its vegetate library so choose side philo without ambiguity or evasion either assert that a rational book neednt have a rational cause or admit a similar cause for all the work of nature let me add cleanthes go on that this religious argument instead of be weaken by the scepticism that you keep parade be actually strengthen by it become more firm and undisputed to reject all argument and reason be either affectation or madness every reasonable sceptic reject only argumentation that be abstruse remote and intricate stick to common sense and the plain instincts of nature and assent to things the reason for which strike him with so much force that it would take him an enormous effort not to assent now the arguments for natural religion be plainly of this forceful almost irresistible kind and nothing but the most perverse and obstinate metaphysics can reject them think about the anatomy of the eye consider its structure and design and then tell medoesnt the idea of a designer immediately come into your mind with a force like that of a sensation the most obvious conclusion surely be in favour of a designer and it require time reflection and study to bring to mind objectionswhich be frivolous although they be abstrusewhich can support atheism who can see the male and female of each species the fit between their body their instincts their passions and their whole course of life before and after generation without be aware that the propagation of the species be intend by nature millions and millions of such instance present themselves through every part of the universe and the intricate fit of things to their purpose convey an intelligible and obvious mean at least as well as do any language what level of blind dogmatism would you have to reach to reject such natural and convince arguments however you may carp at it the argument that liken an orderly world to a coherent articulate speech will still be accept as an incontestable proof of design and intention in the causation of the world if this argument for theism conflict with the principles of logic as you claim it do its irresistible power over nearly everyone clearly show that there may be arguments that be good although they break the rule dont dismiss this as special plead for we do sometimes accept rulebreaking performances as good even as excellent we sometimes encounter beauties in write that seem contrary to the rule and yet gain our affections and enliven our imaginations in opposition to all the literary doctrines and to the authority of the establish literary master it sometimes happen i admit that the religious arguments dont have the influence they should have on an ignorant savage and barbarian not because they be obscure and difficult but because the savage never ask himself any of the question on which they depend where do the intricate structure of an animal come from from the copulation of its parent and where do the parent come from from their parent repeat this a few time and the object come to be at such a distance from the savage that he lose them in darkness and confusion and he have no curiosity to trace them further but this be neither dogmatism nor scepticism but stupidity a state of mind very different from your closearguing questionraising disposition my ingenious friend you can trace cause from effect you can compare the most distant and remote object and your greatest errors proceed not from barrenness of think and invention but from too luxuriant a fertility which suppress your natural good sense by a profusion of unnecessary doubt and objections here i could observe that philo be a little embarrass and confuse but while he hesitate in give an answer demea break in on the conversationluckily for philo your example involve book and language he say to cleanthes get much of its force from be familiar but isnt there some danger in this very familiarity may it not lead us to get above ourselves by make us imagine we comprehend god and have some adequate idea of his nature and attribute when i read a book i enter into the mind and intention of the author at that moment i become him in a way and have an immediate feel and conception of the ideas that revolve in his imagination when he be write but we can never come as close as that to god his ways be not our ways his attribute be perfect but incomprehensible and his book of nature contain a great and inexplicable riddle more than any intelligible discourse or reason the ancient platonists you know be the most religious and devout of all the pagan philosophers yet many of them particularly plotinus expressly declare that intellect or understand be not to be ascribe to god and that our most perfect worship of him consist not in act of veneration reverence gratitude or love but rather in a certain mysterious selfannihilation or total extinction of all our faculties these ideas be perhaps too far stretch but still there be a truth bury in them it must be admit that by represent god as so intelligible and comprehensible and so similar to a human mind we be guilty of the grossest and most narrow selfcentredness make ourselves the model of the whole universe all the sentiments of the human mindgratitude resentment love friendship approval blame pity imitation envyclearly involve the state and situation of man and be calculate for preserve the existence and promote the activity of be like us in circumstances like ours so it seem unreasonable to transfer such sentiments to a supreme be or to suppose that he be move by them besides which the phenomena of the universe wont support us in such a theory all our ideas derive from the sense be confusedly false and deceptive and so cant be suppose to have a place in a supreme intelligence and the whole stock of the human understand consist of those together with the ideas of the external sense and we cant attribute the latter to god who be in no way passive and so doesnt have sense as we do we may conclude that none of the materials of think in the human intelligence be in any respect like those of the divine intelligence now as to the manner of think how can we make any comparison between them or suppose them to be in any way alike our think be fluctuate uncertain fleet successive and compound make up of little elements of think and these feature of it belong to its essence so that it would be an abuse of word to apply the name of think or reason to anything that wasnt fluctuate uncertain etc at least if it seem more pious and respectful as it really be still to use these word when we speak of the supreme be we should admit that their mean as apply to him be totally incomprehensible and that the weakness of our nature prevent us from have any ideas that correspond in the least to the ineffable sublimity of gods attribute it seem strange to me say cleanthes that you demea who be so sincere in the cause of religion should still maintain the mysterious incomprehensible nature of god and should insist so strenuously that he in no way resemble human creatures i freely admit that god have many power and attribute that we cant comprehend but if our ideas of him be not as far as they go true and adequate and in conformity with his real nature i dont know what remain that be worth discuss in this subject be the name without any mean of such vast importance and how do you mystics who maintain the absolute incomprehensibility of god differ from sceptics or atheists who assert that the first cause of everything be unknown and unintelligible they reject the view that the world be produce by a mind by which i mean a mind like the human one for i dont know of any other kind they must be very bold if they then go on to claim to know what other specific intelligible cause produce the world and if they dont make that claim and admit that the cause be unknown to them they must be very scrupulous indeed if they refuse to call the unknown cause of everything a god or deity and to bestow on him as many highflown praise and meaningless epithets as you may ask them to who could imagine reply demea that cleanthesthe calm philosophical cleantheswould attempt to refute his antagonists by stick a label on them namely the label mystic and like the common bigots and inquisitors of our time resort to invective and rhetoric instead of reason doesnt he realize that his kind of attack can go either way and that anthropomorphite be as damage and threaten a label bring as much danger with it as the epithet mystic with which he have honour me anthropomorphite come from greek mean humanshaped an anthropomorphite be someone who hold that god be like a man in reality cleanthes consider what you be say when you represent god as similar to a human mind and understand what be the mind of man it be make up of many different faculties passions sentiments and ideas they be indeed unite into one self or person but they be still distinct from each other when a man mind reason the ideas that be the part of its mental discourse arrange themselves in a certain form or order and this be not preserve intact for a moment but immediately make way for a new arrangement of ideas new opinions new passions new affections new feel arise which continually diversify the mental scene and produce in it the greatest variety and most rapid succession imaginable how be this compatible with that perfect unchangingness and simplicitysimplicity in the sense of not have partswhich all true theists ascribe to god accord to them he see past present and future in a single act his love and hatred his mercy and justice be one individual operation he be entirely present at every point in space and exist completely at every instant of time gods nature doesnt involve the slightest hint of difference or variation there be no sequence of events in him he doesnt change he doesnt gain or lose anything what he be now be what he have always be and always will be without any change in what he think feel or do he stand fix in one simple perfect state and it can never be correct to say that this act of his be different from that or that this judgment or idea be one that he have only recently and that it will in time be follow by some other judgment or idea i can readily allow say cleanthes that those who maintain that god be perfectly simple in the sense you have give to this and to the extent that you have just express be complete mystics and be guilty of all the consequences that i have derive from their opinion they be in a word atheists without know it for though we may grant that god have attribute that we can not understand still we ought never to ascribe to him any attribute that be absolutely incompatible with the think nature that be essential to him a mind whose act and feel and ideas be not distinct and successive a mind that be wholly simple and totally unchanging be a mind that have no think no reason no will no sentiment no love no hatred in short it isnt a mind at all it be an abuse of word to call it a mind on a par with speak of a region of space that have no shape or of number that isnt compose of smaller number think who your target be say philo you confer the title atheist on almost all the sound orthodox theologians who have treat this subject and you will end up find that by your criteria you be the only sound theist in the world but if idolaters be atheists as i think they can fairly be say to be and if christian theologians be also atheists as you have imply what be leave of the famous argument for theism from the universal consent of mankind but i know that name and authorities dont carry much weight with you so ill try to show you a little more clearly the drawbacks of that anthropomorphism that you have embrace and i shall prove that there be no basis for the view that a plan of the world be form in gods mind consist of distinct ideas differently arrange in the way an architect form in his head the plan of a house that he intend to build it isnt easy to see what be gain by this supposition that god have such a plan whether we steer by reason or by experience you have offer this suppose plan as a satisfactory and conclusive cause of the world but we can not leave it at that for we still have to raise the further question about the cause of this cause look for an answer let us first consult reason then experience if reason i mean abstract reason involve a priori thoughts be not equally silent with regard to all question concern cause and effect it will at least venture to say this much a mental world or universe of ideas stand in as much need of a cause as do a material world or universe of object and if the mental world be similar in its arrangement to the material one their cause must be similar for there be nothing here to give rise to a different conclusion or inference regard one world from what we can conclude regard the other look at abstractly they be entirely alike and any problem concern either of them be equally a problem for the other if we turn to experience compel it to say something on these subject that lie beyond its sphere it reply that it cant see any significant difference between these two kinds of worlds so far as causation be concern it find them to be govern by similar principles and to depend on an equal variety of cause in their operations we have specimens in miniature of both sort of world our mind resemble the one a plant or animal the other so let experience judge from these sample which be within its sphere nothing seem more intricate in its cause than think be because these cause never operate in the same way in two people we never find two people who think exactly alike indeed one person doesnt think in exactly the same way at any two time a difference of age of the disposition of his body of weather of food of company of book of passionsany of these detail and others that be less conspicuous be sufficient to alter the precise machinery of think and cause very different movements and operations in it as far as we can judge plant and animal body be no more intricate in their motion and dont depend on a greater variety or more precise adjustment of spring and force now as well as the question concern the cause of the be whom you suppose to be the author of nature your system of anthropomorphism confront us with another question concern the cause of the mental world that you see as cause the material worldthat be the cause of gods plan how can we satisfy ourselves about that havent we the same reason to see that mental world as cause by another mental world or new force of think but if we stop there refuse to raise the question about the cause of gods plan why do we go as far as gods plan why not stop at the material world how can we satisfy ourselves without go on to infinity not that there be any satisfaction in the infinite sequence of cause of cause of let us remember the story of the indian philosopher and his elephant he think that the earth need something to hold it up and suppose it rest on an elephant which he then suppose rest on a tortoise the story be never more applicable than it be to the present subject switch from a spatial to a causal interpretation of rest on if the material world rest causally on a mental world that be similar to it this mental world must rest on some other and so on without end it would be better therefore never to look beyond the present material world by suppose it to contain within itself the cause of its order we be really take it to be god and the sooner we arrive at that divine be the better when you go one step beyond the system of the familiar world you only stir people up into ask question that cant possibly be answer you may say the different ideas that make up gods plan fall into order of themselves and by their own nature but that have no precise mean if it have a mean i would like to know why it be not equally good sense to say the part of the material world fall into order of themselves and by their own nature can one opinion be intelligible when the other isnt we do indeed have experience of ideas that fall into order of themselves and without any know cause outside them but i be sure we have much more experience of matter that do the samefor example in every case of generation and vegetation where it be beyond our capacities to work out what the cause be in this work generation usually the whole process through which animals have offspring and vegetation the correspond process for plant we have also experience of particular systems of think and of matter that have no orderof think in madness of matter in the decay of dead organisms so why should we think that order be more essential to one than to the other and if order require a cause in both what advantage do your system give us when it take the material universe of object to be cause by a similar mental universe of ideas our first step beyond the material world lead us on for ever so it would be wise of us to limit all our enquiries to the present world without look beyond it we can get no satisfaction from these speculations that so far exceed the narrow limit of human understand as you know cleanthes when the ancient aristotelians be ask about the cause of some phenomenon they usually reply in term of their concepts of faculty or occult quality ask why bread nourish for instance they would say that bread nourish by its nutritive faculty and that senna purge by its purgative faculty but it have turn out that this device be merely a disguise for ignorance and that those philosophers be really sayingthough less openlythe same thing as the sceptics and the plain people say when they candidly admit that they dont know what cause these phenomena well now when we ask what cause order in the ideas of god can you anthropomorphites give any answer except that the cause be a rational faculty and that such be the nature of god if that be acceptable then it be hard to see why it isnt equally acceptable to account for the worlds order in a similar wayappealing to faculties and natures that material things havewithout have recourse to any such think creator as you insist on it be only to say that this be the nature of material object and that they all have an inherent faculty of order and proportion which be merely more learn and elaborate ways of admit ignorance the comparable story about gods plan be no better than this one about the material worldexcept in be closer to the prejudice of common people you have present this argument with great emphasis reply cleanthes apparently not realize how easy it be to answer it when in everyday life i assign a cause for some event philo be it any objection that i cant assign the cause of that cause and answer every new question that may endlessly be raise in read the next bite remember that in hum day philosopher cover scientists as well what philosophers could possibly submit to so rigid a rule philosophers admit that ultimate cause be totally unknown and they be aware that the most refine principles which they use to explain the phenomena be as inexplicable to them as the phenomena themselves be to the common people so there can be no question of their agree that its no use assign a cause unless you also assign the cause of the cause the order and arrangement of nature the intricate adjustment of things to their purpose the plain use and intend purpose of every part and organ of a plant or animalall these announce in the clearest language an intelligent cause or author the heavens and the earth join in the same testimony the whole chorus of nature raise one hymn to the praise of its creator you alone or almost alone disturb this general harmony you start abstruse doubt complaints and objections you ask me what be the cause of this cause i dont know and i dont care i have find a god and with that i stop my enquiry let those who be wiser or more enterprising go further i dont claim to be wiser or more enterprising reply philo and for that very reason i might never have try to go so far especially when im aware that i must eventually settle for the same answer that i mightsaving myself all that troublehave settle for from the begin if i be still to remain in utter ignorance of cause and cant give a full explanation of anything i shall never think it be an advantage to shove off for a moment a difficulty which you admit must immediately come back to me with its full force natural scientists indeed very properly explain particular effect by more general cause even when these general cause themselves be in the end totally inexplicable but surely they never think it satisfactory to explain a particular effect by a particular cause that be no more explicable than the effect itself a system of ideas arrange by itself without a prior design be not a whit more explicable than a material system that attain its order in the same way there be no more difficulty in the latter supposition than in the former but to show you still more inconvenience in your anthropomorphism continue philo please look again at your principles like effect prove like cause this be the basis for every empirical argument and you say that it be also the only basis for the theological argument now it be certain that the more similar the observe effect and the more similar the cause that be infer the stronger be the argument every move away from similarity between the effect or between the cause lower the probability and make the empirical argument less conclusive you cant doubt the principle so you oughtnt to reject its consequences accord to the true system of theism all the new discoveries in astronomy which prove the immense grandeur and magnificence of the work of nature be further arguments for the existence of a god accord to your hypothesis of empirical theism they become objections by move the universe still further from all resemblance to the effect of human skill and contrivance if the argument for genuine theism have force in earlier time how much more force it must have now when the bound of nature be so infinitely enlarge and such a magnificent scene be open to us as evidence of its support in ancient time philo quote in latin from lucretius and cicero then it be still more unreasonable to form our idea of the cause of such an unlimited effect on the basis of our experience of the cause of the narrow products of human design and invention the discoveries by microscopes as they open a new universe in miniature be arguments for theism accord to me whereas to you they be objections to it the further we push our research of this kind the more we be lead to infer that the universal cause of it all be vastly different from mankind and from anything of which we have empirical knowledge and what do you have to say about the discoveries in anatomy chemistry botany those surely be not objections interrupt cleanthes they only reveal new instance of skill and contrivance it be still the image of mind reflect on us from innumerable object add a mind like the human say philo thats the only kind i know reply cleanthes and the more like the better insist philo to be sure say cleanthes now cleanthes say philo pounce with an air of triumph note the consequences first by this method of reason you give up all claim to infinity in any of the attribute of god for as the cause ought to be proportion to the effect and the effectso far as we knowis not infinite what right have we on your theory to ascribe infinity to god you will still have to say that when we remove him so far from similarity to human creatures we give in to the most arbitrary hypothesis and at the same time weaken all proof of his existence secondly your theory give you no reason to ascribe perfection to god even in his capacity as a finite be or to suppose him to be free from every error mistake or incoherence in his activities consider the many inexplicable difficulties in the work of natureillnesses earthquakes flood volcanoes and so on if we think we can prove a priori that the world have a perfect creator all these calamities become unproblematic we can say that they only seem to us to be difficulties because we with our limit intellects cant follow all the infinitely complex detail of which they be a part but accord to your line of argument these difficulties be real indeed they might be emphasize as new instance of the worlds liken to the products of human skill and contrivance you must at least admit that we with our limit knowledge cant possibly tell whether this system contain any great fault or deserve any considerable praise when compare to other possible systems and perhaps even when compare to real ones if the aeneid be read to a peasant could he judge it to absolutely faultless could he even give it proper place in a rank of the products of human intelligencehe who have never see any of the others even if this world be a perfect product we still couldnt be sure whether all the excellences of the work could justly be ascribe to the workman when we survey a ship we may get an exalt idea of the ingenuity of the carpenter who build such a complicate useful and beautiful machine but then we shall be surprise to find that the carpenter be a stupid tradesman who imitate others and follow a trade which have gradually improve down the centuries after multiply trials mistake corrections deliberations and controversies perhaps our world be like that ship it may be that many worlds be botch and bungle throughout an eternity before our present system be build much labour lose many useless trials make and a slow but continue improvement carry on during infinite age in the worldmaking trade in such subject as this who can determine what be truewho indeed can even guess what be probablewhen so many hypotheses can be put forward and even more can be imagine and what shadow of an argument continue philo can you produce from your hypothesis to prove that god be one be a great many men join together to build a house or ship to find and develop a city to create a commonwealth why couldnt several gods combine in design and make a world this would only serve to make divine activities more like human ones by share the work among several gods we can reduce still further the attribute of each one of them we can get rid of the extensive power and knowledge that we have to suppose the one god to possess if there be only onethe extent of power and knowledge which accord to you serve merely to weaken the argument for gods existence and if such foolish vicious creatures as men can often unite in form and carry out one plan think how much more could be do by those gods or semigods whom we may suppose to be quite a lot more perfect than we be to multiply cause without necessity be indeed contrary to true philosophy but that principle doesnt apply to our present case if your theory have already establish that there be one god who have every attribute need for the production of the universe then i admit it would be needle though not absurd to suppose that any other god exist but while we be still confront the question be all these attribute unite in one thing that have them all or be they share out among several independent be what phenomena in nature can we point to as supply the answer when we see a body raise in a scale we be sure that in the opposite scaleeven if we cant see itthere be some counterbalance weight equal to it but we can still question whether that weight be a heap of many distinct body or rather one uniform unite mass for example whether it be a handful of pebbles or a single lump of lead and if the weight need for the counterbalance be very much greater than we have ever see any single body to possess the former supposition become still more probable and natural than the latter as with weight so with creators an intelligent be of such vast power and ability as be necessary to produce the universeor to speak in the language of ancient philosophy so prodigious an animalgoes beyond any analogy with ourselves and indeed go beyond what we can understand furthermore cleanthes men be mortal and renew their species by generation and so do all live creatures the two great sex of male and female say milton animate the world why shouldnt this universal and essential feature of our condition also apply to those numerous and limit gods that i be say you should argue for and that bring us back to the ancient tales about the birth of the gods indeed why not become a perfect anthropomorphite why not assert that god isor that each god iscorporeal have eye a nose mouth ears etc epicurus maintain that no man have ever see reason except in someone of human shape and that therefore the gods must have that shape this inference be deservedly ridicule by cicero but by your standards it be solid and philosophical in a word cleanthes someone who follow your hypothesis can perhaps assert or conjecture that the universe at some time arise from something like design but beyond that he cant make a case for any further detail and be leave to fill in his theology by wildly imagine or guess the rest for all he know the world be very faulty and imperfect by certain higher standards which open the doors to all sort of theologies no one of which he can refute here be just three of them this world be only the first rough attempt of some infant god who afterwards abandon it ashamed of his poor performance it be the work of some dependent inferior god whose superiors hold it up for ridicule it be produce by some god in his old age and nearsenility and ever since his death the world have continue without further guidance activate by the first shove he give to it and the active force that he build into it you rightly give sign of horror demea at these strange suppositions but theseand a thousand more like themare cleanthes suppositions not mine as soon as the attribute of god be suppose to be finite all these suppositions get a foothold speak for myself i cant see that have such a wild and unsettle a system of theology be in any way preferable to have none at allthat be be an atheist i absolutely disown these suppositions exclaim cleanthes but they dont fill me with horror especially when put forward in the casual way in which you throw them off on the contrary they give me pleasure when i see that even when give your imagination completely free rein you dont get rid of the hypothesis of design in the universe but be oblige to rely on it at every turn that concession be what i stick to and i regard it as a sufficient foundation for religion it must be a flimsy build say demea that can be erect on such a shaky foundation while we be uncertain whether there be one god or many whether god or the gods to whom we owe our existence be perfect or imperfect subordinate or supreme dead or alive what trust or confidence can we put in them what devotion or worship can we offer them what veneration or obedience give to them this theory of religion become altogether useless for all the practical purpose of life and even when it be consider merely as a speculative theological theory the uncertainty you attribute to it must render it totally precarious and unsatisfactory to make it still more unsatisfactory say philo ive think of another hypothesis that must seem probable when evaluate in term of the method of reason that cleanthes insist on so much he take the basis for all religion to be this similar effect arise from similar cause but there be another principle of the same kind equally certain and support in the same way by experience namely where several know circumstances be observe to be similar the unknown will also be find similar example if we see the limbs of a human body we conclude that it be accompany by a human head even if we cant see it second example if we see a small part of the sun through a crack in a wall we conclude that if the wall be remove we would see the whole sun in short this type of inference be so obvious and familiar that there can be no doubt as to its soundness now if we survey the universe far as we know it it bear a great resemblance to an animal or organic body and seem to be drive by a source of life and motion like the one that drive organisms a continual circulation of matter in it produce no disorder a continual waste in every part be incessantly repair the different part of the whole system be see to act in harmony with one another and each part of the world or member of an organism in do its proper job operate both for its own preservation and for that of the whole from all this i infer the the world be an animal and that god be the mind of the world drive it and be affect by it you have too much learn cleanthes to be at all surprise by this opinion which as you know be maintain by almost all the theists of antiquity and be the main theology that one find in their discourse and reason for though the ancient philosophers sometimes reason from final cause point to evidence of purpose in the world as if they think the world to be something god make yet their favourite idea seem to have be that the world be gods body which be organize in such a way that it obey his command just as your body be so organize thatfor examplewhen you decide to raise your arm it rise the universe be more like a human body than like the work of human skill and plan so if it be ever appropriate to liken the whole of nature to any facts about us with all our limit it seem that the ancient analogy between the universe and our body be sounder than the modern one between the universe and the things we make the former theory also have many other advantage that recommend it to the ancient theologians here be one important one nothing clash more with all their notions because nothing clash more with common experience than mind without bodythe idea of a purely mental substance which they didnt understand and of which they hadnt observe a single instance throughout all of nature they know mind and body because they felt both they also know an order arrangement organization or internal machinery in both mind and body again because they felt both so it be bind to seem reasonable to transfer this experience of themselves to the universe that be to suppose that neither the divine mind nor the divine body come first and that each of them have an order and arrangement that be naturally inherent in it and inseparable from it so here be a new sort of anthropomorphism cleanthes for you to think about and its a theory that doesnt seem to be open to any great difficulties im sure you be above such theoretical prejudice as to find any more difficulty in suppose an animal body to be order and organize originally of itself or from unknown cause than in suppose a mind to be order in that way so you might think that liken the universe to an animal body doesnt require suppose that be drive by a mind a divine mind but the common prejudice that body and mind ought always to accompany each other ought not to be entirely neglect for it be base on common experience which be the only guide you claim to follow in all these theological enquiries if you say that our limit experience be an inadequate standard by which to form opinions about the unlimited extent of nature then you will be entirely abandon your own hypothesis and will have to adopt our mysticism as you call it and admit that gods nature be absolutely incomprehensible i admit reply cleanthes that this theory have never before occur to me though it be a pretty natural one i cant give an opinion about it until i have have more time to think it over you be very scrupulous indeed say philomore scrupulous than i be if you have present me with a system of yours i wouldnt have be half as cautious and reserve in start objections and difficulties to it however if anything do occur to you please tell us why then reply cleanthes it seem to me that though the world do in many ways resemble an animal body this analogy be also defective in many important respect no organs of sense no seat of think or reason no one precise origin of motion and action in short it seem to be more like a plant than an animal and that weaken your inference to the mind of the world secondly your theory seem to imply the eternity of the world and that thesis i believe can be refute by the strongest reason and probabilities i shall suggest an argument against itone that i think hasnt be insist on by any writer first though we should look at a different and less strong argument for the worlds have have a begin it be argue that the arts and sciences come into existence only recently and so the worlds past be fairly short this inference have some force but perhaps it can be refutedor rather its premise can be undercutby a point concern the nature of human society we continually revolve between ignorance and knowledge between liberty and slavery between riches and poverty so our limit experience doesnt enable us to foretell with confidence what outcomes may or may not be expect ancient learn and history seem to have be in great danger of entirely perish after the influx of the barbarous nations into the roman empire and if these convulsions have continue a little longer or be a little more violent we would probably not have know now what happen in the world a few centuries ago indeed the latin language would have be utterly lose if it werent for the superstition of the popes who preserve a little latin jargon so as to keep their church look ancient and universal with latin lose the western world would have be totally barbarous and so wouldnt have be in a fit state to receive the greek language and learn that come to them after the sack of constantinople when learn and book have be extinguish even the practical arts skills and trade would have fall into considerable decay and it be easy to imagine that in that case fable or tradition might ascribe to those arts a much later origin than they actually have and so by parity of argument we be not entitle to confidence that we arent do the same thing because the record of vastly earlier arts and sciences have be wipe out this common argument against the eternity of the world therefore seem a little precarious but here be what seem to be the basis for a better argument lucullus be the first person who bring cherrytrees from asia to europe yet that tree thrive so well in many european climates that it grow in the woods without be cultivate be it possible that throughout a whole eternity no european ever visit asia and think of transplant such a delicious fruit into his own country if it be once transplant and propagate before the time of lucullus how could it ever afterwards perish empires may rise and fall liberty and slavery succeed alternately ignorance and knowledge give place to each otherbut the cherrytree will still remain in the woods of greece spain and italy and will never be affect by the revolutions of human society it be less than two thousand years since vines be transplant into france though there be no climate in the world more favourable to them it be less than three centuries since horse cow sheep pig dog and corn be first know in america be it possible that during the revolutions of a whole eternity there never arise a columbus who could put europe into communication with that continent we may as well imagine that all men would wear stock for ten thousand years and never have the sense to think of garter to tie them all these seem convince proof that the world be young indeed a mere infant because the argument involve them be base on principles that be more constant and steady than those by which human society be govern and direct it would take a total convulsion of the elements to destroy all the european animals and vegetables that be now to be find on the american continent well what argument have you against such convulsions reply philo strong and almost incontestable evidence can be find over the whole earth that every part of this planet have for centuries be entirely cover with water and even if order be inseparable from matter and inherent in it still matter may be susceptible of many and great revolutions through the endless periods of eternal duration we can see that in the change and collapse of which we have have experience the world have merely pass from one state of order to another and matter cant ever stay in a totally disorder and confuse state still the constant change that occur in every part of the material world seem to suggest that some such general transformations sometimes occur what we see in the part we may infer in the wholeat any rate thats the pattern of argument on which you rest your whole theory and if i have to defend some particular system of this type which i would never do willingly i find none of them more plausible than the theory that ascribe to the world an eternal inherent order force though accompany by great and continual revolutions and alterations this at once solve all the difficulties and if the solution be too lack in detail to be entirely complete and satisfactory it be at least a theory that we must eventually accept whatever more detail system we embrace how could things have be as they be if there be not an original inherent principle of order somewherein think or in matter it doesnt matter in the slightest which of thesethought or matterwe prefer no hypothesis whether sceptical or religious should make room for chance everything be surely govern by steady inviolable laws and if the inmost essence of things be lay open to us we would then discover a scene of which at present we can have no idea instead of wonder at the order of natural things we would see clearly that it be absolutely impossible for their order to be differenteven in some tiny detailfrom what it be in actuality if anyone want to revive the ancient pagan theology which maintain as we learn from hesiod that this planet be govern by gods who arise from the unknown power of nature you would naturally object cleanthes that nothing be gain by this hypothesis and that its as easy to suppose all men and animalsmore numerous but less perfectto have spring immediately from a source of that kind push the same inference a step further and you will find that a large society of gods be no harder to explain than one universal god who contain within himself the power and perfections of the whole society so you must allow that all these systemsscepticism polytheism and theismare on an equal foot when judge by your principles that show you that your principles be wrong in think about the ancient system of god as the mind of the world philo continue i have just be strike by a new idea if it be right it come close to subvert all your reason and destroy even the first inferences in which you place such confidence if the universe resemble animal body and plant more than it do the work of human skill it be more probable that its cause resemble the cause of the former than the cause of the latter so its origin ought to be ascribe to generation or vegetation rather than to reason or design so your conclusion be lame and defective even accord to your own principles please expand this argument a little say demea for i havent properly grasp it in the concise form in which you have express it our friend cleanthes reply philo as you have hear assert that since no question of fact can be answer except through experience the existence of a god can not be prove in any other way the world he say resemble things make by human skill so its cause must also resemble the cause of human artifacts i note in pass that the operation of one very small part of nature namely man on another very small part namely the inanimate matter lie within his reach be the basis on which cleanthes judge of the origin of the whole of nature he measure the vast whole by the same individual standard as he do the tiny part but i shant press that point if we be go to argue from part to the whole let us at least be careful about what part we select for this special treatment i affirm that some part of the universe other than the machine of human invention be still more like the fabric of the world than machine be and therefore point to a better conjecture about the origin of this whole system of the universe these part be animals and plant the world plainly resemble an animal or a plant more than it do a watch or a knittingloom its cause be therefore more likely to resemble the cause of the former than to resemble the cause of the latter the cause of the former be generation or vegetation so we can conclude that the cause of the world be something similar or analogous to generation or vegetation but how be it conceivable say demea that the world can arise from anything similar to vegetation or generation very easily reply philo here be one way it could happen just as a tree shed its seed into the neighbour field and produce other tree so the great plant the world or this planetary system produce within itself certain seed which it scatter into the surround chaos in which they grow into new worlds a comet for instance be the seed of a world and after it have be fully ripen by pass from sun to sun and star to star it be at last toss into the unformed elements which everywhere surround this universe and immediately sprout up into a new system or we might suppose this world to be an animal there be no advantage in this but let try it just for variety so a comet be the egg of this animal and just as an ostrich lay its egg in the sand where the egg hatch without any further care and produce a new animal so i understand you interrupt demea but what wild arbitrary suppositions be these what data have you for such extraordinary conclusions be the slight imaginary resemblance of the world to a plant or an animal sufficient to support conclusions about the world base on what happen with plant or animals ought object that be in general so widely different be take as a standard for each other right exclaim philo that be what i have be insist on all along i have go on assert that we have no data to establish any system of cosmogony theory system or story about the origin of the world our experience which be so imperfect in itself and which cover such small stretch of space and time cant give us any probable conjecture concern the whole of things but if we have to settle for some hypothesis tell me what rule we can use to make our choice be there any rule except the one that base the greater acceptability of an hypothesis on the greater similarity of the object compare and doesnt a plant or an animal that arise from vegetation or generation resemble the world more closely than do any artificial machine that arise from reason and design but what be this vegetation and generation of which you talk say demea can you explain how they work and lay out the detail of that fine internal structure on which they depend i can do that reply philo at least as well as cleanthes can explain how reason work or lay out in detail the internal structure on which it depend but i dont need to go into all that it be enough that when i see an animal i infer that it arise from generation and be as sure of this as you be when you infer that a house arise from design the word generation and reason serve merely to label certain power and energies in nature we know the effect of these power but have no grasp of their essence and neither of them have a better claim that the other to be make a standard for the whole of nature in fact demea we can reasonably expect that the wider the range of facts that we take in the better they will guide us in our conclusions about such extraordinary and magnificent subject in this little corner of the world alone there be four principles here drive force or source of energy reason instinct generation vegetation that be similar to each other and be the cause of similar effect how many other principles can we naturally suppose to be at work in the immense extent and variety of the universeprinciples that we might discover if we could travel from planet to planet and from system to system so to examine each part of this mighty structure any one of the above four principles and a hundred others which lie open if not to our sense then at least to our conjecture can give us a theory about the origin of the world and to confine our view entirely to the one of the four that govern how our own mind operatenamely reasonis to be guilty of gross bias if reason be more intelligible to us than the other three principles because it govern our mind there would be some excuse for our bias in its favour but that isnt how things stand because the internal structure of reason be really as little know to us as be the structure of instinct and vegetation even that vague indeterminate word nature which common people drag in to explain everything stand for something that be basically no more inexplicable than reason our experience show us the effect of these principles but the principles themselves and their ways of work be totally unknown to us to say the world arise by vegetation from a seed shed by another world be not less intelligible or less in harmony with experience than to say the world arise from a divine reason or plan take this in the sense in which cleanthes understand it but if the world do have a vegetative quality say demea and could sow the seed of new worlds into the infinite chaos i would see this power as a further argument for design in its author for where could such a wonderful power come from if not from design how can order spring from anything which doesnt perceive the order which it give you need only look around you reply philo to get the answer to this question a tree give order and organization to the tree that arise from it without know that order similarly with an animal and its offspring a bird and its nest there be in the world more examples of this kind than there be instance of order arise from reason and plan to say that all this order in animals and plant proceed ultimately from design be to assume the very point that be at issue the only way to settle the point in favour of design would be to prove a priori both that order be from its own nature inseparably attach to think and that order be prevent from belong to matter either by its own nature or by some unknown basic principle furthermore demea the objection you have just bring cant be make by cleanthes unless he give up a defence that he use against one of my objections when i ask about the cause of that supreme reason and intelligence from which he derive everything else cleanthes say this the impossibility of answer such question be never a legitimate objection in any kind of philosophy we must stop somewhere and wherever we stop more question can be raise because humans will never be able to explain ultimate cause or to show the absolutely basic connections between things all that should be demand be that whatever step we do take be support by experience and observation now it cant be deny that order in nature be find by experience to come from vegetation and generation as well as from reason it be for me to choose whether to base my system of cosmogony on the former rather than on the latter the choice seem entirely arbitrary and when cleanthes ask me what the cause be of my vegetative or generative faculty i be equally entitle to ask him what cause his reason principle we have agree to pass up these question on both side and in our present context it be in his interest to stick to this agreement judge by our limit and imperfect experience generation have some privilege over reason for we see every day reason arise from generationfor example my reason which have in its causal ancestry my parent beget of mebut never see generation arise from reason please compare the consequences on both side the world i say resemble an animal so it be an animal so it arise from generation the step in that argument be jump i admit but each of them involve some small appearance of analogy between world and animal the world say cleanthes resemble a machine so it be a machine so it arise from design these step be jump too and here the analogybetween world and machineis less strike and if he claim to push one step further than my hypothesis by infer that design or reason cause the great principle of generation which i have emphasize i have a better right to push one step further than his hypothesis by infer that a divine generation or godbirth cause his principle of reason i have empirical evidence on my side because reason be observe in countless case to arise from generation and never to arise from any other source this be admittedly only a faint shadow of evidence for my hypothesis but on this topic faint shadow be the best we can do the ancient mythologists be so strike with this analogy that they all explain the origin of nature in term of birth and copulation plato too so far as he be intelligible seem to have adopt some such notion in his timaeus the brahmins assert that the world arise from an infinitely large spider who spin this whole complicate mass from his bowels and then annihilate all or some of it by absorb it again and take it into his own essence here be a kind of cosmogony that strike us as ridiculous because a spider be a negligible little animal whose do we be never likely to take for a model of the whole universe still even for us on our planet this be a new kind of analogy for us to think about if there be as there well might be a planet wholly inhabit by spiders this inference would seem there as natural and secure against criticism as the one that here ascribe the origin of all things to design and intelligence as explain by cleanthes he will find it hard to give a satisfactory reason why an orderly system might not be spin from the belly as well as from the brain i must say philo reply cleanthes that the task you have undertake of raise doubt and objections suit you better than it do anyone else alive it seem in a way natural and unavoidable to you you be so fertile in your inventions that i be not ashamed to admit that i cant straight off solve in a discipline way such outoftheway difficulties as you keep launch at me though i can clearly see in a general way that they be wrong i have no doubt that you be at present in the same position as i be not have any solution as ready to hand as the objection and you must be aware that common sense and reason be entirely against you and that whimsical hypotheses like the ones you have produce may puzzle us but can never convince us what you ascribe to the fertility of my invention reply philo come purely from the nature of the subject in topics that be suit to our limit human reason there be often only one view that carry probability or conviction with it and to a man of sound judgment all other suppositions appear entirely absurd and fanciful but in question like our present one a hundred mutually contradictory view can get some kind of support because each preserve a kind of imperfect analogy so here with all those contenders and no clear winner invention have full scope to exert itself i believe that i could in an instant and with no great effort of think propose still further systems of cosmogony that would have some faint appearance of truth though the odds be a thousandindeed a millionto one against any of them or yours be the true system for instance what if i should revive the old epicurean hypothesis this be commonly and i think rightly regard as the most absurd system ever yet propose but i suspect that with a few alterations it might be give a faint appearance of probability instead of suppose matter to be infinite as epicurus do let us suppose it to be finite and also suppose space to be finite while still suppose time to be infinite a finite number of particles in a finite space can have only a finite number of transpositions and in an infinitely long period of time every possible order or position of particles must occur an infinite number of time so this world with all its events right down to the tiniest detail have already be produce and destroy and will again be produce and destroy an unlimited number of time noone who properly grasp the difference between infinite and finite will have any trouble with this conclusion but this presuppose say demea that matter can come to move without any voluntary agent or first mover without any agent that cause the motion by will or decide that it shall occur and wheres the difficulty in that reply philo in advance of experience every outcome be as hard to credit and as incomprehensible as every other and after experience every outcome be as easy to believe and as intelligible as every other matter often start to move through gravity through elasticity through electricity without any know voluntary agent and to suppose that in all these case there be an unknown voluntary agent be merely to put forward an hypothesisand one that have no advantage that unaided matter should put itself into motion be as conceivable a priori as that it should be put into motion by mind and intelligence besides why cant motion have be pass from object to object by impact and the same or nearly the same stock of it go on be maintain in the universe the motion lose in one process be gain in the opposite process hume write as much be lose by the composition of motion as much be gain by its resolution and whatever the cause of it be the fact be certain that matter be and always have be in continual agitation as far as human experience or tradition reach in the whole universe right now there be probably not one particle of matter at absolute rest philo go on and this very consideration that we have stumble on in the course of the argument suggest yet another hypothesis of cosmogony that isnt entirely absurd and improbable be there a system an order an arrangement of things through which matter can preserve the perpetual agitation that seem essential to it and yet maintain a constancy in the form it produce philo may be use form to refer to any regularly order part of the physical world but he be evidently think mainly of organisms especially animals yes there certainly be such an arrangement for this be actually the case with the present world in which matter be constantly move and yet many form and structure remain the same if matter move continually and have only a finite number of order into which it can fall assume that matter and space be both finite it must eventually produce this arrangement or order that the world actually have and by its very nature this order once it be establish support itself for many age if not to eternity but wherever matter be poise arrange and adjust in such a way as to continue in perpetual motion and yet preserve a constancy in the form the state of affairs be bind to have the very same appearance of plan and skill that we observe at present every part of each form must be relate to each other part of it and to the whole form and the whole form itself must be relate to the other part of the universeto the element in which the form subsist to the materials with which it repair its waste and decay and to every other form which be hostile or friendly towards it a defect in any of those respectsas when arteries fail to carry blood to the brain or a trout become unable to get oxygen out of the water it swim in or a heron become unable to escape hawk or to capture fishdestroys the form and the matter of which it be compose be again set loose and be throw into irregular motion and fermentations until it unite itself to some other regular form for example by be eat if no such form be prepare to receive it and if there be a great quantity of this corrupt matter in the universe the universe itself come to be entirely disorder and this hold true whether what be destroy be the feeble embryo of a world in its first beginnings or the rotten carcass of a world drift into old age and infirmity in either case a chaos ensue until through countlessly though not infinitely many rearrangements there come to be yet again some form whose part and organs be so adjust that they enable the form to stay in existence while the matter in them continually change i shall try to put all this differently suppose that matter be throw into some position by a blind unguided force it be obvious that this first position must in all probability be utterly confuse and disorderly with no resemblance to the human artifacts which display along with a symmetry of part an adjustment of mean to end and a tendency to selfpreservation if the original actuate force cease after this first operation and stop impart motion to matter matter will have to remain for ever in disorder and continue to be an immense chaos without any proportion or activity but suppose that the actuate force whatever it may be still continue to drive matter along this first position will immediately give place to a second which will likewise in all probability be as disorderly as the first and so on through many series of change and revolutions no particular order or position ever stay unaltered for a moment the original force still at work give a perpetual restlessness to matter every possible state of affairs be produce and instantly destroy if a glimpse or dawn of order appear for a moment it be instantly hurry away reduce to a confusion by that neverceasing force which drive every part of the material world thus the universe go on for many age in a continuous series of state of chaos and disorder but couldnt it happen that it eventually settle down not so as to lose its motion and active force for we be assume that that be inherent in it but so as to preserve a uniformity of appearance through all the hubbub of its move part this be what we find to be the actual state of the universe at present every individual be perpetually change and so be every part of every individual and yet the whole appear to be the same a tiny example a rabbit take in pure air and breathe out foul air it drink water and emit urine it eat grass and extrude faeces and yet through all this change in its constituent matter it appear to us as the very same rabbit isnt this state of affairs one that might be hop forindeed one that would be sure to ariseout of the eternal revolutions of unguided matter and couldnt this account for all the appearances of wisdom and plan that the universe contain think about this a little and youll find that if matter do arrive at this setup in which form seem to be stable while their part be really move and change with them that would provide a plausible and perhaps a true solution of the problem of explain the appearance of design in the universe so its pointless to stress the use of the part in animals or plant and their intricate interplay between the part id like to know how an animal could survive if its part be not so interrelate when an animals part lose those interrelations dont we find that it immediately die and that its decay flesh and blood try some new form it happen indeed that the part of the world be so well adjust to one another that some regular form immediately lay claim to this decay matter if that didnt happen could the biological world continue to exist wouldnt it die along with the individual animal and its constituent matter go through new position and relationships untilafter a vast but finite series of changesit fall at last into an order such as the one we actually have it be just as well reply cleanthes that you tell us that this hypothesis come to you suddenly in the course of the argument if you have take the time to examine it you would soon have see the insuperable objections that it be open to you say that no form can survive unless it have the power and organs need for survival some new order or arrangement must be try and another and another and so on without interruption until at last some order that can support and maintain itself happen to come into existence but accord to this hypothesis what bring about the many conveniences and advantage that men and all animals have two eye two ears arent absolutely necessary for the survival of the species the human race could have exist and continue without there be any horse dog cow sheep and those innumerable fruit and products which bring us satisfaction and enjoyment if no camels have be create for the use of man in the sandy desert of africa and arabia would the world have be dissolve if no magnet have be form so as to give that wonderful and useful direction to the compassneedle would human society and the human species have be immediately extinguish the rule by which nature work be in general far from lavish but still instance of this kind be far from be rare and any one of them be a sufficient proof that a designa benevolent designgave rise to the order and arrangement of the universe at least you can safely conclude say philo that the hypothesis i put forward be not yet complete and perfect and i readily admit that but can we ever reasonably expect greater success in any attempt of this nature can we ever hope to construct a system of cosmogony that will be free of exceptions and in no way conflict with our limit and imperfect experience of the analogy of nature your own theory surely cant claim to be as good as that even though you have embrace anthropomorphism so as to improve the theorys conformity to common experience let us try it out yet again in all instance that we have ever encounter ideas be copy from real object you reverse this order and make think come first in all instance that we have ever encounter think have no influence on matter except where that matter be so conjoin with think as to have an equal reciprocal influence on it all that an animal can move immediately be part of its own body and the condition of those can in return affect the animals mental state and indeed the equality of action and reaction seem to be a universal law of nature your theory imply a contradiction to this experience it would be easy to assemble plenty more such difficulties especially in the supposition of a mind or system of think that be eternal in other word an animal that be never bear and will never die these instance can teach us all to be moderate in our criticisms of each other and let us see that just as no system of this kind ought ever to be accept on the basis of a slight analogy so none should be reject on account of a small incongruity for that be a drawback from which we can reasonably hold no system of cosmogony be exempt every religious system be hold by many people to be subject to great and insuperable difficulties each disputant have his period of triumph while he carry on an offensive war and expose the absurdities barbarities and pernicious doctrines of his antagonist but religious systems take all together provide the sceptic with a complete and permanent triumph for he tell the disputants that no system of cosmogony ought ever to be accept for the simple reason that no system of anything ought ever to be accept if it be absurd a total suspension of judgment be here our only reasonable resource and give that we commonly see that among theologians every attack succeed and every defence fail how complete a victory must come to someone who remain always on the offensive against all mankind and have himself no fix position or abide city that he be ever oblige to defend but if there be so many difficulties in the a posteriori argument say demea hadnt we better stay with the simple and sublime a priori argument which cut off all doubt and difficulty with a single blow by offer to us an infallible knockdown proof furthermore this argument let us prove the infinity of gods attributesthat he be infinitely wise infinitely good infinitely powerful and so onwhich i be afraid can never be establish with certainty in any other manner for how can an infinite cause be infer from an effect that be finite or that may be finite for all we know to the contrary the unity of gods nature also be very hardif not absolutely impossibleto infer merely from observe the work of nature even if it be grant that the plan of the universe be all of a piece that isnt enough to ensure us of gods unity whereas the a priori argument cleanthes interrupt you seem to reason demea as if those advantage and conveniences in the abstract a priori argument be full proof of its soundness but in my opinion we should first settle what argument with all these advantage you choose to insist on and then we can try to decide what value to put on itdoing this better by look at the argument itself than by consider its useful consequences the argument that i would insist on reply demea be the common one whatever exist must have a cause or reason for its existence as it be absolutely impossible for anything to produce itself or be the cause of its own existence in work back therefore from effect to cause we must either go on trace cause to infinity without any ultimate cause at all or at last have recourse to some ultimate cause that be necessarily existent and therefore doesnt need an external cause supposition be absurd as i now prove in the suppose infinite chain or series of cause and effect each single effect be make to exist by the power and efficacy of the cause that immediately precede it but the whole eternal chain or series consider as a whole be not cause by anything and yet it obviously require a cause or reason as much as any particular thing that begin to exist in time we be entitle to ask why this particular series of cause exist from eternity and not some other series or no series at all if there be no necessarily existent be all the suppositions we can make about this be equally possible and there be no more absurdity in nothings have exist from eternity than there be in the series of cause that constitute the universe what be it then that make something exist rather than nothing and give existence to one particular possibility as against any of the others external cause we be suppose that there arent any chance thats a word without a mean be it nothing but that can never produce anything so we must adopt supposition and have recourse to a necessarily existent be who carry the reason of his existence in himself and can not be suppose not to exist without an express contradiction so there be such a be that be there be a god i know that philo love raise objections say cleanthes but i shant leave it to him to point out the weakness of your metaphysical reason your argument seem to me so obviously illgrounded and even if it succeed to offer so little help to the cause of true piety and religion that i shall myself venture to show what be wrong with it i start by remark that there be an evident absurdity in claim to demonstrateor to prove by any a priori argumentsany matter of fact nothing be demonstrable unless its contrary imply a contradiction nothing that be distinctly conceivable imply a contradiction whatever we conceive as existent we can also conceive as nonexistent so there be no be whose nonexistence imply a contradiction so there be no be whose existence be demonstrable i offer this argument as entirely decisive and be will to rest the whole controversy on it you claim that god be a necessarily existent be and the friends of your line of argument try to explain this necessity of his existence by say that if we know his whole essence or nature we would perceive it to be as impossible for him not to exist as for twice two not to be four but obviously this can never happen while our faculties remain the same as they be now it will always be possible for us at any time to conceive the nonexistence of something we formerly conceive to exist the mind can never have to suppose some object to remain always in existence in the way in which we always have to conceive twice two to be four so the word necessary existence have no meaningor the same thing no mean that be consistent furthermore if we do go along with this claim explanation of necessary existence why shouldnt the material universe be the necessarily existent be we dare not claim to know all the qualities of matter and for all we can tell matter may have some qualities which if we know them would make matter nonexistence appear as great a contradiction as twice twos be five i have find only one argument try to prove that the material world be not the necessarily existent be and this argument be derive from the contingency both of the matter and the form of the world any particle of matter dr clarke have say can be conceive to be annihilate and any form can be conceive to be alter such an annihilation or alteration therefore be not impossible but it seem very bias not to see that the same argument apply just as well to god so far as we have any conception of him and that our mind can at least imagine god to be nonexistent or his attribute to be alter if something be to make his nonexistence appear impossible or his attribute unalterable it must be some qualities of his that we dont know and cant conceive but then no reason can be give why these qualities may not belong to matter as they be altogether unknown and inconceivable they can never be prove incompatible with the nature of matter as we know it a further objection in trace an eternal series of items it seem absurd to ask for a general cause or first author of the entire series how can something that exist from eternity have a cause since the causal relation imply priority in time and a begin of existence also in such a chain or series of items each part be cause by the part that precede it and cause the one that follow so where be the difficulty but the whole need a cause you say i answer that the unite of these part into a whole like the unite of several distinct counties into one kingdom or several distinct members into one organic body be perform merely by an arbitrary act of the mind and have no influence on the nature of things if i show you the particular cause of each individual in a collection of twenty particles of matter i would think it very unreasonable if you then ask me what be the cause of the whole twenty the cause of the whole be sufficiently explain by explain the cause of the part your reason cleanthes may well excuse me from raise any further difficulties say philo but i cant resist bring up another point arithmeticians have note that every product of have integers which add up to or to some lesser product of thus of and which be products of you make by add to to and to thus be a product also of and if you add and you make which be a lesser product of to a superficial observer this splendid regularity may be wonder at as the effect either of chance or design but a skillful algebraist immediately conclude it to be the work of necessity and demonstrate that it must forever result from the nature of these number isnt it probable i now ask that the whole way the universe work depend on this sort of necessity though no human algebra can provide a key that solve the difficulty instead of wonder at the order of natural be mightnt it be that if we could penetrate into the intimate nature of body we would clearly see why it be absolutely impossible for them to be interrelate in any other way so you run a great risk when you introduce this idea of necessity into the present question because it naturally support an inference that be directly opposite to the religious hypothesis anyway continue philo drop all these abstractions and stay with more familiar topics i venture to remark that the a priori argument have seldom be find very convince except to people with metaphysical mind who have accustom themselves to abstract reason and who have develop bad intellectual habit because find in mathematics that the understand frequently lead through darkness to truths that at first didnt appear to be true they have transfer the same habit of think to subject where it isnt appropriate other people even ones who have good sense and strong inclinations in favour of religion always feel that there be something wrong with such arguments as the a priori argument for the existence of god even though they may not be able to explain distinctly what the defect be which be a certain proof that men always do and always will derive their religion from source other than this sort of reason it be my opinion i admit reply demea that each man somehow feel in his heart the truth of religion and that what lead him to seek protection from god the be on whom he and all nature depend be not any reason but rather his consciousness of his own weakness and misery even the best scenes of life be so trouble or so unpleasant that all our hop and fear look to the future we incessantly look forward and try through prayers adoration and sacrifice to appease those unknown power who we find by experience can so thoroughly afflict and oppress us wretched creatures that we be what help would there be for us amid the innumerable ills of life if religion didnt suggest some ways of reconcile ourselves with god and soothe the terrors with which we be incessantly agitate and torment i be indeed convince say philo that the best and indeed the only method of bring everyone to a proper sense of religion be by make them see clearly the misery and wickedness of men and for that purpose a talent for eloquence and strong imagery be more need than a talent for reason and argument what need be there to prove something that everyone feel within himself it be only necessary to make us feel it if possible more strongly and intimately indeed reply demea the people be sufficiently convince of this great and melancholy truth these phrase the miseries of life the unhappiness of man the general corruptions of our nature the unsatisfactory enjoyment of pleasures riches honour have become almost proverbial in all languages and who can doubt something that all men declare from their own immediate feel and experience on this point say philo the learn be in perfect agreement with the common people and in all literature religious and otherwise the topic of human misery have be stress with the most pathetic eloquence that sorrow and melancholy could inspire the work of the poetswhose testimony have extra authority because they speak from feel without a systemabound in image of this sort from homer down to dr edward young the whole inspire tribe of poets have always be aware that if they be to present human life in a way that fit what each individual person see and feel it as be like they will have to represent it in that way as for authorities reply demea you neednt hunt for them look around this library of cleanthes i venture to guess thatexcept for author of particular sciences such as chemistry or botany who have no occasion to treat of human lifealmost every one of those innumerable writers have somewhere or other be lead by his sense of human misery to testify to it and complain of it at any rate the odds be that almost all of them have write in that way and as far as i can remember no author have go to the opposite extreme of deny human misery there you must excuse me say philo leibniz have deny it he be perhaps the first who venture on such a bold and paradoxical opinion or anyway the first who make it essential to his philosophical system give that he be the first reply demea mightnt that very fact have make him realize that he be wrong for be this a subject on which philosophers can claim to make discoveries especially as late in history as this and can any man hope by a simple denial to outweigh the unite testimony of mankind base on sense and consciousness i say a simple denial because the subject scarcely admit of reason and he add why should man claim to be exempt from the fate of all the other animals the whole earth believe me philo be curse and pollute a perpetual war go on among all live creatures need hunger and deprivation stimulate the strong and courageous fear anxiety and terror agitate the weak and infirm the first entrance into life bring distress to the newborn infant and to its wretched it be maintain by dr king and a few others before leibniz but not by any as famous as that german philosopher mother weakness impotence and distress accompany each stage of that life and eventually it reach its end in agony and horror observe too say philo natures intricate devices for embitter the life of every live be the stronger ones prey on the weaker and keep them in perpetual terror and anxiety the weaker in their turn often prey on the stronger and vex and trouble them give them no respite think of the innumerable race of insects that either be breed on the body of an animal or fly about put their sting into him these insects be themselves torment by others that be even smaller and thus on every hand before and behind above and below every animal be surround by enemies that constantly seek his misery and destruction man alone say demea seem to be a partial exception to this rule for by come together in society men can easily master lions tigers and bear whose greater strength and agility naturally enable them to prey on him on the contrary exclaim philo it be just here that we can most clearly see how uniform and equal natures maxims be it be true that man can by combine surmount all his real enemies and become master of the whole animal kingdom but doesnt he immediately conjure up imaginary enemies the demons of his imagination who haunt him with superstitious terrors and blast every enjoyment of life he imagine that they see his pleasure as a crime and that his food and leisure annoy and offend them even his sleep and dream bring him new materials for anxious fear and death his refuge from every other ill present only the dread of endless and innumerable woes the wolf attack on the timid flock be no worse than what superstition do to the anxious feel of wretched mortals besides demea think about this very society through which we get the upper hand over those wild beasts our natural enemies what new enemies it raise against us what woe and misery it cause man be the greatest enemy of man oppression injustice contempt disrespect violence sedition war slander treachery fraudmen use these to torment one another and they would soon dissolve the society they have form if they werent afraid that even greater ills would come from their do so these external injuries say demea that we suffer from animals from men and from all the elements do indeed form a frightful catalogue of woes but they be nothing in comparison to the ones that arise within ourselves from the illnesses of our mind and body how many people lie under the linger torment of diseases hear the pathetic list of the great poet intestine stone and ulcer colicpangs demoniac frenzy mop melancholy and moonstruck madness pin atrophy marasmus and widewasting pestilence dire be the toss deep the groan despair tend the sick busiest from couch to couch and over them triumphant death his dart shake but delayd to strike though oft invokd with vow as their chief good and final hope milton paradise lose the disorder of the mind continue demea though they be more secret may be no less dismal and vexatious remorse shame anguish rage disappointment anxiety fear dejection despair who have ever pass through life without cruel attack from these tormentors many people have scarcely ever felt any better sensations than those labour and poverty so hat by everyone be the certain fate of the majority and the privilege few who enjoy leisure and wealth never reach contentment or true happiness all the goods of life put together would not make a very happy man but all the ills together would make a wretch indeed life can indeed be make unsatisfactory by almost any one of the ills and who can be free from every one or indeed by the lack of any one good and who can possess all if an alien suddenly arrive in this world i would show him as a specimen of its ills a hospital full of diseases a prison crowd with criminals and debtors a field of battle with corpses all over it a fleet of ship sink in the ocean a nation suffer under tyranny famine or plague to turn the cheerful side of life to him and give him a notion of its pleasures where should i take him to a ball to an opera to court he might reasonably think that i be only show him other kinds of distress and sorrow there be no way to escape such strike instance say philo except by explain them awayand that make the indictment even more severe why i ask have all men in all age complain incessantly of the miseries of life someone reply they have no good reason they complain only because they be dispose to be discontent regretful anxious i reply what greater guarantee of misery could there be than to have such a wretched temperament but if they be really as unhappy as they claim say my antagonist why do they stay alive not satisfy with life afraid of death milton paradise lose this be the secret chain that hold us i reply we be terrify not bribe into continue our existence it be only a false delicacy he may insist which a few refine spirit permit themselves and which have spread these complaints among the whole race of mankind and what be this delicacy i ask which you blame isnt it just a greater awareness of all the pleasures and pain of life and if the man of a delicate refine cast of mind by be so much more alive than the rest of the world be only make so much more unhappy what conclusion should we reach about human life in general if men remain at rest say our adversary they would be at ease through all their busy ambitious activity they be will makers of their own misery no i reply leisure make them anxious and slack not that it would do any good for them to give up leisure for activity and ambition bring disappointment vexation and trouble i can see something like what you describe in some others reply cleanthes but i confess that i feel little or nothing of it in myself and i hope it isnt as common as you make it out to be if you dont feel human misery yourself exclaim demea i congratulate you on your happy uniqueness others seemingly the most prosperous havent be ashamed to give voice to their complaints in the saddest tone let us attend to the great the fortunate emperor charles v when tire with human grandeur he resign all his extensive dominions into the hand of his son in the last speech he make on that memorable occasion he publicly testify that the greatest prosperities he have ever enjoy have be mix with so many adversities that he could truly say that he have never enjoy any satisfaction or contentment but do the retire life in which he hop to shelter give him any greater happiness if we can believe his sons account he start to regret his abdication on the very day he abdicate ciceros fortune rise from small beginnings to the greatest glory and fame yet his letter to friends as well as his philosophical discourse contain ever so many pathetic complaints about the ills of life and suitably to his own experience he introduce catothe great the fortunate catoprotesting in his old age that if a new life be his for the ask he would turn it down ask yourself ask anyone you know whether they would be will to live over again the last ten or twenty years of their live no but the next twenty they say will be better human misery be so great that it reconcile even contradictions and so people eventually come to complain about the shortness of life and in the same breath complain of its pointlessness and sorrow and be it possible cleanthes say philo that after all these reflections and countless others that might be suggest you still stick to your anthropomorphism and assert that the moral attribute of godhis justice benevolence mercy and uprightnessare of the same nature as these virtues in human creatures we grant that his power be infinite whatever he will to happen do happen but neither man nor any other animal be happy therefore god doesnt will their happiness his knowledge be infinite he be never mistake in his choice of mean to any end but the course of nature doesnt lead to human or animal happiness therefore nature isnt establish for that purpose through the whole range of human knowledge there be no inferences more certain and infallible than these well then in what respect do his benevolence and mercy resemble the benevolence and mercy of men epicuruss old question have still not be answer be he will to prevent evil but not able then he be impotent be he able but not will then he be malevolent be he both able and will then where do evil come from in this work as in all write on the problem of evil the topic be the entire range of bad state of affairs include every kind of suffer it be not confine to the extreme moral badness that evil stand for today you ascribe a purpose and intention to nature cleanthes and i think you be right about that but what i ask you be the aim of all the intricately design machinery that nature have display in all animals here be my answer to that the aim be simply the preservation of individuals and the continuance of the species it seem enough for natures purpose if the species be merely enable to stay in existence without any care or concern for the happiness of its individual members no mean for this be provide no machinery aim purely at give pleasure or ease no store of pure joy and contentment no gratification without some lack or need to go with it or perhaps not quite none but at least the few phenomena of this nature be outweigh by opposite phenomena of greater importance our sense of music harmony and indeed beauty of all kinds give satisfaction without be absolutely necessary to the preservation and propagation of the species but contrast that with the rack pain that arise from gouts gravel migraines toothaches rheumatisms where the injury to the animal machinery be either small so that no painsignal be need or incurable so that no painsignal be useful joy laughter play frolic seem to be gratuitous satisfactions that dont lead to anything further and spleen melancholy discontent superstition be pain that also lead nowhere how then do gods benevolence display itself accord to you anthropomorphites it be only we mystics as you be please to call us who can account for this strange mixture of phenomena by derive it from divine attribute that be infinitely perfect but incomprehensible at last philo say cleanthes with a smile you have let us see what you have be up to your long agreement with demea surprise me a little but now i see that all along you be prepare to train your gun on me and i must admit that you have now come to a subject that be worthy of your notable spirit of opposition and controversy if you can make good on your present point and prove mankind to be unhappy or corrupt there be an immediate end to all religion for what be the point of establish the natural attribute of god while his moral attribute be still doubtful and uncertain youre very quick to object reply demea to innocent opinions that be the most widely accept even among religious and devout people im immensely surprise to find this theme of the wickedness and misery of man be charge with of all things atheism and profaneness havent all pious divine and preachers who have lavish their rhetoric on this rich topic give a solution for any difficulties that may come with it this world be a mere point in comparison with the universe this life be a mere moment in comparison with eternity the present evil phenomena therefore be set right in other regions and at some future time and when that happen the eye of men be then open to broader view of things will see the whole connection of general laws and with admire wonder trace gods benevolence and justice through all the mazes and intricacies of his providence no reply cleanthes no these arbitrary suppositions can never be admit they be contrary to visible and unchallenged facts how can any cause be know except from its know effect how can any hypothesis be prove except from the experience phenomena to base one hypothesis on another be to build entirely in the air and the most we ever achieve through these conjecture and fictions be to show that our opinion be possible we can never in this way establish that it be true the only way to support divine benevolenceand it be what i willingly acceptis to deny absolutely the misery and wickedness of man your picture of the human condition be exaggerate your melancholy view be mostly fictitious your conclusions be contrary to fact and experience health be more common than sickness pleasure than pain happiness than misery i calculate that for each vexation that we meet with we get a hundred enjoyments your position be extremely doubtful reply philo but even if we allow it you must at the same time admit that if pain be less frequent than pleasure it be infinitely more violent and last one hour of pain be often able to outweigh a day a week a month of our ordinary tepid enjoyments and some people pass days weeks and months in the most acute torment pleasure hardly ever rise to the height of ecstasy and rapture and it can never continue for any time at its highest pitch and altitude the spirit evaporate the nerve relax the body be out of order and the enjoyment quickly degenerate into fatigue and uneasiness but pain oftengood god how oftenrises to torture and agony and the longer it continue the more thoroughly it become genuine agony and torture patience be exhaust courage fade melancholy seize us and nothing put an end to our misery except the removal of its causeor another event that be the sole cure of all evil though our natural foolishness lead us to regard it with still greater horror and consternation all this be obvious certain and important continue philo but i shant go on about it i do take the opportunity to warn you cleanthes that you have take your stand on most dangerous grind and without realize it have introduce a total scepticism into the most essential article of natural and reveal theology what no way to give religion a sound basis unless we allow the happiness of human life and maintain that a continue existence even in this worldwith all our actual pain infirmities vexations and folliesis satisfactory and desirable this be contrary to everyones feel and experience which mean that it be contrary to an authority so well establish that nothing can undercut it no decisive proof can ever be produce against this authority nor be it possible for you to compute estimate and compare all the pain and all the pleasures in the live of all men and of all animals and so when you rest the whole system of religion on a claim which from its very nature must for ever be uncertain you tacitly admit that the system be equally uncertain animal happiness or at least human happiness in this life exceed its miserynoone will ever believe this or at any rate youll never be able to prove it but even if we grant it to you your argument have still achieve nothing for this be far from what we expect from infinite power infinite wisdom and infinite goodness why be there any misery at all in the world not by chance surely from some cause then be it from the intention of god but he be perfectly benevolent be it contrary to his intention but he be almighty nothing can shake the solidity of this reason so short so clear so decisiveunless we say that these subject exceed all human capacity and that our common measure of truth and falsehood be not applicable to them a thesis i have all along insist on but which you have from the outset reject with scorn and indignation but i will be content to shift back from this position do this voluntarily for i deny that you can ever force me out of it i will allow for purpose of argument that pain or misery in man be compatible with infinite power and goodness in god even when these attribute be understand in your way what help do all these concessions give to your position a mere possible compatibility be not sufficient you must prove the existence of these pure unmixed and uncontrollable attribute from the present mix and confuse phenomena and from these alone a hopeful undertake even if the phenomena be ever so pure and unmixed because they be finite they would be insufficient for your purpose how much more inadequate when they be also so jar and discordant here cleanthes i find i can relax in my argument here i triumph when we argue earlier about the natural attribute of intelligence and design i need all my sceptical and metaphysical subtlety to escape your grasp in many view of the universe and of its part particularly its part the beauty and fitness of final cause strike us with such irresistible force that all objections seem to be as i think they really be mere faultfinding and trickery and then we cant imagine how we could ever give weight to them but there be no view of human life or of the condition of mankind from which we can smoothly infer the moral attribute of god or learn about that infinite benevolence conjoin with infinite power and infinite wisdom which we must discover by the eye of faith alone but now the table be turn it be now your turn to tug the labour oar and to defend your philosophical subtleties against the dictate of plain reason and experience i dont mind admit say cleanthes that i have be incline to suspect that the frequent repetition of the word infinite which we meet with in all theological writers have the flavour of praise more than of philosophy and that any purpose of reason and any purpose even of religion would be better serve if we content ourselves with more accurate and moderate expressions the term admirable excellent superlatively great wise and holythese sufficiently fill the imaginations of men and anything that go further than they do have two drawbacks it lead into absurdities and it have no influence on our feel or beliefs the way someone feel about a god who be infinitely great be exactly the way he would feel about a god who be superlatively great thus in our present subject if we abandon all human analogy as you seem to want demea i be afraid we abandon all religion and be leave with no conception of god the great object of our admire wonder if we keep the human analogy while also stay with infinite well never be able to reconcile any mixture of evil in the universe with infinite attribute much less can we ever infer the attribute from the facts about what evil there be in the universe but if we suppose the author of nature to be only finitely perfect though far more perfect than mankind we can give a satisfactory account of natural and of moral evil and every bad phenomenon can be explain and harmonize with the rest a lesser evil may then be choose in order to avoid a greater inconvenience may be put up with in order to reach a desirable end and in brief benevolence guide by wisdom and limit by necessity can produce just such a world as the one we have you philo who be so prompt at launch view and reflections and analogies i would be glad to hearat length and without interruptionyour opinion of this new theory of mine if it turn out to deserve our attention we can later take our time about shape it up and fill in detail my opinions reply philo arent worth be make a mystery of so without more ado ill tell you what occur to me regard this present subject it must be admit i think that if a be who have very limit intelligence and be utterly unacquainted with our universe be assure that it be the product of a be who though finite be very good wise and powerful this would lead him beforehand to expect something different from what our experience show the universe to be like he would never imagine merely from be inform that the cause be very good wise and powerful that the effect could be as full of vice and misery and disorder as it appear to be in this life suppose now that this person be bring into our world still sure that it be the workmanship of that sublime and benevolent be he might be surprise at the discrepancy with what he have expect but he wouldnt retract his former belief about the cause of the universe if that be found on any very solid argument for a person with such a limit intelligence must be aware of his own blindness and ignorance and must admit that these phenomena of vice misery etc may have explanations that hell never be able to understand but suppose that this creature be notas we be notconvinced in advance of a supreme intelligence benevolent and powerful but be leave to infer such a belief from the appearances of things this entirely alter the case and he will never find any reason for such a conclusion he may be fully convince of the narrow limit of his understand but this wont help him to make an inference concern the goodness of superior power because he have to make that inference from what he know not from what he be ignorant of the more you exaggerate his weakness and ignorance the more cautious you make him and the more you make him suspect that such subject be beyond the reach of his faculties you be oblige therefore to reason with him merely from the know phenomena and to drop every arbitrary supposition or conjecture if i show you a house or palace where there wasnt one convenient or agreeable apartment where the windows doors fireplaces passages stairs and the whole arrangement of the build be the source of noise confusion fatigue darkness and the extremes of heat and cold you would certainly blame the plan of the build without any further examination it would be no use for the architect to display his subtlety and to prove to you that if this door or that window be alter something worse would follow what he say may be strictly true it may be that it would only make things worse to alter one detail while leave the other part of the build unchanged but you would still say in general that if the architect have have skill and good intentions he could have plan the whole build and interrelate its part in such a way as to remedy all or most of these inconvenience his ignorance of such a planeven your own ignorance of such a planwill never convince you that it be impossible if you find any inconvenience and defect in the build you will alwaysstraight offcondemn the architect in short i repeat the question be the world consider overall and as it appear to us in this life different from what a limit be like a man would expect beforehand from a very powerful wise and benevolent god it must be a strange prejudice to assert that it isnt and from this i conclude that however consistent the world may be on certain assumptions and with allowance make with the idea of such a god it can never provide us with an inference to his existence the consistency be not absolutely deny only the inference conjecture especially when infinity be exclude from gods attribute may perhaps be sufficient to prove a consistency but they can never be foundations for any inference there seem to be four circumstances on which depend all or most of the trouble that beset conscious creatures and it isnt impossible that all these circumstances be necessary and unavoidable we know so little beyond common lifewe know indeed so little of common lifethat when it come to the way a universe be arrange any conjecture however wild may be correct so far as we can tell to the contrary and any conjecture however plausible may be erroneous so far as we can tell to the contrary the human understand in this deep ignorance and obscurity ought to be sceptical or at least cautious and oughtnt to accept any hypothesis whatever especially ones that arent support by any appearance of probability i claim that this be the case with regard to all the cause of evil and the circumstances on which it depend none of them appear to human reason to be in the slightest necessary or unavoidable and we cant suppose them to be so without let our imaginations run wild the first circumstance that introduce evil be the device or arrangement of the animal creation by which pain as well as pleasures be employ to rouse creatures to action and make them alert in the great work of selfpreservation now it seem to human understand that pleasure alone in its various level of intensity would suffice for this purpose it could have be like this all animals be constantly in a state of enjoyment but when they be urge by any of the necessities of naturesuch as thirst hunger wearinessinstead of pain they feel a lessen of pleasure and this prompt them to seek whatever it be that be need for their survival men pursue pleasure as eagerly as they avoid painor anyway they could have be so constitute that this be true of them so it seem clearly possible to carry on the business of life without any pain why then be any animal ever subject to such a sensation if animals can be free from it for an hour they could be free from it all the time and their be subject to pain be a positive fact about them not a mere absence of something it might have be impossible to provide it require a particular arrangement of their organs to produce pain just as it do to endow them with sight hear or any of the sense shall we conjecturewithout any appearance of reason for itthat such an arrangement be necessary and shall we build on that conjecture as we would on the most certain truth but a capacity for pain would not of itself produce pain if it werent for something else namely the worlds be govern by general laws and this seem to be in no way necessary for a very perfect be it be true that if each thing that happen be cause by an individual volition on gods part the course of nature would be perpetually break there would be no dependable regularities and so no man could employ his reason in the conduct of life but if some such volitions threaten to have that effect mightnt other particular volitions remedy this inconvenience in short might not god exterminate all misfortune wherever it be to be find and make everything all good through judiciously place individual volitions and thus without any preparation or long chain of cause and effect besides we should bear in mind that in the present arrangement of the world the course of nature though suppose to be entirely regular appear to us not to be so many events be uncertain and many disappoint our expectations countless kinds of happen whose cause be unknown and variablefor example health and sickness calm and tempesthave a great influence both on the fortunes of particular persons and on the prosperity of whole communities and indeed all human life depend in a way on such happen so a be who know the secret work of the universe might easily by particular volitions turn all these happen to the good of mankind and make the whole world happy without reveal himself in any operation a fleet whose purpose be useful to society might always meet with a fair wind good rulers might enjoy sound health and long life persons bear to power and authority might be endow with good temperaments and virtuous dispositions a few outcomes such as these regularly and wisely bring about would change the face of the world and yet they would no more seem to disturb the course of nature or thwart human conduct than do the present arrangement of things where the cause be secret and variable and complex some small touch give to caligulas brain in his infancy might have convert him into a trajan one wave a little higher than the rest by bury caesar and his fortune in the bottom of the ocean might have restore liberty to a considerable part of mankind there may for all we know be good reason why providence doesnt intervene in this manner but we dont know them and though the mere supposition that such reason exist may be sufficient to save the conclusion concern the divine attribute from be refute by the observe facts it can surely never be sufficient to establish that conclusion if everything in the universe be govern by general laws and if animals be make capable of pain it seem almost inevitable that some misfortune will arise in the various collisions of matter and the various agreements and clash between general laws but such misfortune would be very rare if it werent for the third of the four factor that i propose to mention it be the great frugality with which all power and abilities be distribute to every particular be the organs and capacities of all animals be so well organize and so well fit to their preservation thatjudging by history and traditionthere appear never yet to have be a species that be extinguish in the universe every animal have the endowments it need but these endowments be give out with such careful economygiving each creature only the bare necessities for its survivalthat if anything considerable be take away from them the creature be entirely destroy wherever one power be increase there be a proportional lessen of the others animals that excel in speed be commonly lack in strength those that have both be either imperfect in some of their sense or be oppress with the most crave want the human species whose chief excellence be reason and foresight have more need and fewer bodily advantage than any of the others think of how humans would be situate if they be without clothe without weapons without food without lodge without any convenience of life except what they owe to their own skill and hard work in short nature seem to have calculate exactly what her creatures need andlike a stern employerhas grant them little more than the power or endowments that be strictly sufficient to meet those need an indulgent parent would have provide a great deal extra so as to guard against unforeseen events and to secure the happiness and welfare of the creature in the worst crises he would not have leave us in a condition where every course of life be surround with precipices to such an extent that the least departure from the true pathwhether by mistake or by necessityis bind to involve us in misery and ruin some reserve some emergency fund would have be provide to ensure happiness and our power and our need wouldnt have be so strictly balance against each other the author of nature be inconceivably powerful his force be suppose to be great even if not limitless and theres no reason we can find why he should be so strictly frugal in his deal with his creatures if his power be extremely limit hed have do better to create fewer animals and to have endow these with more mean for be happy and stay alive a builder be never regard as prudent if he tackle a plan that he hasnt the materials to finish in order to remedy most of the misfortunes of human life i dont require that man should have the wing of the eagle the swiftness of the stag the force of the ox the arm of the lion the scale of the crocodile or rhinoceros much less do i demand the intelligence of an angel i will settle for an increase in one single power or capacity of his mind let him be endow with a greater like for work a more vigorous bounce and activity of mind a more constant tendency to get on with his business if the whole species possess naturally the same high level of diligence that many individuals cultivate in themselves the immediate and necessary result of this endowment would be the most beneficial consequences with no taint of anything bad almost all the moral evils of human life as well as its natural evils arise from idleness and if our species have be build so as to be inherently free of this vice or infirmity the immediate result would have be the perfect cultivation of land the improvement of arts and manufacture the exact performance of every office and duty and men would straight away have reach the state of society that as things be be only imperfectly achieve by the best regulate government but as hardworkingness be a power and indeed the most valuable of all the power nature seem to be determine to follow her usual policy and to bestow it on men with a very spar hand and to punish him severely for not have enough of it rather than to reward him for his achievements she have build him in such a way that nothing but the strongest need can force him to work and she exploit that fact in order to get him to work she use all his other want to overcome at least in part his lack of diligence thus endow him through hardship and need with some share of a faculty that she have deprive him of naturally here our demand can be agree to be very humble and thus all the more reasonable if we require the endowments of sharper intellect and wiser judgment of a more delicate taste for beauty of more sensitive feel of benevolence and friendship we might be tell that we be impiously claim to break the order of nature that we want to raise ourselves to a higher level of be that the gift that we ask for not be suitable to our state and condition would only bring us misery but it be hardi dare to repeat it it be hardthat when we be place in a world so full of want and necessities where almost every be and element be either our foe or refuse its assistance we should also have our own temperament to struggle with and should be deprive of the only facultynamely an inclination for hard workthat can protect us from these multiply evils the fourth factor lead to the misery and misfortune of the universe be the inaccurate workmanship of all the work and principles of the great machine of nature it must be admit that most part of the universe seem to serve some purpose and in most case the removal of a part would produce a visible defect and disorder in the whole the part all hang together and you cant change one without affect the rest more or less but at the same time it must be observe that none of these part or power however useful be so accurately adjust that they keep precisely within the limit of their usefulness all of them be apt much of the time to run to one extreme or the other this grand product the universe be so unfinished in every part and be carry out with such coarse brushstrokes that one would think that its maker hadnt yet put on its finish touch thus wind be need to blow away smoke and fog and noxious fume and to help men in navigation but often they grow to be tempests and hurricanes and then they become pernicious rain be necessary to nourish all the plant and animals of the earth but often there be droughts and often the rain be excessive heat be need for life and vegetation but isnt always find at the right level the health and prosperity of the animal depend on the make and mix of the fluids and juices of its body but the part of these fluids dont dependably perform their proper function the passions of the mindambition vanity love angerare extremely useful but they often overflow their bank and cause the greatest convulsions in society everything in the universe however advantageous frequently become pernicious through there be too much or too little of it and nature have not guard effectively against all disorder or confusion the irregularity be perhaps never so great as to destroy any species but be often sufficient to involve individuals in ruin and misery there be the four factor on which all or most natural evil depend if all live creatures be incapable of feel pain or if the world be govern by particular volitions evil never could have find its way into the universe and if animals be endow with a large stock of power and faculties beyond what they strictly need for survival or if the various spring and principles of the universe be so accurately devise as to preserve always the temperate middle level and not run to extremes there would have be very little misfortune compare to what we feel at present what then shall we say about all this shall we say that the universe could easily have be design so as to be different in these four respect this decision seem too presumptuous for creatures as blind and ignorant as we be let us be more modest in our conclusions let us allow that if the goodness of god i mean a goodness like human goodness could be establish by any respectable a priori argument these phenomena however unfortunate wouldnt be sufficient to undercut that principle of gods goodness for the phenomena might be easily reconcilable to it in some way we dont know about but we should still maintain that as gods goodness be not antecedently establish and have to be infer from the phenomena there can be no ground for such an inference when there be so many misfortunes in the universe and while these misfortunes couldas far as human understand can be allow to judge on such a subjecteasily have be remedied i be sceptic enough to allow that the bad appearances notwithstanding all my reason may be compatible with such divine attribute as you suppose but surely they can never prove these attribute the conclusion that god be good can not result from scepticism but must arise from the phenomena and from our confidence in the reason through which we draw conclusions from these phenomena look around this universe what an immense profusion of be animate and organize conscious and active you admire this prodigious variety and fruitfulness but look a little more closely at these live things the only ones worth think about how hostile and destructive they be to each other how far they all be from be able to achieve their own happiness how contemptible or odious they be to the spectator the whole picture be one of a blind nature impregnate by some powerful lifegiving force and pour forth from her lap without discernment or parental care her maim and abortive children here the manichaean systemaccording to which the universe be govern by two fundamental force one good and the other badcomes to mind as a good hypothesis to solve the difficulty no doubt it be in some respect very attractive and its give a plausible account of the strange mixture of good and ill that appear in life make it more probable than the common hypothesis of a single benevolent god but if on the other hand we think about the perfect uniformity and agreement of the part of the universe we shant discover in it any sign of a malevolent be battle against a benevolent one there be indeed an opposition of pain and pleasures in the feel of conscious creatures but arent all the operations of nature carry on by an opposition of force of hot and cold moist and dry light and heavy the true conclusion be that the original source of all things be entirely indifferent to all these force and no more prefer good above evil than heat above cold or drought above moisture or light above heavy four hypotheses can be form concern the first cause of the universe that they be endow with perfect goodness that they have perfect malice that they be opposite and have both goodness and malice that they have neither goodness nor malice mix phenomena can never prove the two former unmixed principles and the uniformity and steadiness of general laws seem to oppose the third the fourth therefore seem by far the most probablethat be that the first cause of the universe be neutral with regard to good and bad what i have say about natural evil also apply with little or no change to moral evil we have no more reason to infer that the uprightness of the supreme be resemble human uprightness than that his benevolence resemble human benevolence indeed it will be think that we have more reason to exclude from him moral feel such as ours because many people think that moral evil predominate over moral good more than natural evil above natural good but even if this be reject and even if the virtue that mankind have be acknowledge to be much superior to the vice still as long as there be any vice at all in the universe you anthropomorphites will be very puzzle over how to account for it you must assign a cause for it without bring in the first cause but every effect must have a cause and that cause must have another and so you must either carry on the sequence ad infinitum or bring it to an end with that original principle who be the ultimate cause of all things wait wait exclaim demea where be your imagination take you i ally myself with you in order to prove the incomprehensible nature of the divine be and to refute the principles of cleanthes who want to measure everything by human rule and standards but now i find you agree with all the view of the greatest libertines and infidels and betray that holy cause which you seem earlier to embrace be you secretly then a more dangerous enemy than cleanthes himself have it take you this long to see that reply cleanthes believe me demea your friend philo have from the outset be amuse himself at my expense and at yours and i must admit that the incautious reason of our common theology have give him all too good a handle for ridicule the total infirmity of human reason the absolute incomprehensibility of gods nature the great and universal misery and the still greater wickedness of menthese be strange theme surely to be so fondly cherish by orthodox churchmen and professors in age of stupidity and ignorance indeed these principles may safely be espouse and it may be that the best way to promote superstition be to encourage mankind in its blind bewilderment its lack of confidence its gloom but at present dont blame the trouble so much on the ignorance of these reverend gentlemen interrupt philo they know how to change their style with the time formerly it be a most popular line in theology to maintain that human life be empty and miserable and to exaggerate all the ills and pain that men undergo but in recent years we have find theologians begin to withdraw from this position and to maintain though still with some hesitation that even in this life there be more goods than evils more pleasures than pain when religion depend entirely on temperament and education it be think proper to encourage gloom for indeed men be most ready to appeal to superior power when they be feel gloomy but now that men have learn to form principles and draw conclusions so that religion depend on arguments rather than merely on how you feel and how you have be indoctrinate it be necessary to bring some different gun to bear and to make use of arguments that can survive at least some scrutiny and examination this change of tactics be the same and from the same cause as the one i formerly remark on with regard to scepticism in this way philo continue to the last his spirit of opposition and his condemnation of establish opinions but i could see that demea didnt at all like the last part of what he say and soon after that he make some excuse or other to leave the group after demeas departure cleanthes and philo continue the conversation in the follow manner our friend i be afraid say cleanthes wont be much incline to revive this topic of discussion in a group contain you and to tell you the truth philo on a subject that be so elevate and that matter so much i would prefer to reason with you or with demea alone your spirit of controversy join to your hatred of common superstition carry you to strange lengths when you be engage in an argument and on such an occasion you dont spare anything however sacred and venerable it be even in your own eye i must admit reply philo that i be less cautious on the subject of natural religion than on any other both because i know that i can never corrupt the principles concern religion of any man of common sense and because i be confident that noone who see me as a man of common sense will ever misunderstand my intentions you in particular cleanthes with whom i live in unreserved intimacyyou be aware that despite the freedom of my conversation and my love of unusual arguments noone have a deeper sense of religion impress on his mind than i do or offer more profound adoration to the divine be as he reveal himself to our reason in the inexplicable design and artfulness of nature the most careless the most stupid thinker see everywhere a purpose an intention a design and no man can be so harden in absurd systems as to reject that at all time that nature do nothing in vain be a maxim establish in all the universities merely on the strength of observe the work of nature without any religious purpose and from a firm conviction of its truth an anatomist who have observe a new organ or canal in an animal body would never be satisfy until he have also discover what it do and what it be for one great foundation of the copernican system be the maxim that nature act by the simplest methods and choose the most proper mean to any end and astronomers often without think of it lay this strong foundation stone on which can be erect the edifice of piety and religion the same thing be observable in other branch of learn and thus almost all the sciences lead us insensibly to acknowledge a first think author and their authority be often all the greater for the fact that they dont openly say that thats what they mean to do it be with pleasure that i hear galen reason concern the structure of the human body the anatomy of a man he say reveal more than different muscle and anyone who study these will find that in each of them nature must have take into account at least ten different circumstances in order to achieve the end that she propose right shape right size right disposition of the several end the upper and lower position of the whole muscle the proper insertion of the various nerve vein and arteries so that in the muscle alone more than different plan and intentions must have be form and carry out he calculate that there be bone and that the structure of each of them aim at more than forty purpose what an enormous display of plan even in these simple and homogeneous part but if we consider the skin ligaments bloodvessels glands bodily fluids the various limbs and members of the bodyhow our astonishment must increase in proportion to the number and intricacy of the part so artfully relate to one another as we go further in these research we discover new scenes of skill and wisdom but we can tell that further down the smallness scale there be yet other scenes beyond our perceptual reach in the fine internal structure of the part in the organization of the brain in the build of the seminal vessels all these devices be repeat in every different species of animal with wonderful variety and in each case exactly right for the intentions of nature in form the species in question and if galens irreligion couldnt withstand such strike appearances even when these natural sciences be still imperfect a scientist today must indeed be stubbornly obstinate if he can doubt that there be a supreme intelligence if i meet with one of this sort thank god they be very rare i would ask him suppose there be a god who didnt reveal himself immediately to our sensesenabling us to see or feel or hear himcould he possibly give stronger proof of his existence than the proof that do appear on the whole face of nature what indeed could such a divine be do but copy the present arrangement of things make many of his artifices so obvious that no stupidity could mistake them provide glimpse of still greater artifices that demonstrate his prodigious superiority above our narrow mind and conceal a great many of them altogether from such imperfect creatures as we be now accord to all rule of sound reason every factual proposition count as indisputable when it be support by all the arguments that its nature admit of even if those arguments arent in themselves very numerous or strong how much more this apply in the present case where no human imagination can compute the number of the arguments and no understand can take in how strong they be i shall add say cleanthes to what you have so well urge that one great advantage of the principle of theism be that its the only system of cosmogony that can be make intelligible and complete while also preserve throughout a strong analogy to what we see and experience in the world every day the comparison of the universe to a machine of human design be so obvious and natural and be justify by so many examples of order and design in nature that it must immediately occur to all unprejudiced mind and win universal approval whoever want to weaken this theory cant claim to succeed by establish in its place any other that be precise and determinate for there be no such rival it be sufficient for him if he raise doubt and difficulties and by remote and abstract view of things reach that suspense of judgment which on this topic be the most he can wish for but this state of mind as well as be in itself unsatisfactory can never be steadily maintain against such strike appearances as continually draw us into the religious hypothesis human nature be capable through the force of prejudice of obstinately persevere in a false absurd system but i think it be absolutely impossible to maintain or defend have no system at all in opposition to a theory that be support by strong and obvious reason by natural propensity and by early education i have so little respect for this suspension of judgment about the existence of god say philo that im incline to suspect that this controversy be more of a verbal dispute than be usually imagine that the work of nature be very like the products of human ingenuity be evident and accord to all the rule of good reason we ought to inferif we argue at all about themthat their cause be correspondingly alike but as there be also considerable differences between the work of nature and human products we have reason to suppose that their cause be correspondingly unalike and that in particular we ought to attribute a much higher degree of power and energy to the supreme cause than to any we have ever observe in mankind here then the existence of a god be plainly discover by reason and if there be a question as to whether these analogies entitle us to call him a mind or intelligence give the vast difference that can reasonably be suppose to exist between him and human mind what be this but a mere verbal controversy no man can deny the liken between the effect to hold back from enquire about the cause be scarcely possible from this enquiry the legitimate conclusion be that the cause be also alike in some respect and if we arent content with call the first and supreme cause only a god or deity but want to find other word to apply to him what can we call him but mind or think give that he be justly suppose to bear a considerable resemblance to mind all sensible people be annoy by verbal dispute which occur so often in philosophical and theological enquiries and it be find that the only remedy for this misuse of language come from clear definitions from the precision of the ideas that enter into any argument and from strictly keep to the mean of the term one use but there be one sort of controversy which from the very nature of language and of human ideas be involve in perpetual ambiguity and can never by any precaution or any definitions reach a reasonable certainty or precision these be the controversies about the degrees of any quality or circumstance be hannibal a great or a very great or a superlatively great man how beautiful be cleopatra what term of praise be livy or thucydides entitle to men may argue to all eternity about such question without ever settle on agree answer the disputants may here agree in what they think and differ in the word they useor vice versaand yet never be able to define their term so as to understand each others mean thats because the degrees of these qualities unlike quantity or number cant be measure on any exact scale that could be the standard in the controversy the slightest enquiry reveal that the dispute concern theism be of this nature and consequently be merely verbalor perhaps still more incurably ambiguous if that be possible i ask the theist if he doesnt agree that the difference between the human mind and the divine mind be great and because it be incomprehensible immeasurable and the more pious he be the readier he will be to agree and the more he will be dispose to magnify the difference he will even assert that the difference be so great that it would be impossible to exaggerate how great it be i next turn to the atheistwho i say be only nominally an atheist and cant possibly be seriously soand i ask him whether judge by the coherence and apparent coordination among all the part of this world there isnt a certain similarity among all the operations of nature in every situation and in every agewhether the rot of a turnip the come into existence of an animal and the structure of human think be not energies that probably bear some remote analogy to each otherand he cant possibly deny it indeed he will readily acknowledge it have obtain this concession from him i push the selfdescribed atheist back still further i ask him if it isnt likely that the source that first order this universe in general and still keep it in order bear also some remote and hardtograsp analogy to the particular operations of nature include the arrangements that produce the human mind and think however reluctantly he must say yes then i ask both these antagonists what be you argue about the theist allow that the original intelligence be very different from human reason the atheist allow that the original source of order bear some remote analogy to it will you quarrel gentlemen about the degrees of difference and of similarity and enter into a controversy that cant be make precise and thus cant be settle if you be to persist obstinately i wouldnt be surprise to find you unknowingly change sidesthe theist exaggerate the dissimilarity between the supreme be and frail imperfect variable fleet and mortal creatures while the atheist exaggerate the similarity that there be among all the operations of nature at every time and in every place and circumstance consider then what you be really disagree about and if you cant set aside the disagreement at least realize that it concern the place of certain dissimilarities on a scale for which there be no precise measure and thus try to cure yourselves of your hostility to one another and here i must also acknowledge cleanthes that as the work of nature be more like the effect of our skill and plan than they be like the effect of our benevolence and justice we have reason to infer that gods nonmoral attribute have a greater resemblance to those of men than his moral attribute have to human virtues but what follow from that only that man moral qualities be more defective in their kind than be his nonmoral abilitiesfor example that man justice be a worse sample of justice than his cleverness be a sample of cleverness for it be agree that god be absolutely and entirely perfect so whatever differ most from him depart the furthest from the supreme standard of moral uprightness and perfection these cleanthes be my undisguised view on this subject and you know that i have uphold and value them for a long time but my veneration for true religion be match by my abhorrence of common superstitions and i admit that i get a special pleasure out of push superstitionssometimes into absurdity sometimes into impiety all bigots hate impiety more than they do absurdity but as you be well aware they be often equally guilty of both my inclination reply cleanthes lie in a different direction religion however corrupt be still better than no religion at all the doctrine of a future state be so strong and necessary a security to morals that we never ought to abandon or neglect it for if finite and temporary reward and punishments have such a great effect as we daily find that they do how much greater must be expect from reward and punishments that be infinite and eternal if common superstition be so good for society say philo then how do it happen that history be so full of account of its pernicious effect on public affairs factions civil war persecutions subversions of government oppression slaverythese be the dismal consequences which always accompany a prevalence of superstition in the mind of men whenever an historical narrative mention the religious spirit we be sure to find later in the story some detail of the miseries that come with it no period of time can be happier or more prosperous than those in which the religious spirit be never honour or hear of it seem obvious that the dispute between the sceptics and dogmatists be entirely verbal or at any rate it only concern how much doubt or assurance we should have in all our reason and dispute about that be often basically verbal and cant be definitively settle no philosophical dogmatist deny that there be difficulties both with regard to the sense and to all science and that these difficulties absolutely can not be resolve in a regular logical manner no sceptic deny that we despite these difficulties can not get out of think and believe and reason with regard to all kinds of subject or of often assent to things with confidence and security so the only difference between these sects if that be what they be be that the scepticfrom habit whim or inclinationinsists most on the difficulties the dogmatist for like reason insist on the necessity the reason for this reply cleanthes be obvious the proper role of religion be to regulate the heart of men humanize their conduct infuse the spirit of temperance order and obedience and as it work silently and only strengthen the motives of morality and justice it be in danger of be overlook and be confuse with those other motives when religion call attention to itself and act as a separate motive force in meninstead of be only a good influence on all the other motive forcesit have leave its proper sphere and have become only a cover for faction and ambition and so will all religion say philo except the philosophical and rational kind your reason be easier to escape from than be my facts because finite and temporary reward and punishments have so great influence therefore infinite and eternal ones must have so much greaterthis reason be not sound consider i beg you how much we care about present things and how little concern we express for object as remote and uncertain as the reward or punishments promise in the afterlife when preachers declaim against the common behaviour and conduct of the world they always represent this principle of concern for what be close as the strongest imaginable which indeed it be and they describe most of mankind as lie under its influence and sink into the deepest lethargy and lack of concern for their religious interest yet these same religious spokesmen defend religion against attack take the motives of religion to be so powerful that civil society couldnt survive without them and they arent ashamed of this obvious contradiction experience show us for sure that the smallest grain of natural honesty and benevolence have more effect on mens conduct than the most grandly inflate view suggest by theological theories and systems a man natural inclination work on him all the time it be always present to his mind and mingle itself with every view and consideration whereas religious motives where they act at all operate only by fit and start and it be scarcely possible for them to become altogether habitual to the mind the force of the greatest gravitational pull say the physicists be incomparably smaller than the force of the least push yet it be certain that the smallest gravity will eventually prevail over a large push because no stroke or blow can be repeat with such constancy as attraction and gravitation another advantage that inclination have in the tussle with duty it bring into play on its side all the sharpness and ingenuity of the mind and when it be place in opposition to religious principles it seek every method and device for elude themand it nearly always succeed who can explain the heart of man or account for those strange specialpleadings and excuse with which people let themselves off when they be follow their inclinations in opposition to their religious duty this be well understand in the world and only fool would trust a man less because they hear that study and philosophy have give him some speculative doubt with regard to theological subject and when we have deal with a man who make a great profession of religion and devotion doesnt this put many sensible people on their guard against be cheat and deceive by him we must further consider that philosophers who cultivate reason and reflection have less need of such religious motives to keep them under the restraint of morals and that common peoplethe only ones who may need religion to keep them in ordercant possibly have a religion so pure that it represent god as be please with nothing but virtue in human behaviour pleas for gods favour be generally understand to be either frivolous observances or rapturous ecstasies or a bigoted credulity and therefore not to reflect or to encourage moral seriousness we neednt go back to ancient time or wander into remote place to find instance of this degeneracy of religion divorce from morality amongst ourselves some people have be guilty of something atrocious that even the egyptian and greek superstitions be not guilty of namely speak out explicitly against morality say that if one put the least trust or reliance in morality one will certainly lose favour with god and even if superstition or fanaticism didnt put itself in direct opposition to morality it would still have the most pernicious consequences greatly weaken mens attachment to the natural motives of justice and humanity it would do this because of its divert of the attention away from morality its raise up of a new and frivolous sort of suppose merit and the preposterous way in which it distribute praise and blame such a religious actiondriver not be one of the familiar motives of human conduct act only intermittently on a persons temperament and it have to be rouse by continual efforts in order to render the pious zealot satisfy with his own conduct and make him fulfil his devotional task many religious exercise be begin with seem fervour although the persons heart at the time feel cold and apathetic he gradually acquire a habit of cover up his true feel and fraud and falsehood eventually become the predominant force in his mind this explain the common observation that the highest zeal in religion and the deepest hypocrisy so far from be inconsistent be often or usually unite in the same individual person the bad effect of such habit even in ordinary everyday life be easily imagine but where the interest of religion be concern no morality can be strong enough to constrain the fanatical zealot the sacredness of his causehe thinkssanctifies anything that he do to promote it steadily and exclusively attend to something as important to oneself as eternal salvation be apt to extinguish ones benevolent feel and to generate a narrow contract selfishness and when such a temperament be encourage it easily elude all the general precepts of charity and benevolence thus the motives of common superstition have no great influence on general conduct and where they do predominate their influence be not favourable to morality be any maxim in politics more certain and infallible than the one say that the number and the authority of priests should be confine within very narrow limit and that the civil magistrate ought never to allow the instrument of his authority fall into such dangerous hand as those of priests but if the spirit of popular religion the religion of ordinary people be as salutary to society as its defenders say it be a contrary maxim ought to prevail reflect a line of think like the follow the more priests there be in law and government the better a greater number of priests and their greater authority and riches will always increase the religious spirit and though the priests have the guidance of this spirit we can expect them also to develop ever greater moral decency in their feel why should we not expect a superior sanctity of life and greater benevolence and moderation from people who be set apart for religion who be continually preach it to others and who must themselves imbibe a greater share of it then how do it come about that in fact the most that a wise ruler can propose with regard to popular religions be as far as possible to make a save game of it to minimize losses without expect any gain and to prevent their pernicious consequences with regard to society every mean he use to carry out this modest purpose be surround with inconvenience if he allow only one religion among his subject he must sacrifice every consideration of public liberty science reason industry and even his own independenceall this in return for an uncertain prospect of religious peace if he allow several sects which be the wiser course for him to follow he must preserve a very philosophical evenhandedness regard all of them and carefully restrain the claim of the dominant sect otherwise he can expect nothing but endless dispute quarrel factions persecutions and civil commotions true religion i admit have no such pernicious consequences but we have to concern ourselves not with true religion but with religion as it have commonly be find in the world and i be not discuss the speculative thesis of theism be a philosophical theory it must share in the beneficial influence of philosophy while also suffer from philosophys drawback of be accept by very few people oaths be require in all court of law but do their authority arise from any popular religion i say no the chief restraints on mankind be the solemnity and importance of the occasion a concern for ones reputation and reflection on the general interest of society customhouse oaths declarations about what one be import or export and political oaths be not regard as bind even by some who claim to abide by principles of honesty and religion and we rightly put a quakers assertion on the same foot as the oath of any other person i know that polybius ascribe the notorious untrustworthiness of the greeks to the prevalence of the epicurean philosophy but i know also that carthaginian promise have as bad a reputation in ancient time as irish testimony do today and we cant account for these general impressions in the same way namely the influence of epicurean philosophy not to mention that the greeks be already notoriously untrustworthy before the rise of the epicurean philosophy and euripides have aim a remarkable stroke of satire against his nation with regard to trustworthiness take care philo reply cleanthes take care dont push matter too far dont allow your zeal against false religion to undermine your reverence for the true dont give up this religious principle which be the chief the only great comfort in life and our principal support amidst all the attack of adverse fortune the most agreeable reflection that the human imagination can possibly suggest be that of genuine theism which represent us as the workmanship of a be who be perfectly good wise and powerful a be who create us to be happy and who have implant in us immeasurable desire for good things will prolong our existence to all eternity take us into an infinite variety of scenes in order to satisfy those desire and make our happiness complete and last to be under the guardianship and protection of such a divine be be the happiest prospect we can imaginesecond only if this comparison be permissible to the happiness of the divine be himself that picture of how a person seem to relate to religion say philo be most engage and allure and when the person be a true philosopher it be more than just seem but here as before with regard to the greater part of mankind the appearances be deceitful and the terrors of religion commonly prevail over its comfort it be common knowledge that men never seek help from devotion so readily as when they be deject with grief or depress by sickness doesnt that show that the religious spirit be not so closely tie to joy as it be to sorrow but when men be afflict they find consolation in religion reply cleanthes sometimes say philo but it be natural to imagine that when they apply themselves to the contemplation of those unknown beingsthe gods of their religionthey will form a notion of them that be suitable to their own present gloom and melancholy accordingly we find in every religion that the image of god as fearsome predominate over all the other image of him and we ourselves after use the most exalt language in our descriptions of god fall into the flattest contradiction when we affirm that the damn infinitely outnumber those who be choose to be save i venture to assert that there have never be a popular religion which represent the state of depart souls in such a way as to make it a good thing from the human point of view that there should be such a state these fine model of religion that you speak of so cheerfully cleanthes be the mere product of philosophy and get no grip on the ordinary thoughts and feel of ordinary people when plain folk try to imagine the afterlife death intervene between the mind eye and the object and death be so shock to nature that it throw a gloom on all the regions that lie on the far side of it and suggest to the general run of people the idea of cerberus and furies devil and torrents of fire and brimstone it be true that both fear and hope enter into religion because both those passions agitate the human mind from time to time and each of them form a kind of divinity suitable to itself but when a man be in a cheerful frame of mind he be fit for business or company or entertainment of any kind and he naturally turn his attention to these and doesnt think of religion when gloomy and deject on the other hand he hasnt the spirit or energy to apply himself to anything in this world so all he can do be to brood on the terrors of the afterworld and thus make his condition worse than ever it may indeed happen that after he have in this way engrave the religious opinions deep into his think and imagination some change of health or circumstances restore his goodhumour and raise cheerful prospect of the afterlife send him to the other extreme of joy and triumph but still it must be admit that as terror be the drive force of religion it be the passion that always predominate in it and allow for only short periods of pleasure a further point these bouts of excessive extravagant joy by exhaust the spirit always prepare the way for equal bouts of superstitious terror and dejection the happiest state of mind be not frenzied joy but balance calm but it be impossible for a man to remain long in that state when he think that he lie in such profound darkness and uncertainty between an eternity of happiness and an eternity of misery no wonder that such an opinion unhinge the ordinary frame of the mind and throw it into the utmost confusion and though that opinion be seldom so steady in its operation that it influence all the persons action it be apt to make considerable inroads on his temperament and to produce the gloom and melancholy that be so noticeable in all devout people it be contrary to common sense to be anxious or terrify about what may happen to us in the afterlife on account of any opinion that we have or to imagine that the freest use of our reason will run us into any risk in the hereafter such a view imply both an absurdity and an inconsistency it be an absurdity to believe that god have human passions and indeed one of the lowest of them namely a restless appetite for applause it be an inconsistency to believe that god have this human passion but doesnt have others also and especially a disregard for the opinions of creatures so much inferior to know god say seneca be to worship him all other worshipthat be all worship that go beyond express ones knowledge that god existsis indeed absurd superstitious and even impious it degrade god to the low condition of ordinary men who be delight to be approach with entreaties request present and flattery yet this be the least of the impieties of which superstition be guilty commonly superstition push god down to a level far below that of mankind and represent him as a capricious demon who exercise his power without reason and without humanity if god be incline to be offend at the vices and follies of silly mortals who be his own workmanship the devote of most popular superstitions would be in for a very bad time none of the human race would deserve his favour except for a very few the philosophical theists who haveor at any rate try to havesuitable notions of his divine perfections and the only persons entitle to his compassion and leniency would be the philosophical sceptics an almost equally small sect whose natural modesty about their own capacities lead them to suspendor try to suspendall judgment with regard to such sublime and extraordinary subject if the whole of natural theology as some people seem to maintain boil down to one simple though somewhat ambiguous or at least undefined proposition the cause or cause of order in the universe probably bear some remote analogy to human intelligence if this proposition cant be extend vary or explain in more detail if it yield no inference that affect human life or can be the source of any action or forbearance from act and if the analogy imperfect as it be extend only to human intelligence and cant plausibly be transfer to the other qualities of the mindif all this really be the case what can the most curious thoughtful and religious man do except give a plain philosophical assent to the proposition as often as it come up and believe that the arguments on which it be base outweigh the objections against it he will naturally feel somewhat unnerve by the greatness of the object that be by the think of the cause of the universe somewhat sad that the object be hide from him somewhat contemptuous of human reason for its inability to make a better job of such an extraordinary and magnificent question but believe me cleanthes the most natural feel that a welldisposed mind will have on this occasion be a long desire and expectation hum phrase that god will be please to remove or at least to lessen this profound ignorance by give mankind some particular revelation reveal the nature attribute and operations of the divine object of our faith a person who have a sound sense of the imperfections of natural reason will eagerly fly to reveal truth while the haughty dogmatist persuade that he can erect a complete system of theology with no help but that of philosophy will disdain any further aid and will reject this help from the outside to be a philosophical sceptic be in a man of letter the first and most essential step towards be a sound believe christian a proposition which i would willingly recommend to the attention of pamphilus and i hope cleanthes will forgive me for interpose so far in the education and instruction of his pupil cleanthes and philo do not pursue this conversation much further and as nothing ever make greater impression on me than all the reason of that day so i confess that on carefully look over the whole conversation i can not help think that philos principles be more probable than demeas but that those

which the author have project before he leave college and which he write and publish soon after it wasnt a success and he come to realize that he have go to the press too early so he rework the whole thing in the follow piece in which he hop to have correct some fault in his earlier reason and more in his write the enquiry concern human understand the dissertation on the passions and the present work be publish in one volume yet several writers who have honour the author philosophy with answer have take care to aim all their gun at that juvenile work which the author have never acknowledge and have gloat over victories that they imagine they have win against it that be dishonest and unfair and a strike example of the polemical trick that a bigoted zeal think it be entitle to employ from now on the author want the follow piece to be regard as the only source for his philosophical sentiments and principles in hum day a sentiment could be a viewopinionbelief or a feel why not replace each occurrence of sentiment by belief or by feel as be appropriate in the give context for two reason hume sometimes seem to make sentiment sprawl across both its mean some things that many people regard as beliefs be in hum view really feel and with a give occurrence of sentiment its not always clear how far he mean to be show his hand just there so in this version sentiment be never replace in case whereas on page it be both sure and important that it mean feel that be indicate by the addition of or feel the general source of morals the dispute that one have with men who be stubbornly obstinate in their principles be the most tiresome of all except perhaps for the dispute with perfectly insincere people who dont really believe the opinions they defend but engage in the controversy because they enjoy it or because they want to show how much cleverer and more ingenious they be than the rest of mankind both kinds of disputant show the same blind adherence to their own arguments the same contempt for their opponents and the same emotional intensity in push their bad arguments and false doctrines neither kind get through reason the view he be defend so its no use expect to be able to move them from falsehood to truth by reason the only logic theyll be move by be the logic that speak to the feel those who have deny the reality of moral distinctions can be classify among the insincere disputants it simply isnt conceivable that any human be could ever seriously believe that all kinds of people and all kinds of behaviour be equally entitle to everyones affection and regard nature will make one man so different from another and this difference be make so much greater still by upbringing example and habit that when we compare the two men we have to be aware of how unalike they be that they be somewhat different couldnt be question by the most thorough sceptic or deny by the most confident dogmatist however numb a person be with regard to his fellow men he must often be visit by thoughts of right and wrong and however firmly wed he be to his prejudice he must be aware that the other people be also give to such thoughts so the only way to convert an antagonist of this kindie one who deny that there be moral differences between man and manis to leave him to himself when he find that nobody be will to argue with him he will probably end upout of sheer boredomcoming over to the side of common sense and reason a serious controversy have start up recentlyone that be worth engage inabout the general foundation of morals be morals derive from reason or from sentiment or feel do we get our knowledge of them by a chain of argument and induction or by an immediate feel and finer internal sense should moral opinions like all sound judgments of truth and falsehood be the same for every rational intelligent be or be they like the perception of beauty and ugliness base entirely on the particular makeup of the human species the ancient philosophers often assert that virtue be nothing but conformity to reason but their write generally suggest that they think that morals derive their existence from taste and sentiment and on the other side our modern enquirers talk a great deal about the beauty of virtue and ugliness of vice seem to imply that their basis be sentiment or feel but they have commonly try to account for the virtuevice distinction by metaphysical reason and by deductions from the most abstract principles of the understand there have be so much confusion in these subject that a really important opposition between two systems could pass unnoticeduntil recently that be the elegant lord shaftesbury who first call this distinction to our attention and who in general accept the principles of the ancients be himself not entirely free from the same confusion admittedly there be plausible arguments on both side of the question on the side of the view that moral distinctions be discernible by pure reason there be this line of think consider the many disputesin everyday life as well as in philosophyregarding morals the long chain of proof that be often produce on both side the examples cite the authorities appeal to the analogies employ the fallacies detect the inferences draw and the various conclusions tailor to fit the principles they be suppose to go with where do all this come from if morals arent in the domain of reason truth be disputable taste isnt what exist in the nature of things be the standard of our judgment what each man feel within himself be the standard of sentiment or feel a note on the two side of the contrast hume be draw here in his time judgment could stand for think that p come to the conclusion that p believe that p there be nothing specially moral about the word mean as there be for us when for example we describe someone as judgmental this be a place where sentiment clearly mean feel and not belief see note on page these two point together help to explain why this work could not have be entitle an enquiry into the source of moral judgments proposition in geometry can be prove systems in physics can be controvert but the harmony of verse the tenderness of passion the brilliancy of wit must give immediate pleasure no man reason about someone elses beauty but we often reason concern the justice or injustice of someones action in every criminal trial the prisoner aim to disprove the accusations about what he have actually do and to show that even if these action be real they could be justify as innocent and lawful everyone know that be settle by deductions of the understand how can we suppose that in settle a different faculty of the mind be employ on the other side those who hold that all moral view be matter of sentiment may say things like this it be impossible for reason ever to draw moral conclusions the essence of virtue be that it be amiable here lovable the essence of vice be that it be odious could reason or argumentation tell us which items be to be label amiable and which odioussettling in advance that this must produce love and that must produce hatred what reason can we ever give for the facts about what we love and what we hate except the basic structure of the human mind the purpose of all moral theorize be to teach us our duty and by present the ugliness of vice and the beauty of virtue to get us into the habit of avoid one and embrace the other could we ever expect to achieve that through inferences and conclusions of the understand which dont in themselves have any hold on our affections and dont set in motion our active power inferences etc reveal truths but they cant influence our behaviour because the truths they reveal be indifferent and dont create either desire or aversion here and in the next paragraph indifferent mean not involve any kind of for or against if something be honourable fair appropriate noble or generous it take possession of the heart and stir us to embrace and maintain it on the other hand if something be intelligible evident probable or true that procure only the cool assent of our understand if you extinguish all the warm feel and attitudes in favour of virtue and all disgust or aversion to vice thus make people totally indifferent towards these distinctions the result will be that morality be no longer a practical study have no tendency to regulate our live and action these arguments and many more that might be produce be so plausible that im incline to suspect that the arguments on both side be solid and satisfactory and that reason and sentiment work together in almost all moral judgments and conclusions but if i be right they enter the picture in different ways there be the final judgment which pronounce people and action amiable or odious praiseworthy or blameable stamp on them the mark of honour or infamy approval or censure render morality an active principle and make virtue our happiness and vice our misery this final moral conclusion depend on some internal sense or feel that nature have make universal in the whole species for only a feel could have an influence such as i have describe but we often find that in order to reach this sentiment or feel and to pick out accurately the thing the feel be about we have to go through much reason make fine distinctions draw sound conclusions compare things that be not greatly alike examine complicate relations and settle various factual matter some sort of beauty especially natural beauty command our affection and approval when we first see them and if something doesnt have this effect theres no way for reason to remedy the situation and make the item in question more in tune with our taste and sentiment but there be many kinds of beauty especially in the finer arts where one have to use much reason if one be to have the right feel and a wrong like for a work of art can often be correct by argument and reflection there be good reason to think that moral beauty be of the latter kind and cant get a suitable influence on the human mind unless it get help from our intellectual faculties but although this question about which of our faculties be at work in morals be challenge and important i dont need to go into it any further here what i do want to do in this enquiry be to discover the true origin of morals if i have the good fortune to succeed in that it wont be hard to see how far either sentiment or reason enter into all our moral judgment ill return to that in appendix to achieve my purpose ill try to follow a very simple method i shall analyse the complex of mental qualities that we commonly call personal merit i shall consider every attribute of mind that make a man an object either of respect and affection or of hatred and contempt every habit or sentiment or ability which if ascribe to any person imply either praise or blame everyone be alert to this difference so i be pretty sure that i wont ever go seriously wrong in draw up my list put any item that i be think about into the wrong list all i need do be to look into myself for a moment and consider whether i would want to have this or that quality ascribe to me and whether if it be ascribe to me that would come from a friend or from an enemy the very nature of language guide us almost infallibly in form a judgment of this kind every language contain one set of word that be understand as approve and another set that be understand as disapprove and a quite casual acquaintance with the idiom enable us to collect and arrange the list of estimable and of blameable qualities of men without have to reason about what we be do the only role of reason in this matter be to discover what be in common to the attribute that bring approval and what be common to all that bring disapproval and on that basis to reach the foundation of ethics and find the universal source from which all blame or approval be ultimately derive as this be a question of fact not of abstract theory the only way we can expect to succeed be by follow the experimental method derive general maxims from a comparison of particular instance the other scientific method in which a general abstract principle be first establish and then a variety of inferences and conclusions be draw from it may be intrinsically better but it isnt as well suit to the imperfection of human nature and be a common source of illusion and error in morals as well as in other subject men be now cure of their passion for hypotheses and systems in natural philosophy natural science and wont listen to any arguments that arent derive from experience its high time they try a similar reformation in all moral proceed and reject every system of ethics however subtle or ingenious that isnt base on fact and observation i shall begin my enquiry by consider the social virtues benevolence and justice get clear about them will probably give us an open through which the other virtues can be account for benevolence how benevolence be value you may well think that there be no need to show that the benevolent or softer affections be estimable and always attract the approval and goodwill of mankind all languages have equivalents of the word sociable goodnatured humane merciful grateful friendly generous and beneficent and such word always express the highest merit that human nature can attain when these amiable qualities be accompany by noble birth and power and distinguish abilities and display themselves in the good government or useful instruction of mankind they seem even to raise the possessors of them above the rank of human nature make them somewhat approach the status of divine great ability undaunted courage tremendous successthese may expose a hero or politician to the publics envy and illwill but as soon as humane and beneficent be add to the praiseswhen instance be display of mercy gentleness or friendshipenvy itself be silent or join in with the general voice of approval and applause when pericles the great athenian statesman and general be on his deathbed his surround friendsthinking he be unconsciousbegan to express their sorrow by list their die patrons great qualities and successes his conquests and victories his unusually long time in power and his nine trophies erect to celebrate victories over the enemies of the republic in fact the die hero be conscious hear all of this and join in you be forget the highest of my praise while dwell on those common advantage in which luck have a principal share you havent observe that no citizen ever wear mourn because of me in men of more ordinary talents and abilities the social virtues become if possible still more essentially need if a person be to be regard with approval because in that case there be no high distinction to compensate for any lack of social virtues or to preserve the person from our severest hatred as well as contempt cicero have write that high ambition and great courage be apt in less perfect character to degenerate into a turbulent ferocity what such less perfect people mainly need be the softer and more social virtues which be good and amiable in anyone who have them accord to the latin writer venal what be chiefly good about someones have great power and abilities be that this make his benevolence more extensive give him greater opportunities to spread his kindly influence than lesser men have let us face it the only way a man can truly enjoy the advantage of be distinguish in other ways be by do good his high position in itself merely expose him to danger and tempest his only real privilege be his ability to provide shelter to inferiors who entrust themselves to his cover and protection but im forget that its not my present business to recommend generosity and benevolence or to paint in their true colour all the genuine charm of the social virtues these virtues sufficiently engage every heart when they be first understand and its hard not to break out in praise of them whenever they crop up in discourse or reason but my object here be the theoretical rather than the practical part of morals so ill just say this expect everyone to agree no qualities be more entitle to the general goodwill and approval of mankind than beneficence and humanity friendship and gratitude natural affection and public spirit or anything that come from a tender sympathy with others and a generous concern for mankind in general whenever these appear they seem to inject themselves so to speak into each beholder cause him to have some of these the same favourable and affectionate sentiments throughout this work hume use sympathy in its basic original sense of fellowfeeling in this sense of the word i can have sympathy with you in your happiness orsee contagion and sympathy on page be irritable in sympathy with your bad temper benevolence and utility when we be praise a humane and beneficent man we always emphasize the happiness and satisfaction that society get from his good work we be apt to say that he be dear to his parent not only because of the tie of blood but also and more because of his pious attachment to them and his dutiful care for them his children never feel his authority except when it be exert for their benefit with him the tie of love be consolidate by beneficence and friendship the tie of friendship approach those of love and inclination because of the spirit in which he do good things for his friends for his servants and dependents he be a sure resource and they no longer dread the power of fortune except insofar as it concern his welfare from him the hungry receive food the naked receive clothe the ignorant or lazy receive skill and work he be like the sun in be an inferior minister subordinate agent of providence he cheer invigorate and sustain the world around him if he be confine to private life his sphere of activity be smaller but his influence be all benign and gentle if he be exalt into a higher position mankind and posterity reap the fruit of his labour these modes of praise be always employ and with success when we want to inspire esteem for someone cant we infer from this that the utility result from the social virtuesthe good that be do under their influence be at least a part of their merit and be one source of the approval and respect that everyone give to them when we recommend even an animal or a plant as useful and beneficial we applaud and praise it in a manner suit to its nature just as on the other hand when we think about the harmful influence of any kind of plant or animal this always create in us a sentiment or feel of aversion the eye be please with the view of cornfields and load vineyards horse graze and flock pasture but it avoid the view of briars and brambles that provide shelter for wolves and snake if a machine or piece of furniture or article of clothe or house be well design for use and convenience to that extent it be beautiful and be contemplate with pleasure and approval with this kind of thing an experience eye will detect many excellences that ignorant and uninstructed people would miss can anything stronger be say in praise of an occupationsuch as merchandise or manufacture than to point out the good it do for society and wont a monk or an inquisitor be enrage if we treat his religious organisation as useless or harmful to mankind the historian rejoice in display the benefit arise from his labour the writer of romance do what he can to lessen or deny the bad consequences that be ascribe to the kind of thing he write in general what praise be imply in the simple epithet useful what reproach in the contrary cicero in opposition to the epicureans say your gods be not entitle to any worship or adoration whatever imaginary perfections you endow them with they be totally useless and inactive even the egyptians whom you so much ridicule never treat any animal as sacred except on account of its utility the sceptics assert that the all religious worship originate from the utility of inanimate object such as the sun and moon to the support and wellbeing of mankind this be an absurd theory of the origin of religion but its sheer existence support my thesis about the central place of utility doinggood bringingbenefit to our approval and admiration this be also the reason that historians commonly give for the deification of eminent heroes and legislators to plant a tree to cultivate a field to beget children these be all meritorious act accord to the religion of zoroaster empirical evidence of failures of benevolence in moral judgments this matter of public utility be always centrally in view and whenever everyday or philosophical dispute arise concern the limit of duty by far the most certain way of settle the dispute question be to ascertain how each side of it relate to the true interest of mankind if we find that a misread of the evidence have lead us to accept a false opinion about human interest as soon as further experience and sounder reason have give us a more correct view of the facts we retract our first sentiment and readjust the line between moral good and evil here be four examples of this kind of shift in moral opinion give alms to common beggar be naturally praise because it seem to bring relief to those who be poor and distress but when we see that almsgiving encourage idleness and debauchery we regard that kind of charity as a weakness rather than a virtue tyrannicide ie the assassination of usurpers and oppressive rulers be highly praise in ancient time because it free mankind from many of these monsters and seem to keep in awe other rulers who couldnt be reach by the sword or the dagger but history and experience have since convince us that this practice make rulers more suspicious and cruel so that a tiberius and a brutes two highminded killers of their rulers though treat with indulgence because of the prejudice of their time be now regard as not people to imitate generosity in rulers be regard as a sign of beneficence but when it have the result that the homely bread of honest and hardworking people be often convert into luxuryfoods for wasteful idlers we soon retract our thoughtless praise the regret of a monarch for have lose a day be noble and generous but if he have intend to spend the day in act of generosity to his greedy courtiers it be better lose than misuse in that way luxury or a refinement on the pleasures and conveniences of life have for a long time be regard as the source of every corruption in government and the ultimate cause of faction sedition civil war and the total loss of liberty hume write the immediate cause etc presumably a slip so it be see by everyone as a vice and be attack by all satirists and severe moralists those who show or try to show that such refinements tend to increase industry civility and arts be offer new rule for our moral as well as our political sentiments represent as praiseworthy or at least as innocent behaviour that have formerly be regard as harmful and blameable this refer to mandevilles fable of the be private vices public benefit take all of this together it seem undeniable that nothing can bestow more merit on any person that his have a very high degree of the sentiment of benevolence and that at least a part of the merit of this sentiment come from its probable consequences for the interest of our species and the happiness of human society when we think about a benevolent person we carry our view of his character and disposition forward to their good consequences and we look with satisfaction and pleasure at anything that have such a benign influence and contribute to such a desirable end the social virtues be never view as barren and unfruitful we always think of them along with their beneficial tendencies see their gentle reign over the hearts of men as a cause of the happiness of mankind the order of society the harmony of families the mutual support of friends how much of their merit ought we to ascribe to their utility ill be better place to answer that when some other things have be deal with section and why do the good consequences of the social virtues have such a command over our esteem and approval i shall address that in justice the proposition that justice be useful to society and thus at least part of its merit must come from that fact doesnt need to be argue for because it be so obviously true not so the proposition that public utility be the sole origin of justice and thoughts about its beneficial consequences be the sole basis for its merit this proposition be more challenge and important so it better deserve to be look into with care justice and abundance let suppose that nature have give the human race such a profuse abundance of all external conveniences that all of us without any care or industry on our part can be confident that we be fully supply with whatever our hungriest appetites can want or our most luxurious imagination can wish or desire let us suppose that man be so situate that his natural beauty surpass all acquire ornament the perpetual mildness of the season make clothe unnecessary raw fruit and vegetables provide delicious food the clear fountain provide the richest beverage no hard work be neededno plough no navigation music poetry and meditate be his only business conversation fun and friendship be his sole amusement it seem clear that in such a happy state every other social virtue would flourish and be increase tenfold but the cautious jealous virtue of justice would never once have be dream of what point would there be in divide up goods when everyone already have more than enough why institute property when there cant possibly be any harm in not do so why call this object mine when just by stretch out my hand i could get another one that be like it and equally valuable in this state of affairs justice would be totally useless it would be an idle ceremonial have no place in the list of virtues even in the present needy condition of mankind we see that wherever any benefit be bestow by nature in an unlimited abundance we leave it in common among the whole human race not divide it up in term of right and property water and air though more need than anything else be not claim as the property of individuals and noone can commit an injustice by the most lavish use and enjoyment of these bless in large fertile countries with few inhabitants land be see in the same way and those who defend the liberty of the seas have as their principal theme the unexhausted use of them in navigationie the fact that however many ship there be the worlds oceans dont get use up if the benefit of navigation such as trade and treasurefinding be equally inexhaustible those defenders of the liberty of the seas would never have any opponents and no nation would ever have claim a separate exclusive dominion over some part of the ocean it can happen in some countries at some time that there be ownership of water but not of land see genesis and that happen if there be more land than the inhabitants can use and water be scarce and hard to find justice and benevolence here be a second supposition let us suppose that the human race while have the same need and shortages that it actually have have a mind that be so enlarge so full of friendship and generosity that each man have the utmost concern for every man feel no more concern for his own interest than for the interest of his fellows it seem obvious that this extensive benevolence would cancel the use of justice and the divisions and barriers of property and obligation would never be think of why should i want a contract or a promise to bind someone else to do me some good when i know that he already have the strongest inclination to seek my happiness and would unprompted perform the desire service what if his perform it would cause a greater loss to him than the benefit he would be bring to you in that case he know that my innate humanity and friendship will cause me to be the first to oppose this imprudent generosity why place boundarymarkers between my neighbour field and mine when my heart have make no division between my interest and his and share all his joy and sorrow with the same force and vivacity as if they be originally my own that be if they have begin as my own rather than become mine because my neighbour have them and i have a tender heart in this suppose state of affairs every man be a second self to another hume presumably mean to every other and would trust all his interest to the discretion of every man without jealousy without partition and without distinguish one person from another the whole human race would constitute a single family in which everything would be hold in common and be use freely without regard to property but cautiously too with as much concern for the need of each individual as if our own interest be intimately concern give what the human heart be actually like it might be hard to find complete examples of such enlarge affections but we may see approximations to it in families and in any group the stronger the mutual benevolence be among the individuals the nearer the group come to the noneedforjustice condition until all distinctions of property be in a great measure lose and mix up among them the laws presume that the cement of friendship between a marry couple be so strong as to abolish all division of possessions and in many case it actually be as strong as that and its a matter of empirical fact that during the ardour of new enthusiasms when every principle see note on title page be heat up into its most extreme form reformers have frequently try to abolish property ie have community of goods and what have lead the imprudent fanatics to change course and restore the ideas of justice and of separate propertythe only thing that could get them to do thisis their experience of the drawbacks that the noproperty system have because of the selfishness of men who hide their selfishness during the revolution or return to be selfish after the revolutionary fuss have die down thats a measure of how true it be that the virtue of justice derive its existence entirely from the need things that it do for human interactions and the social state of mankind justice and scarcity to make this truth more obvious let us reverse the suppositions we have be make take everything to the opposite extreme and see what effect that would have in each case suppose a society suffer such a lack of all common necessities that even with the utmost frugality and industry most of them will die prematurely and everyone live in extreme misery i think you will readily agree that in such a press emergency the strict laws of justice will be suspend be dislodge by the stronger motives of necessity and selfpreservation when a sailor whose ship be go down be in the water be it a crime for him to seize whatever he can to keep him afloat without regard to whose property it isor be if a besiege city be starve to death can we imagine that any citizen will see a mean of preservation within his reach and not take it lose his life because of his scrupulous regard for what in other situations would be the rule of property and justice what that virtue be for and what it tend to produce be happiness and security through the preservation of order in society but when a society be on the brink of perish from extreme necessity there be no greater evil to be fear from violence and injustice and every man may now provide for himself by any mean that prudence dictate and humanity permit even in case of need that be less drastic than the one we have be suppose the government open granaries without the consent of their owners on the correct assumption that the authority of the law can stretch that far as long as it do so in a fair way well if any number of men come together without the tie of laws or civil jurisdiction and suffer a famine would it be regard as criminal or injurious to divide up the available food equally if this be do through power and even violence justice and malevolence a few line down hume be probably use contempt in a less active sense than we give the word today in this milder sense to have contempt for something be to regard it as negligible to treat as of no accountthus many people contempt for order a soldier contempt for pain most occurrences of contempt in this work do use it in our stronger or more active sense now suppose that a virtuous man have the bad luck to fall into the society of ruffians far remove from the protection of laws and government how be he to behave in that miserable situation he see such ruthless and violent greed prevail such a disregard for fairness such contempt for social order such stupid blindness to future consequences that it be bind to have the most tragic conclusiondeath for the majority and total dissolution of this society for the rest the question be what should he do all he can do be to arm himself no matter whose sword or shield it be that he snatch up so as to provide himself with all possible mean of selfdefence and security his personal concern for justice be no longer any use for his own safety or anyone elses so he must consult the dictate of selfpreservation alone without concern for those who no longer deserve his care and attention the rule of justice can also be rightly suspend in a politically organize society when any man commit crimes that make him obnoxious to the public he be punish by the laws in his goods fin and in his person imprisonment or physical punishment this mean that the ordinary rule of justice be briefly suspend with regard to him and it become fair to inflict on him for the benefit of society things it would be wrong or injurious to inflict on him otherwise if it werent for this suspension punishment would always be wrong think about the rage and violence of a public wareg a war between two countries what be it but a suspension of justice among the war party who see that this virtue be now no longer of any use or advantage to them the laws of war which then take over from the laws of equity and justice be rule calculate to do good and be useful for men who be in that particular state they be now place in namely the state of war if a civilize nation be at war with barbarians who dont even respect any rule of war the former must also suspend their observance of any such rule because they no longer serve any purpose and they must make every battle or skirmish as bloody and destructive as possible to the barbarians whom we may suppose to have be the first aggressors thus the rule of equity or justice depend entirely on the particular state and condition in which men be place what start them and keep them in existence be their usefulness the utility that come to the public from their strict and regular observance if you reverse in any significant way the condition of menproduce extreme abundance or extreme need endow humans with perfect moderation and humanity or perfect rapacity and maliceyou make justice entirely useless totally destroy its essence and suspend its obligation on mankind the usual state of human affairs be a medium amidst all these extremes we be naturally partial to ourselves and our friends but be capable of learn the advantage result from a more equitable conduct few enjoyments be give us directly from the open and liberal hand of nature but by skill and hard work we can extract them in great abundance that be why the ideas of property become necessary in all civil society it be why justice be useful to the public and that be the sole source of its merit and moral obligation the golden age these conclusions be so natural and obvious that even the poets have notice them in their descriptions of the happiness of the golden age celebrate by ancient greek poets accord to those pleasant fictions the season in that first period of nature be so temperate that men didnt need clothe or house to guard against the violence of heat and cold the rivers flow with wine and milk the oaks yield honey nature spontaneously produce her greatest delicacies and that wasnt the best of it in that happy age not only be tempests remove from nature but the more violent inner tempests that now cause such uproar and create such confusion be unknown to human breast avarice ambition cruelty selfishness be never hear of the only state of mind that anyone have be cordial affection compassion and sympathy even the carefully correct distinction of mine and thine be banish from the human scene and take with it the very notions of property and obligation justice and injustice the state of nature this poetic fiction of the golden age be in some ways comparable with the philosophical fiction of the state of nature except that the former be represent as the most charm and peaceable condition that can possibly be imagine whereas the latter be depict as a state of mutual war and violence accompany by extreme need at the outset we be tell mankinds ignorance and savage nature be so prevalent that they couldnt trust one another each have to depend on himself and his own force or cunning for protection and security no law be hear of no rule of justice know no right of ownership respect the only measure of right be power and a perpetual war of all against all be the result of mens untamed selfishness and barbarity whether such a condition of human nature could exist and whether if it do it could for long deserve to be call a state be doubtful men be necessarily bear into a familysociety at least and be bring up by their parent to observe some rule of conduct and behaviour but it cant be deny that if such a state of mutual war and violence be ever real it would inevitably involve the suspension of all laws of justice because they couldnt do any possible good the more we look into human life from different angle and the newer and more unusual the light be in which we survey it the more well be convince that this account of the virtue of justice be realistic and satisfactory justice and the lesser breed here be a supposition of a quite different kind from the earlier ones suppose this to be the case mix in among mankind be creatures of a different species which though rational be so much weaker in body and mind than human be be that they cant stand up to us and can never however greatly provoke make us feel the effect of their resentment if this come true i think that we would be bind by the laws of humanity to treat these creatures gently but we wouldnt strictly speak lie under any restraint of justice with regard to them and they couldnt have any property or other right in relation to us though they might have them in relation to one another our relationships with them couldnt be call society a label that imply some degree of equality what there would be instead be absolute command on one side and servile obedience on the other if we want something they must immediately hand it over the only basis there be for them to own anything be our permit them to the this fiction of a state of nature as a state of war wasnt first invent by hobbes as be commonly imagine plato try to refute an hypothesis very like it in republic book whereas cicero treat it as common knowledge and certainly correct you cant not know that in the natural course of events before there be any natural or civil law fully lay down men wander in disorderly rabbles over the countryside and own only what they could seize and keep through wound and bloodshed by their own personal strength this lead the best and wisest men have consider what men be naturally like and how far they can be teach anything to bring together in one place those who have previously be scatter abroad and to lead them out of their savage way of life into one in which there be justice and gentleness the next step be to form the constitutions devise for human use that we call commonwealths then there be larger collections of men that come to be call state and then men build wall around set of house that we now call cities and divine and human laws begin to be recognise the biggest single difference between this manner of life polish by civilization and the savage one that come first be the fact that law be the rule principle of the one whereas violence dominate the other if we dont want to be guide by law we must settle for violence and if we want to put an end to violence well have to allow law to prevailie to allow court of justice to prevail because they contain within themselves all law and justice if we turn against court of justice or they be destroy or suspend violence will take over everyone see this cicero pro sestio this be a small episode in a very long defence speech to the roman senate which be sit as a court of law ciceros client be acquit only barrier they have to our lawless willlawless that be in relation to themis our compassion and kindness well never suffer any inconvenience from the exercise of our power over them a power that be so firmly establish in nature so the restraints of justice and property would be totally useless for us and would therefore never have a place in this unequal relationship this be clearly how men be situate in relation to animals be they rational ill leave that for others to determine the great superiority of civilize europeans over barbarous indians tempt us to think we relate to them as we do to the animals and lead us to throw off all restraints of justice and even of humanity in our treatment of them in many nations females be reduce to a similar slavery and be deny any right of property in relation to their lordly master but although the males when they combine force have in all countries enough bodily force to maintain this severe tyranny their fair companion have so much subtlety skill and charm that they be commonly able to break up the confederacy among the males and then share with them all the right and privilege of society now look at another sequence of suppositions suppose the human species be so build by nature that each individual have within himself everything need for his own preservation and for the propagation of his kind and that all society and all interactions between man and man be cut off by the primary intention of the supreme creator it seem obvious that such a solitary be would be no more capable of justice or injustice than he would be of social discourse and conversation if mutual respect and forbearance didnt achieve anything they would never guide the behaviour of any reasonable man the headlong rush of the emotions wouldnt be check by any reflection on future consequences and as each man would love himself alone and depend only on himself and his own activity for safety and happiness he would always do his very best to claim preference over every other be because he wouldnt be link to any of them by any tie of nature or of selfinterest now vary this last supposition of the solitariness of every human be by suppose that the conjunction of the sex be establish in nature that immediately give rise to families particular rule will be find to be necessary if it be to survive so these will be immediately accept as apply within each family though not as between any family and people outside it now suppose that a number of families unite to form a single society that have no link with any others in that case the rule preserve peace and order will extend themselves right out to the boundaries of society at any distance beyond those boundaries they will have no force because they wont do any good but then finally suppose that many distinct societies interact with one another for mutual convenience and advantage then the boundaries of justice still extend still wider in proportion to the breadth of mens view and the strength of their interconnections history experience and reason sufficiently instruct us in this natural development of human sentiments and in the gradual broaden of our view about the scope of justice in proportion as we come to know more about the utility of that virtue if we examine the particular laws by which justice be direct and property determine well still reach the same conclusion the only object of all these laws and regulations be the good of mankind its not just that the peace and interest of society require that there be an institution of individual ownership the actual rule by which we sort out the detail of what be mine and what be yours be themselves devise to serve as well as possible the further interest of society let us suppose that a creature who have reason but no experience of human nature be mull over the question of what rule of justice or property would best promote public interest and establish peace and security among mankind his most obvious think would be this give the largest possessions to those with the most virtue and give everyone a power of do good that be proportional to his want to do good this rule might be appropriatemight lead to the best resultsin a perfect theocracy in which everything happen through the particular volitions of an infinitely intelligent be but if mere mankind adopt such a law it couldnt be cleanly apply because merit be so uncertain the immediate result would be the total dissolution of society why be merit uncertain because it be naturally obscure and also because each individual overrate his own merit fanatics may think they be entitle to help themselves to others property because dominion be base on grace and saint alone inherit the earth but the law of the land rightly treat these highflying theorists as be on a par with common robbers and teach them by the severest discipline that a rule that seem in theory to be advantageous to society may be find in practice to be totally harmful and destructive history tell us that there be religious fanatics of this kind in england during the civil war though the obvious tendency towards chaos of these principles probably create so much horror in people that these dangerous wouldbe reformers felt compel to renounce or at least conceal their view perhaps the levellers who want all property to be distribute equally be a kind of political fanatics an offshoot of the religious ones they be more open about their view than the saintsaloneinherittheearth people because their view seem more capable of be put into practice as well as be more useful to human society there be indeed several sound things to be say in defence of the levellers nature be so generous towards mankind that if all her gift be evenly divide among our species and improve by skill and work every individual would enjoy all the necessities and most of the comfort of life and wouldnt be liable to any misfortunes except ones derive from physical illness whenever we depart from this equality we rob the poor of more satisfaction than we add to the rich the slight gratification of a frivolous vanity in one individual often cost more than bread to many families and even provinces the rule of equality as well as be potentially very useful isnt altogether impracticable it have actually be follow at least partially in some republics especially that of sparta where it be say to have be accompany by the most beneficial consequences and then there be the agrarian laws so often push for in rome and actually carry out in many greek cities those laws all come from a general idea of the good consequences the utility of the level principle but historians tell usand common sense agreesthat however attractive these ideas of perfect equality may be they be basically not practicable and if they could be and be put into practice their consequences would be extremely harmful to human society however equally possessions be divide up mens different degrees of skill care and industry will immediately break the equality and if you try to avoid this by put constraints on skill care and industry youll reduce society to extreme poverty instead of prevent want and beggary in a few people youll be make it unavoidable for the whole community also to spot any inequality the moment it show up there would have to be a rigorous monitor system and to punish and correct it there would have to be a very severe penal system that much authority would be sure to degenerate into tyranny and to be exercise in unfair ways butmore to the pointnobody could possibly have such authority in a society such as the levellers want perfect equality of possessions would destroy all subordination thereby greatly weaken the authority of officer of the law as well as level out property it would pretty well level out power what we can conclude from all this be that in order to establish laws for the regulation of property we must be acquaint with the nature and situation of man not be take in by mislead facts about what seem to be the case and search for the rule that be overall the most useful and beneficial to get this right one doesnt need to look very deeply into the human condition or to have a very broad experience of it but one do need to avoid be too selfish on the one hand or too uncritically egalitarian on the other as an example of how basically easy it be to get the right answer anyone can see that something produce or improve by a man skill or labour ought to be permanently his social benefit encourage such useful habit and accomplishments that his property ought to be inherit by his children and relations social purpose the same that he can consent to make it the property of someone else social purpose create the commerce and other interactions that be so beneficial to human society and that all contract and promise ought to be carefully fulfil social purpose to secure the mutual trust and confidence that do so much to promote the general interest of mankind in each case i be talk about the social purpose of have that rule about property not of act in that way in an individual case study the writers on the laws of nature and youll find that whatever principles they set out with they be sure to end up with the one i have be defend they all give as the ultimate reason for every rule that they lay down the convenience and necessities of mankind that be the most convince kind of support to havethe support of someone who be try to oppose ones view indeed what other reason could writers ever give for hold that this be mine and that be yours since nature leave to itself surely never make any such distinction the things label mine and yours be in themselves quite other than us they be totally separate from us and nothing but the general interest of society can form the connection it can happen that the interest of society require that there be some rule of justice in a particular kind of case but dont pick any particular rule out of several that be all equally beneficial when that happen the slightest analogies be lay hold of as a basis for select one rule over the others because there would be perpetual conflict if no selection be make and several rule be regard as be in force thats why your sheerly possessingbeing the first to possesssomething be suppose to make it yours if noone else have any prior claim to it many of the reason of lawyers be of this analogical nature and depend on very slight connections of the imagination what analogy be at work in the firstpossession rule in hum time analogy often mean merely similarity and his think here seem to be that have x physically under your control be superficially like legitimately own x do anyone hesitate in extraordinary case to violate all respect for the private property of individuals and sacrifice to public interest a distinction that be establish in the first place for the sake of that interest the safety of the people be the supreme law all other more special laws be subordinate to it and dependent on it and if in the common course of things those laws be follow and respect that be only because the public safety and interest commonly demand that society be govern in a way that be evenhanded and fair sometimes both utility and analogy fail and leave the laws of justice in total uncertainty we need to have a rule accord to which your have be in possession of something for a long time make you the rightful owner of it and we get that far through reason about utility and analogy but sheer reason wont take us any further ie it wont determine how many days months or years constitute a long time be for purpose of this rule in this case civil laws have to do what be not do by the natural code they assign different value of long time for different kinds of things that can be own depend on the different utilities that the legislator be concern about hum actual word here be accord to the different utilities propose by the legislator this have be announce as a case where utility and analogy fail perhaps he mean that here the rule be settle on the basis not of facts about utility but rather of what a legislator think about utility all question of property fall under the authority of civil laws which extend restrain modify and alter the rule of natural justice accord to the convenience of each community in particular the laws do or should constantly reflect the constitution of government the manners the climate the religion the commerce and the situation of each society a recent learn and able author have pursue this subject at great length and have grow from these seed a complete philosophy of politics with many ingenious and brilliant thoughts and some substance i be refer to montesquieu the author of lesprit des loix which appear in three years before the present work this illustrious writer start off from a different theory from mine take all right to be base on certain relations rapports he mean that accord to montesquieu all moral truths can be deduce from objective facts about how things relate to one another in my opinion this be a system that will never be reconcile with true philosophy malebranche seem to have be the first proponent of this abstract theory of morals which be afterwards adopt by cudworth clarke and others because it leave out all sentiment or feel and claim to base everything on reason it have have plenty of followers in this philosophic age see my and appendix with regard to justiceour present topicthe case against this theory seem short and conclusive property depend on civil laws the sole purpose of civil laws be to secure the interest of society therefore the interest of society be the sole foundation of property and justice hume say that each premise be allow and that the conclusion must be allow presumably he mean in each case allow by montesquieu not to mention the fact that the interest of society provide the whole basis for our be oblige to obey the civil law two further considerations it sometimes happen that the way the civil law handle something clash with our ideas of justice case where this happen be not objections to my theory they be confirmations of it when a civil law be so perverse that it go against all the interest of society it lose all its authority and then men judge by the ideas of natural justice which be in line with those interest sometimes the civil laws for good reason require that a certain kind of performance involve a ceremony or a special form when that be lack the civil law say that from a legal point of view the performance hasnt happen this decree of the law run contrary to our usual ideas of justice and those ideas remain at work in a case like this someone who take advantage of such legal technicalities be usually regard as dishonest thus the interest of society require that contract be fulfil and this be as basic as you can get in both natural and civil justice but the omission of a trivial detaileg the contract be date as well as signedwill often invalidate a contract as a matter of public law but it wont invalidate it in the court of conscience in a case of this sort we take it that the judge be withdraw his power of enforce the right that be mean to arise from the contract not declare that there isnt such a right what be a man property anything that it be lawful for him and only him to use what rule do we have for pick out these object here we must have resort to statutes customs precedents analogies and a hundred other thingssome of them constant and inflexible others variable and arbitrary matter of choice but what they be all root in be the interest and happiness of human society if we leave that out of account nothing could appear more whimsical unnatural and even superstitious than most of the laws of justice and of property justice and superstition it be a very easy task to ridicule simpleminded superstitions and expose the folly of special attitudes to foods days place posture clothe all you need do be to consider all the qualities and relations of the object in question and discover no adequate cause for the affection or antipathy veneration or horror that have such a great influence over a large part of mankind a syrian would starve rather than taste pigeon an egyptian wont come near bacon but when these foods be examine by the sense of sight smell or taste or study through the sciences of chemistry medicine or physics no difference be ever find between them and any other kind of meat no factual basis be ever find for the religious passion a fowl on thursday be lawful food on friday its abominable egg in this house and in this diocese be permit during lend just down the road eat them be a damnable sin yesterday there be nothing religious about this plot of land or this build today the mumble of certain word have make it holy and sacred when a philosopher point these things out its safe to say that he wont make any difference to anyone the facts be so obvious that everyone must have notice them at first sight when they dont prevail that isnt because people dont know the facts or have misunderstand them somehow its because of people upbringing prejudice and passion someone who doesnt look carefully enough or who be think at too a high a level of generality might come to think that a similar superstition be involve in all the sentiments see note on page of justice and that if we take the focus of justicenamely what we call propertyand subject it to the same scrutiny of sense and science we wont find however hard we look any foundation for the distinctions draw by moral sentiment it be lawful for me to eat fruit from this tree but it would be a crime for me to take fruit of the same kind from a tree a few yards away if i have be dress like this an hour ago i would have deserve the severest punishment but a man have pronounce a few magical syllables and thereby make it proper for me to be clothe in this way if this house be in the neighbour territory it would have be immoral for me to live in it but because it be build on this side of the river it be subject to a different municipal law and i incur no blame or censure by come to own it it may be think then that the kind of reason that so successfully expose superstition can also be apply to justice and that its no more possible with justice than with superstition to pick out the precise feature of the object that be the basis for the sentiment but theres this solid difference superstition be frivolous useless and burdensome whereas justice be absolutely necessary for the wellbeing of mankind and the existence of society when we set this fact aside we couldnt overlook itits too obvious for that it have to be agree that all respect for right and property seem to be entirely without foundation as much so as the grossest and most vulgar superstition why do that man make certain sound imply consent change the nature of my action with regard to this object why do the recite of a liturgy by a priest dress in a certain way and hold his body in a certain way make a heap of brick and timber forever sacred if the interest of society werent involve in any way the former question would be an unanswerable as the latter these reflections dont weaken the obligations of justice or take anything away from the most sacred attention to property on the contrary such sentiments get new force from my reason what stronger foundation can be desiredor even conceivedfor any duty than to observe that if it isnt establish human society or even human nature will collapse and that our nature and society will arrive at still greater degrees of happiness and perfection to the extent that the duty in question be regard as inviolable justice as an instinct the dilemma seem obvious justice obviously tend to promote public utility and to support civil society the obviously the will or consent alone never transfer property or create the obligation of a promise for the will to impose an obligation on any man it must be express by word or sign the word initially come in as subservient to the will but before long they become the principal part of the promise and a man who secretly intend not to keep his promise and withhold the assent of his mind isnt any less bind by the promise but though in most case the expression be the whole promise it isnt always so someone who utter the word without know their mean wouldnt have make a bind promise someone who know what the word mean and utter them only as a joke give clear sign that he have no serious intention of bind himself wouldnt be oblige to keep the promise but for this to hold good the clear sign mustnt be ones that we cleverly detect while the man be try to deceive us for him not to be bind by a verbal promise he must give sign different from sign of deceit that he doesnt intend to keep the promise all these contradictions be easily account for if justice arise entirely from its public utility its usefulness to society theyll never be explain on any other basis in the next sentence a casuist be someone who apply general moral and religious doctrines to particular case a relax casuist be one who cut corner and stretch point in do this it be remarkable that the moral decisions of the jesuits and other relax casuists be usually make in the course of deal with subtleties of reason such as i have be point out why have the indignation of mankind rise so high against these casuists it can only be because everyone see that if the practice the casuists be try to rule out be authorize human society couldnt survive and that morals should always be handle with a view to public interest rather than to the demand of highlevel finegrained philosophical theories of morals any sensible person can have the think if the secret direction of the intention can invalidate a contract where be our security but someone come at this from an abstract metaphysical point of view might think that where an intention be suppose to be requisite if it really wasnt there then no consequence ought to followno obligation would be impose the casuistical subtleties may not be greater than the subtleties of lawyers that i have hint at above but they meet with very different receptions from the world because the former be pernicious while the latter be innocent and even necessary the roman catholic church teach that any sacrament can be invalidate by the frame of mind of the officiate priest this position come from rigorously follow through the seem consequences of the obvious truth that empty word alone without any mean or intention in the speaker can never have any effect the analogous position in civil laws would be that any civil contract can be nullify by the frame of mind of one of the party to it what be at stake in be the eternal salvation of thousands of people whereas whats at stake in be merely the upset of civil society so why do we not follow the church lead in by accept regard civil contract our rejection of come entirely from our sense of the danger and inconvenience that would ensue from accept it this give us a clear example of the fact that however positive arrogant and dogmatic any superstition may appear to be it can never thoroughly convince anyone that its threats be real or get anyone to give them any weight at all when balance against the common incidents of life that we learn from daily observation and empirical think sentiment of justice could be derive from our reflect on that tendency the only alternative be that the sentiment of justicelike hunger thirst and other appetites and like resentment love of life attachment to offspring and other passions arise from a simple basic instinct in the human constitution implant there by nature for similar salutary purpose if be the case it follow that propertywhich be what justice be aboutis mark off by a simple basic instinct and be not ascertain by any argument or reflection but who ever hear of such an instinct perhaps we have it but it hasnt yet be discover that be obviously wrong this be not a subject in which new discoveries can be make we would have as much chance of discover in the human body a new sense that noone have notice before and theres another point it look like a very simple proposition to say that nature distinguish property through an instinctive sentiment but in reality well find that there would have to be ten thousand different instincts many of them concern with object have great finegrained intricacy for when a definition of property be require the ownership relation be find to break down into possession acquire by occupation by industry by prescription by inheritance by contract and so on be it believable that nature through a basic instinct instruct us in all these methods of acquisition also the word inheritance and contract stand for ideas that be infinitely complicate a hundred volumes of laws and a thousand volumes of commentators havent be find sufficient to define them exactly do nature whose instincts in men be all simple embrace such complicate and artificial object and this be a different point do nature create a rational creature without trust anything to the operation of his reason even if all those difficulties be overcome the basic instinct theory of justice still wouldnt be satisfactory manmade laws can certainly transfer property must we say that it be by another basic instinct that we acknowledge the authority of kings and senates and mark all the boundaries of their jurisdiction judge too even when their sentence be wrong and illegal must be allow for the sake of peace and order to have decisive authority and ultimately to determine who own what do we have basic innate ideas of magistrates and chancellors and juries isnt it obvious that all these institutions arise merely from the necessities of human society all bird of the same species build their nest alike at every time and in every country thats the force of instinct at work men build their house differently at different time and in different place that show the influence of reason and custom a similar inference can be draw from a comparison of the sexual instinct with the institution of property that be the contrast between the sameness of the nest of any one species of bird and the variety among human house be comparable with the contrast between the sameness of human sexual feel and conduct around the world and across the age and the variety among systems of civil laws now it have to be admit that systems of civil law despite their variety be pretty much the same in their general outlinesbecause what they be mean to achieve and mainly do achieve be pretty much the same similarly all house have a roof and wall windows and chimneys though they be vary in their shape layout and materials but the common feature of house clearly point to the conveniences of human life and equally clearly so do the common feature of systems of civil law its really clear with both that the source of all this be reason and reflection on human need rather than a basic instinct i neednt mention the variations that all the rule of property receive from the finer turn and connections of the imagination and from the subtleties and abstractions of lawtopics and reason this cant possibly be reconcile with the notion of basic instincts snap judgments about injustice here be something that will create a doubt about the theory of justice that i have be defend our upbringing and acquire habit have the effect that when we blame something as an injustice we arent always conscious of any immediate reflection on its bad consequences when something be very familiar to us its familiarity make us apt to overlook it and what we have very frequently do for certain reason we be apt to go on do mechanically without recall every time the thoughts that first lead us to this the considerations of human convenienceor rather necessitythat lead to our have the notion of justice be so universal and everywhere point so much to the same rule of justice that the habit of condemn unjust act and institutions take place in all societies and we have to think about it a little to ascertain its true origin not that the origin be notably obscure even in ordinary everyday life we often resort to the principle of public utility say to ourselves or otherswhat would become of the world if that kind of behaviour be rampant how could society survive under such disorder from all this we seem to have learn something about the force that i have be highlightingthe force of thoughts about public interest and utilitynamely how strongly it affect our level of admiration or moral approval the sole basis for the virtue of justice be that justice be necessary for the support of society and since no moral excellence be more highly esteem than justice be we can conclude that this matter of usefulness have generally the strongest energy and most complete command over our sentiments so it must be the source of a considerable part of the merit ascribe to humanity benevolence friendship public spirit and other social virtues of that sort just as it be the sole source of our moral approval of fidelity justice veracity integrity and those other estimable and useful qualities and force in say this i be rely on the principle when any force have be find to have a great strength and energy in one instance credit it with have a similar energy in all similar instance this be entirely agreeable to the rule of philosophy here empirical science and even of common sense and it be indeed newtons chief rule of scientific method source of morals david hume political society political society if everyone be intelligent and wise enough to perceive at all time how strongly his interest be serve by the observance mean his observance of justice and equity and be strongminded enough to keep steadily focus on his overall longterm interest rather than be divert by the enticements of present pleasure and advantage there would never have be any such thing as government or political society in the situation as i have describe it each man would have live in entire peace and harmony with everyone elsedoing this in the exercise of his natural liberty with no constraints from governmental laws what need be there for manmade laws when unaided natural justice be a sufficient restraint if nothing ever go wrong why have judge why curtail our natural freedom when all our use of it be find to be innocent and beneficial obviously if there no way for government to be in the least useful it wouldnt exist the whole basis for the duty of allegiance to the government of ones country be the good that government do for society by preserve peace and order among mankind laws of nations when a number of political societies be form and they maintain a thick web of interactions amongst themselves it be immediately find that a new set of rule would be useful in that situation so such rule come into existence under the title laws of nations examples include ambassadors be not to be harm in any way poison weapons be not to be use a soldier in battle be not to be immediately kill if he surrender these rule and others of that kind be plainly calculate for the advantage of state and kingdoms in their interrelations the rule of justice that apply among individuals be not entirely suspend among political societies all rulers claim to respect the right of other rulers and no doubt some of them can say this without hypocrisy alliances and treaties be constantly be make between independent state and this would be a mere waste of parchment if it hadnt be find that treaties etc have some influence and authority but here be the difference between kingdoms and individuals human nature cant possibly survive without the association of individuals and that association can exist only if some respect be pay to the laws of equity and justice disorder confusion the war of all against all be the inevitable upshot of such licentious conduct as would occur if equity and justice have no place nations on the other hand can survive without have relations with one another they can even survive to some extent under a general war though respect for justice be useful among state it isnt as necessary or useful there as it be among individuals and correspond to that lessen usefulness be a lessen degree of moral obligation all politicians and most philosophers will allow that in particular emergencies reason of state may justify dispense with the rule of justice unilaterally invalidate some treaty or alliance the strict observance of which would be very harmful to either of the contract party but it be generally agree that nothing less than the most extreme necessity can justify individuals in a breach of promise or an invasion of the properties of others in a confederate commonwealth such as the ancient achaean republic in greece or todays swiss canton and unite provinces the netherlands the league have a source of morals david hume political society special utility and so the condition of union have a special sacredness and authority and a violation of them would be regard as be at least as criminal as any private injury or injustice chastity the long and helpless infancy of a human be require that the parent work together for the care of their young and this collaboration require the virtue of chastity ie fidelity to the marriage bed youll agree that if chastity werent useful in that way it would never have be think of as a virtue sexual infidelity in marriage be much more harmful in women than in men thats why the laws of chastity be much stricter over the female sex than over the male these rule be all connect with procreation yet they be suppose to apply to women who be past childbearing as much as to those in the flower of their youth and beauty general rule be often extend beyond their original source and this be true in all matter of taste and sentiment the star passage expand what hume write in ways that the small dot convention cant easily indicate it be agree that our ideas about personal beauty arise very much from ideas of utility an example might be this we see a humpback as ugly basically because we think of such a hump as an obstacle to activity to do well in lifethe opposite of useful now consider this story that have come out of france during a stockmarket surge in paris a humpbacked fellow go every day to the street where the stockbrokers gather and be well pay for let them use his hump as a desk on which to sign their contract so his hump be thoroughly useful but would the money that he make in this way turn him into a handsome fellow no the imagination be influence by associations of ideas and even if a give association initially arise from the judgmentsuch as the association of humpbacked with ugly mediate by the judgment that hump back be not usefulit isnt easily alter by particular exceptions that we come across that could explain our hostility to sexual infidelity in women who be past childbearing age there be also something else we can add if older women be free to be unchaste their example would be harmful to the younger ones if women could always look forward to a time when they would be at liberty to indulge themselves in this way it would be natural for them to bring that time closer ie not to wait and to think more lightly of this whole duty that be in fact so much need by society incest members of a single family live together have such frequent opportunities for licence of this kind hum exact phrase that nothing could preserve purity of manners if marriage or any sexual relationship be allow between people who be closely relate to one another incest therefore be especially harmful in its effect be regard as especially wicked and morally ugly and some of the detail of the antiincest morality can also be explain in term of consequences as i shall now show why do the laws of athens allow a man to marry a halfsister who have the same father as he do but not platos only answer to objections raise against the community of women that be establish in his imaginary commonwealth be this it be a good say and still be that what be useful be fair what be useless be ugly republic there cant be any doubt about this where public usefulness be concernedand that be platos topic indeed what other point be there to all the ideas of chastity and modesty phaedrus write unless what we do be useful the glory of it be nil plutarch write nothing that be harmful be beautiful the stoics think the same hume quote sextus empiricus as report this about the stoics he quote phaedrus in latin sextus in greek and plato and plutarch in both source of morals david hume political society a halfsister who have the same mother plainly for this reason the manners of the athenians be so reserve that a man be never allow to approach the womens part of any house even the house of a close relative except when he be pay a visit to his own mother his stepmother and her childrenincluding the halfsister be as much shut up from him as the women of any other family so that there be as little danger of any unlawful sexual relations between him and them as between him and any other women whereas a halfsister with whom he share a mother would be someone he have grow up with and see countless time for a similar reason uncles and nieces be allow to marry at athens but the permittedinathens marriages that i have mention be not permit in rome where relations between the sex be more open public utility be the cause of all these variations other kinds of immoral conduct if something that doesnt do a man credit escape his lips in private conversation or if he say it in a private letter it be highly blameworthy to repeat it to anyone else the free and social interactions of mind would be seriously inhibit if such rule of trustworthiness be not establish even in pass on gossip from which we cant foresee any harm result it be regard as a piece of indiscretion if not of immorality to tell whom we get the story from as these stories be pass from hand to hand they be alter in various ways and they often reach the persons concernedthe persons they be aboutand produce animosities and quarrel among people whose intentions be entirely innocent and inoffensive to pry into secrets to open or even read the letter of others to spy on their word and look and actionswhat practice be more troublemaking in society what habit therefore be more blameable this principle see note on title page of the wellbeing of society be also the basis for most of the laws of good mannersa kind of lesser morality that aim at the ease of company and conversation too much ceremony be blame so be too little and anything that promote ease without an indecent familiarity be useful and praiseworthy it be commendable to be constant in ones friendships attachments and familiarities and this be need to support trust and good relations in society but in place where people come together casually in some pursuit of health and pleasure public convenience doesnt require such constancy it be customary to encourage unreserved conversation in such contexts by grant the privilege of then drop ones casual acquaintance without this be a breach of civility or good manners the morality of lesser societies even in societies with utterly immoral foundations ones that be the most destructive to the interest of the general society there have to be certain rule that the members be constrain to observe by a sort of false honour as well as by private selfinterest robbers and pirate it have often be remark couldnt maintain their harmful confederacy if they didnt establish a new distributive justice among themselves call into force among themselves the laws of equity they have violate with the rest of mankind i hate a drink companion say the greek proverb who never forget the follies of the last drink spree should be bury in eternal oblivion so as to give full scope to the follies of the next one in any society or club that exist for the purpose of play some game there have to be laws govern how the game be play and these laws be different for different game the basis for such societies be admittedly frivolous and the laws be to a great extent though not entirely source of morals david hume why utility please capricious and arbitrary that create an important difference between these laws and the rule of justice fidelity and loyalty because the latter be require for there to be general societies of men which be absolutely requisite for the survival of the species so there be only a very limit liken between the rule of game and the moral rule of society at large all we can learn from it probably be that rule be necessary whenever men have any kind of relations with each other they cant even pass each other on the road without rule waggoners coachmen and mount couriers have principles govern who give way to whom and these be mainly base on mutual ease and convenience but some of them be arbitrary or at least dependent on a kind of capricious analogy like many of the reason of lawyers and it go even further than that men cant even murder each other without rule and maxims and an idea of justice and honour war have its laws as well as peace and even the kind of warforamusement that be carry on among wrestlers boxers and gladiators be regulate by fix principles the people concern have some interest in common and thus a share notion of what be useful and from this there inevitably arise a standard of right and wrong among them why utility please we praise the social virtues because of their utilitythats such a natural think that one would expect to meet with it everywhere in moral writers as the main basis for their reason and enquiry in ordinary everyday life the utility of conduct be always appeal to and we cant think of any greater eulogy to give to any man than to display his usefulness to the public and list the service he have do for mankind and society even our praise for the regularity and elegance of an inanimate form be conditional on those feature not destroy the things fitness for any useful purpose and what a satisfactory apology we can make

its prow be wider one such rule be the lighter machine must yield to the heavier and in machine of the same kind the empty one must yield to the one that be load this rule be base on convenience then there be this rule those who be go to the capital city have precedence over those who be come from it this seem to be base on some idea of dignity of the great city and of the preference for the future over the past which if it be correct bring this rule under the head of arbitrary and capricious source of morals david hume why utility please than its stern than it would if it be build with precise geometrical regularity if a build doors and windows be exact square it would hurt the eye just because of that squareness which be illadapted to the shape of a human be for whose use the build be intend so its not surprise that a man whose habit and conduct be harmful to society and dangerous or harmful to everyone who have any connection with him should for that reason be an object of disapproval communicate to every spectator the strongest sentiment or feel of disgust and hatred and yet these effect of usefulness or its contrary have not loom large in philosophers systems of ethics and they have look elsewhere for explanations of the origin of moral good and evil why perhaps its because they find it hard to account for our attitude to usefulness but if we have have experience that confirm the existence of a principle see note on title page we shouldnt reject it just because we cant give a satisfactory account of its origin or show it to be a special case of some more general principle as for our present topic if we would just think about it for a little while we would find it easy enough to account for the influence that utility have on our feel and to deduce it from more general principles that be the best know the most thoroughly recognize in human nature moralitys basis be nature not indoctrination ancient and modern sceptics have infer from the apparent usefulness of the social virtues that all moral distinctions arise from cultural influence and that they be first invent and then encourage by the skill of politicians so as to make men manageable and to subdue the natural ferocity and selfishness which have make them unfit for society its true that this principle of instruction and upbringing have a powerful influence so that it can often make the sentiments of approval or dislike greater or smaller than they would have be if leave to nature and sometimes it can even create a new sentiment of approval or dislike one that owe nothing to any natural principlewhich be what happen in all superstitious practice and observances but surely no thoughtful enquirer would think that all moral affection or dislike arise from this origin if nature hadnt make any such distinction base on the original constitution of the mind language would not have contain the word honourable and shameful lovely and odious noble and despicable and if politicians have invent these term they could never have make them intelligible to anyone so this paradox of the sceptics be just very superficial it isnt hard to fend off the nitpick of that sect in the context of politics and morals it would be good if we deal with them as well in the context of the theoretical and less intelligible sciences of logic and metaphysics so we have to acknowledge that the social virtues have a natural beauty and amiableness which right from the outsetbefore any instruction or cultural inputattracts the respect and we oughtnt to think that because an inanimate object a chair say can be useful as well as a man it ought to qualify for the label virtuous as a man can the sentiments arouse by utility be very different in the two case in the case of the man the feel be mix with affection respect approval and so on but not in the case of the chair similarly the chair may have good colour and proportion just as a human figure can but can we ever be in love with the chair there be many passions and sentiments of which think rational be be the only proper object this be settle by the basic constitution of human nature and if qualities that would arouse love and affection in a human be be transfer to an inanimate object they wouldnt arouse the same sentiments a very small variation in the object even when the same qualities be preserve will destroy a sentiment thus the beauty for which a man love a woman if transfer to a man would not arouse an amorous passion except in case where nature be extremely pervert source of morals david hume why utility please affection of mankind and because the chief source of the merit of these virtues be their public utility it follow that the end that they tend to promote must be in some way agreeable to us take hold of some natural affection public utility must pleaseeither for selfinterested reason or from more generous motives the selfinterest theory of morality it have often be maintain that because every man have a strong connection with society and see that he cant possibly survive in isolation he favour all the habit or principles that promote order in society and give him the quiet possession of this priceless bless however much we value our own happiness and welfare we must to that extent applaud the practice of justice and humanity which be our only way of maintain the social confederacy and get for every man the advantage of mutual protection and assistance this derivation of morals from a concern for ones own interest be an obvious think and it hasnt arise wholly from the irresponsible tease attack of the sceptics to mention no others polybiusone of the gravest and most judicious writers of antiquity as well as one of the most moralhas trace all our sentiments of virtue to this selfish origin this be in book chapter of his histories but though the solid practical sense of that author and his dislike of vain subtleties give him considerable authority on the present subject this isnt something to be settle by authority and the voice of nature and experience seem plainly to oppose the selfish theory we often praise virtuous action that be perform long ago and far away where the utmost subtlety of imagination couldnt discover any appearance of selfinterest or find any way of connect our present happiness and security with events so widely separate from us when an adversary do something generous brave noble we approve his action even if we know that its consequences will go against our particular interest in any case where private advantage go along with our general affection for virtue we easily see and acknowledge the mixture of these distinct sentiments which feel different and have different influence on the mind we be perhaps quicker to praise generous humane action that further our own interest but those interest come nowhere near to explain the topics of praise that we insist on probably mean the general principles that govern our most intensely felt praise and we can try to bring other people over to our sentiments without try to convince them that they get any advantage from the action that we be present for their approval and applause if you describe the model of a praiseworthy character consist of all the most lovable moral virtues and give examples in which these virtues display themselves in an extraordinary manner you will easily elicit esteem and approval from all your audience without their even ask when and where this noble person live yet when and where be absolutely crucial to selflove ie the concern for ones own individual happiness heres an example of what undutifulness to parent be disapprove of by every person who reflect on what he see and compare the future with the past express his indignation at this illtreatment to which he foresee that he also may some day be expose ingratitude be disapprove of for a similar reason though polybius seem here to mix in something more generous each person be bind to be shock by ingratitude through sympathy with the resentment of his neighbour and from the think that he may at some time suffer in the same way and from that arise in the mind of every man a certain sense of the nature and force of duty perhaps he mean only that our sympathy or humanity be more enliven by our consider the similarity of our case with that of the person suffer which be a good point source of morals david hume why utility please i mean there be a statesman who in the shock and contest of partypolitical conflict manage through his eloquence to get an able adversary banish he secretly follow the adversary offer him money for his support during his exile and consolation in his misfortunes alas cry the banish statesman how i regret leave my friends in this city where even enemies be so generous we give this conduct the praise and approval that it deserve and we dont retract these sentiments when we learn that all this happen in athens about two thousand years ago and that the men involve be eschines and demosthenes when press by these facts and arguments a defender of the selfinterest theory of morality might say we transport ourselves by the force of imagination into distant time and place and think about the advantage that we would have reap from these character if we have be contemporaries and have be involve in the situation this be a dodge and a weak one at that it be not conceivable how a real sentiment or passion could arise in us from what we know to be an imaginary interest especially when our real interest be still keep in view and be often acknowledge to be entirely distinct from the imaginary one and sometimes even opposite to it a man who be bring to the brink of a precipice cant look down without tremble and the sentiment of imaginary danger drive him in opposition to his belief that he be really safe this may look like a real example of something i have say to be inconceivable but it isnt really because it have a special feature in this case the imagination be help by the presence of a strike objectthe cliffface and the sheer drop and also because it be really a different phenomenon even the strike object wont have this effect unless it be for this man somewhat unusual and unfamiliar custom soon reconcile us to heights and precipices and wear off these false and delusive terrors in our estimate of character and conduct the reverse be the case the oftener we engage in careful scrutiny of morals the more delicate be the feel we acquire of the most minute differences between vice and virtue indeed in everyday life we so often express all kinds of moral determinations that nothing of this kind could be new or unusual to us and no false view or prejudice could hold their grind against experience that be so common and familiar what mainly form associations of ideas be experience so that no association could possibly be establish and survive in direct opposition to experience usefulness be agreeable and elicit our approval this be a matter of fact confirm by daily observation but useful for what for somebodys interest surely whose interest then not only our own for our approval frequently extend beyond our own interest so it must be the interest of those who benefit from the character or action we approve of from which we can conclude that the welfare of those people however far away they be in time or space be not a matter of total indifference to us by open up this principle see note on title page we shall discover one great source of moral distinctions selflove be such a busily energetic drive in human nature and the interest of each individual be usually so closely connect with that of the community that there be an excuse for the philosophers who think that all our concern source of morals david hume why utility please for the public might ultimately come down to a concern for our own happiness and preservation heres how they arrive at that think they saw every moment instance of approval or blame satisfaction or displeasure towards character and action they call the object of these sentiments virtues or vices they saw that virtues tend to increase the happiness of mankind and that vices tend to increase mankinds misery they ask themselves could it be that we have any general concern for society or any disinterested not self interest resentment of the harm that come to others and they find it simpler to regard all these sentiments as special case of selflove and discover an excuse at least for this unify move in the fact that the interest of any individual be so often closely link to the interest of the public despite this frequent mix of interest however it be easy to perform what natural scientistsfollowing bacon call a crucial experiment one that point out the right way in any doubt or ambiguity we have find case where someones private interest be different fromeven contrary tothe public interest and where nevertheless the moral sentiment stay steady despite this divergence of interest and whenever these distinct interest be see to coincide we always find a noticeable increase in the sentiment a warmer affection for virtue a more intense detestation of vice feel that be properly call gratitude and revenge under pressure from these examples we have to reject the theory that account for every moral sentiment in term of selflove we must make room for a more publicaffection and allow that we have some concern for the interest of society consider just in itself usefulness be only a tendency to lead to a certain result and it be a contradiction in term to say i be please with x as a mean to y though y itself be something i be not concern with thus if usefulness be a source of moral sentiment and if this usefulness be not always think of in term of useful to me it follow that anything that contribute to the happiness of society recommend itself directly to our approval and goodwill here be a drive within us that account in great part for the origin of morality why should we look for abstruse and remote systems when such an obvious and natural one lie ready to hand sympathy see note on page be it hard for us to understand the force of humanity and benevolence or to take in that the very look of happiness joy and prosperity give pleasure the very look of pain suffer and sorrow communicate uneasiness the latin poet horace say that the human countenance borrow smile or tear from the human countenancehuman face laugh with those who laugh and weep with those who weep if you reduce a person to solitude he will lose almost all enjoyment because his emotions arent help along by correspond emotions in his fellowcreatures i say almost all because he might still have intellectual pleasures eg from solve a mathematical problem and sensual we neednt push our research so far as to ask why do we have humanity ie a fellowfeeling with others its enough that we experience this as a force in human nature our examination of cause must stop somewhere and in every science there be some general principles drive that we cant hope to show to be special case of something even more general no man be absolutely indifferent to the happiness and misery of others the first have a natural tendency to give pleasure the second pain you can find this in yourselfso can anyone its not likely that these principles can be resolve into simpler and more universal ones whatever attempt may have be make to do that and even if it be possible that wouldnt be part of my present topic for present purpose we can safely treat these principles as basic and be well satisfy if we can make all their consequences sufficiently plain and clear that be we can ignore any question about what lead to them and focus on what come from them source of morals david hume why utility please pleasures eg feel warm and well feed even when the sign of sorrow and mourn be arbitrary conventional or at any rate not natural they still make us sad and the natural symptoms tear and cry and groan never fail to create compassion and uneasiness in other people mind and if the effect of misery affect us in such a lively manner can we be suppose to be entirely unfeeling or indifferent towards its cause when a malicious or treacherous character and conduct be present to us suppose we enter a convenient warm welldesigned apartment we have to get pleasure just from see it because it present us with the please ideas of ease satisfaction and enjoyment the hospitable goodhumoured humane landlord appear and this event must surely make the whole even more attractive and we cant easily forbear reflect with pleasure on the satisfaction that everyone get from their deal with him his whole family show their happiness by the freedom ease confidence and calm enjoyment express in their face i have a please sympathy in the prospect of so much joy and cant think of the source of it without have the most agreeable emotions he tell me that an oppressive and powerful neighbour try to dispossess him of his inheritance and for years disturb all his innocent and social pleasures i feel an immediate indignation arise in me against such violence and injury he add that it isnt surprise that a private wrong should come from a man who have enslave provinces depopulate cities and make the battlefield and the scaffold stream with human blood i be strike with horror at the prospect of so much misery and be drive by the strongest hostility towards its author wherever we go whatever we think or talk about just about everything present us with a view of human happiness or misery and arouse in us a sympathetic surge of pleasure or uneasiness in our serious occupations and in our careless amusements this principle still exert its active energy sympathy and the ar ts a man who enter a theatre be immediately impress by the view of so many people share in one common pastime and he experience just from the look of them a heighten of his disposition to have every sentiment or feel that his fellowcreatures have he notice that the actors be energise by the appearance of a full house and raise to a level of enthusiasm that they cant command when they be calm and alone if the play be skillfully write every emotion represent on the stage be communicate to the spectators as though by magic the spectators weep tremble resent rejoice and be inflame with all the variety of passions that drive the character in the drama when an event in the play go against our wish and interrupt the happiness of our favourite character we be conscious of feel anxiety and concern if their suffer come from the treachery cruelty or tyranny of an enemy we experience intense resentment against the enemy it be regard as contrary to the rule of art to represent a calamity in a cool and indifferent manner a distant friend or a confidant who have nothing immediately at stake in the catastrophe ought if possible to be avoid by the playwright because such a character might communicate a similar indifference to the audience few species of poetry be more entertain than the pastoral and we be all aware that the chief source of its source of morals david hume why utility please pleasure arise from the image of a gentle and tender tranquillity that it represent in its character communicate a similar sentiment to the reader the italian poet sannazaro in his piscatory eclogues shift the scene from gentle pleasant meadows to the seashore this let him present the ocean the most magnificent object in nature but it be agree that it be a wrong choice the idea of the toil labour and danger suffer by the fishermen be painful to the reader because of the unavoidable sympathy that accompany every conception of human happiness or misery no passion when well represent can be entirely indifferent to us because every man have within him at least the seed and first principles see note on title page of every passion its poetrys business to bring every affection near to us by lively imagery and representation make it look like truth and reality which be a certain proof that wherever reality itself be find our mind be dispose to be strongly affect by it any recent event that affect the fate of state provinces or many individuals be extremely interest even to those whose welfare be not directly involve news of such an event be quickly spread eagerly hear and enquire into with attention and concern on such an occasion the interest of society appear to be to some extent the interest of each individual the imagination be sure to be affect though the passions that be arouse may not always be strong and steady enough to have much influence on behaviour read a history book seem like a calm entertainment but it wouldnt entertain at all if the reader didnt have feel correspond to those that the historian describe its hard to read thucydides or guicciardin attentively while one describe trivial clash between small cities of greece and the other describe the harmless war between pisa and florence not many people be involve and the interest be small so these passages dont fill our imagination or bring our feel into play but the deep distress of the large athenian army that attack syracuse and the danger that constitute such a strong threat to venicethese arouse compassion these move terror and anxiety we can become convince of the cruel depravity of the roman emperors nero and tiberius by the cool uninvolving style of suetonius as well as by the masterly write of tacitus but what a difference in our feel suetonius coldly relate the facts whereas tacitus set before our eye the venerable figure of soranus and thraseatwo of neros innocent victimswho face their fate bravely and be move only by the melt sorrow of their friends and families what sympathy then touch every human heart what indignation against the tyrant whose ungrounded fear or unprovoked malice give rise to such detestable barbarity if we shift from play and historybooks and look at reallife events that we observe for ourselves powerful concern be arouse and how much stronger it often be than the narrow attachments of selflove and selfinterest popular uprise party zeal devote obedience to leaders of groupsthese be some of the most visible effect though not the most commendable of this social sympathy in human nature our feel be somewhat engage by anything that carry an image of human sentiment and affection even when the subject be fairly trivial when a person stutter we sympathize with this trivial uneasiness and suffer for him and it be a rule in criticism that every combination of syllables or letter that be hard to pronounce sound harsh and disagreeable to the ear apparently because of a sort of sympathy indeed when we skim a book with our eye we notice such unharmonious composition because we still imagine that someone be read it aloud to us and have a hard time pronounce these source of morals david hume why utility please jar sound so delicate be our sympathy beauty utility sympathy relax and unconstrained posture and motion be always beautiful an air of health and vigour be agreeable clothe that warm us without burden the bodythat cover us without imprison the limbsare welldesigned the feel of the affect person have a role in all our judgments of beauty communicate to the spectator similar touch of pain or pleasure so its not surprise that we cant make judgments about the character and conduct of men without consider the likely consequences of their action and the happiness or misery they bring to society what association of ideas could operate if the sympathy principle be totally inactive sympathy and morality if a man isnt affect by image of human happiness or miserybecause he be emotionally cold or narrowly selfish he must be equally indifferent to the image of virtue and vice and on the other hand we always find that a warm concern for the interest of our species be accompany by a delicate feel for all moral distinctionsa strong resentment of harm do to men a lively approval of their fare well people can be see to differ a great deal in this respect but noone be so entirely indifferent to the interest of his fellowcreatures that he doesnt have any sense of action as be morally good or bad because of the result they tend to produce if someone be confront by two candidates for his moral judgment one that be beneficial and another that be harmful to his species or community its not possible that he wont prefer the beneficial one however coolly and ascribe to it some measure of merit however small it be not possible if he wear a human heart hum exact phrase let us suppose someone who be ever so selfish with his own private interest occupy ever so much of his attention even this man in case where his own interest be not affect must inevitably feel some lean towards the good of mankind as the goal to choose other things be equal we surely take into consideration the happiness and misery of others when we be weigh the various motives for action and incline to the happiness side when no private concern draw us to seek our own advantage by harm our fellowcreatures and if the principles of humanity be capable in many instance of influence our action they must always have some authority over our sentiments see note on page and give us a general approval the horse whose flank be slim be handsomerand faster the athlete whose muscle have be well develop by exercise be better to look atand more likely to win outward appearance be never separate from usefulness everyone with any sense know this quintilian institute book ch how much good we expect to flow from someones conduct depend in part on how high his social rank be and on the quality of the relationshipsin private life in business in politics etcinto which he have enter if he fall short of our expectations we blame him for not be more useful and we blame him much more severely if anything positively bad have arise from his behaviour when theres a clash of interest between two countries we judge the merit of a statesman by how much good or bad have result for his own country from his action and advice without regard to their adverse effect on its enemies and rival his fellowcitizens be central to our thoughts when we be determine his moral character nature have implant in everyone a greater affection for his own country than for any other so we never expect any regard to distant nations when a competition arise another quite different reason for attend primarily to what the statesman achieve for his own country depend not on its be his own but on its be just one country be aware that the interest of mankind in general be better promote when every man attend to the good of his own community than they would be if everyone act on the basis of a loose indeterminate view about the good of the species the latter motivation doesnt provide one with a suitably limit object on which to exert oneself so no good can be expect to come from it source of morals david hume why utility please of what be useful to society and disapproval of what be dangerous or harmful the strength of these sentiments in this or that kind of case may be the subject of controversy but there cant be a viable theory or system that deny their existence a creature who be absolutely malicious and spiteful if there be such a thing in nature must be worse than merely indifferent to the image of vice and virtue all his sentiments must be invert and be directly opposite to the sentiments that prevail in the human species anything that contribute to the good of mankind will run contrary to the constant direction of his wish and desire and must therefore produce uneasiness and disapproval in him and on the other hand anything that be a source of disorder and misery in society must for the same reason be regard by him with pleasure and satisfaction timon of athens be call the manhater probably more because of his depression than because of inveterate malice one day he embrace alcibiades with great fondness say go on my boy acquire the confidence of the people then one day i foresee that youll be the cause of great calamities to them this story be from plutarch if the manicheans be right in their view that the universe be a battlefield between two principles or gods one good one and the other evil these two gods would have to have totally opposite sentiments concern human action as well as concern everything else every case of justice and humanity that please one of the gods because of its tendency to do good would displease the other all mankind so far resemble the good principle that our natural philanthropy incline us always to give the happiness of society preference over its misery and consequently to prefer virtue to its oppositeexcept at time when selfinterest or revenge or envy have pervert our disposition it may be that absolute unprovoked disinterested malice never find a place in any human breast but if it do it must there pervert all the sentiments of morals as well as the feel of humanity if neros cruelty have be entirely voluntary rather than be an effect of constant fear and resentment its obvious that his steady and uniform approval would have go to the cruel treacherous selfserving tigellinus rather than to his two noble advisors seneca and burrhus a statesman or patriot who serve our own country in our own time will always have a more passionate respect pay to him than one whose beneficial influence operate long ago or in distant countries thats because the good result from the generous humanity of the latter person be less closely connect with us be less brightly light for us and affect us with a less lively sympathy we may agree that their merit be equally great although our sentiments be not raise to the same height by both in a case like this our judgment correct the inequalities of our internal emotions and perceptions just as it preserve us from be mislead by the various image present to our external sense when the distance from us of an object be double it then throw on the eye a picture half the size of the previous one but we imagine that it look the same size in both situations because we know that its image would expand if we walk towards it and that this expansion would come not from the object itself but from our position in relation to it indeed without such a correction of appearancesboth in internal and external sentimentwe could never think or talk steadily about anything while our fluctuate situations continually for a similar reason our moral determinations or general judgments be base on the tendencies or expectable consequences of action and character not on the actual consequences that they happen to have though in our real feel or sentiment we cant help take a more favourable view of source of morals david hume why utility please vary the things we be talk about throw them into such different and contrary light and position the more we converse with other people and the larger the set of social interrelations that we maintain the more familiar well become with these general preferences and distinctions without which we could hardly speak intelligibly to each other every man selfinterest be special to himself and the aversions and desire arise from it cant be suppose to mean as much to anyone else so general language which be form for general use have to be mould on some more general view its way of use word expressive of praise or blame have to be make to fit sentiments arise from the general interest of the community grant that in most men these sentiments arent as strong as the ones concern private good still everyones feelingseven those of the most deprave and selfish peoplemust make some distinction between what be generally beneficial and what isnt attach the notion of good to generally beneficent conduct and the notion of evil to the contrary let admit that sympathy be much fainter than our concern for ourselves and that sympathy with persons far away be much fainter than sympathy with persons nearby but for precisely this reason we must in our calm think and speak about the character of men neglect all those differencessetting aside selfother nearfar and thennowand make our sentiments more public and social and its not just that we ourselves often change our situation in one of these respect in addition to that be constantly meet up with people whose situation be different from ours people we could never talk with if we remain constantly in the position and point of view that be special to ourselves so the interplay of sentiments in society and conversation make us form some general unchanging standard by which we may approve or disapprove of character and conduct the heart doesnt entirely adopt those general notions or regulate all its love and hatred by the universal abstract moral differences of vice and virtue without regard to whether something affect oneself or ones near and dear still these abstract moral differences have a lot of influence and serve well enough for discourse at least someone whose position join to his virtue make him really useful to society than of someone who exercise the social virtues only in good intentions and benevolent affections because his social position doesnt enable him to do any actual good for society it isnt hardand it be necessaryfor us to separate each persons character from how things happen to work out for him and have make this separation we judge these two persons to be morally on a par and give them the same general praise our judgment correct the appearance or try to but it cant entirely prevail over sentiment why be this peachtree say to be better than that one if not because it produce more or better fruit and wouldnt we give the same praise to it even if snail or vermin have destroy the peach before they be ripe in morals too isnt the tree know by the fruit and cant we easily distinguish nature from accident with the man as well as with the tree nature have wisely ordain that private connections should commonly prevail over universal view and considerations otherwise our affections and action would be dissipate and lose for lack of a proper limit object thus a small benefit do to ourselves or our near friends arouse more lively sentiments of love and approval than a great benefit do to a distant commonwealth but still we know to correct these inequalities by source of morals david hume why utility please which mean that they serve all our purpose in company in the pulpit on the stage and in the school thus in whatever light we take this subject the merit ascribe to the social virtues still appear to be uniform and arise chiefly from the concern that the natural sentiment of benevolence get us to have for the interest of mankind and society if we consider these drive that be build into the human makeup as we encounter them in daily experience and observation we must a priori conclude that a creature such as man cant be totally indifferent to the wellbeing or illbeing of his fellowcreatures and must be dispose to pronounce straight offin a case where nothing give him any particular biasthat what promote their happiness be good and what tend to their misery be bad say this without any qualifications or ifs or buts strictly an a priori belief owe nothing to experience whereas this one hume say rest on daily experience and observation but when on this page he speak of look at the matter a posteriori the standard opposite of a priori it seem that the distinction he be make be between view about morality that be base on the prior facts about human nature from view about morality that be base on facts about the consequences of morality the facts that be posterior to it here then be the faint rudiments or outline at least of a general distinction between action and to the extent that any individual persons humanity intensify his connection with those who be injure or benefit and the liveliness of his conception of their misery or happiness his consequent censure or approval will become correspondingly more vigorous a generous action barely mention in an old history book or a minor magazine neednt communicate any strong feel of applause and admiration when virtue be place at such a distance its like a star to the eye of reason it appear as luminous as the sun at noon ie as a matter of theory we think it be that bright but its so far away that it doesnt affect the sense with either light or heat bring this virtue nearer by our acquaintance or connection with the people involve or even just by an eloquent description of the case and then our hearts be immediately catch our sympathy enliven and our cool approval convert into the warmest sentiments of friendship and respect these seem to be necessary and certain consequences of the general principles of drive in human nature as reveal in common life and practice now let us run all this in the opposite direction consider the matter a posteriori think about consequences doesnt the merit of social virtue come in large measure from the feel of humanity that such virtue produce in the spectators it seem to be a plain matter of fact that the utility of somethingof anythingis a source of praise and approval that utility be constantly appeal to in all moral decisions about the merit or demerit of action the only source of the high respect pay to justice fidelity honour allegiance chastity inseparable from all the other social virtues humanity generosity charity friendliness mildness affability gentleness mercy and moderation and in short a foundation for the chief part of morals the part concern mankind as a whole it appear also that in our general approval of character and conduct the useful tendency of the social virtues doesnt move us through selfinterest but have a much more universal and extensive influence it appear that a tendency to public good and to the promote of peace harmony and think about them and retain a general standard of vice and virtue base chiefly on general usefulness these corrections be like the ones we perform in process what come to us through our sense order in society always engage us on the side of the social virtues by work on the benevolent force in the human makeup and it appear as an additional confirmation that these drive of humanity and sympathy enter so deeply into all our sentiments and have such a powerful influence that they can arouse the strongest censure and applause my present theory be the simple result of all these inferences each of which seem to be base on uniform experience and observation if you arent sure whether theres anything in our nature give us humanity or a concern for others think about this we see in countless case that anything tend to promote the interest of society be very highly approve of by people in general that should teach you that we have a drive to benevolence and that it be strong because nothing could possibly please us as a mean to an end if we didnt care in the least about the end on the other hand if you arent sure whether there be implant in our nature anything make us engage in moral blame and approval think about this we see in countless case the influence of humaneness from that you should infer that everything that promote the interest of society must communicate pleasure and what be harmful must give uneasiness but when these different line of think come together in establish the same conclusion dont they put that conclusion beyond the reach of any doubt or denial but i hope to provide further confirmation for this theory when i present other sentiments of admiration and respect that come from the same source or from ones like it qualities useful to ourselves it seem clear that when we examine a quality or habit that someone have if it show up as be in any respect bad for the person in question or if it incapacitate him for business and action we immediately blame it and count it among his fault and imperfections laziness negligence lack of order and method obstinacy fickleness rashness credulitynoone ever regard any of these qualities as neutral feature of someones character let alone praise them as accomplishments or virtues their downside immediately strike our eye and give us the sentiment of pain and disapproval its generally agree that no quality be absolutely either blameable or praiseworthy ie theres no quality that be blameable whenever it occur and none that be praiseworthy whenever it occur the moral status of a give instance of a quality depend on the degree to which the quality be present in it the aristotelians say that what make something virtuous be its be appropriately between two extremes but that isnt seriously in conflict with my view because this between position be chiefly determine by usefulness take the example of speed in business if someone isnt fast enough hell make no progress in any project if he go too fast hell act precipitately and wont coordinate his do properly with those of other people thats the sort of reason we use in decide what be the proper and commendable middle in all moral and prudential contexts and we never lose sight of the advantage that result from any character or habit these advantage be enjoy by the person who have the character or habit we be judge so whatever it be that make the view of them agreeable to us the spectators and prompt our admiration and approval it cant be selflove the star passage expand what hume write in ways that the small dot convention cant easily indicate it add nothing to the content someone might think that its our selflove that be at work cooperate with our imagination thus our imagination turn us into the other person make us imagine that we be him and be get for ourselves the benefit of the valuable qualities that really belong to him then imagination immediately whip us back into ourselves and make us love and esteem the person while see him as different from us but this cant be right our imagination lack the strength to perform the first operation and the speed to perform the second view and sentiments that be so opposite to know truth and to each other could never be hold at the same time by the same person so we can rule out the suspicion that what look like expressions of benevolence be really selfish what drive our feel be something quite different something that give us a concern for the wellbeing of the person we be think about when his natural talents and acquire abilities give us the prospect of his rise higher advance in his career acquire renown have prosperous success steadily master the mishaps that fate send his way and carry out great or advantageous undertake we be impress by these agreeable image and feel arise in us a satisfaction and respect towards him the ideas of happiness joy triumph and prosperity be connect with every detail of his character and spread through our mind a please sentiment of sympathy and humanity try this supposition a person whose fundamental nature be such that he have no kind of concern for his fellowcreatures and regard the choice between happiness and misery for all sentient be with utter indifferenceeven more so than the choice between two colour for a curtain when he can hardly tell them apart if he be ask to choose between the prosperity of nations and their ruin he would stand like the famous philosophical assequidistant from two indistinguishable bale of hayirresolute and undetermined between equal motives or rather like the we can go so far as to say that there be no human creature to whom the appearance of happiness doesnt give pleasure and the appearance of misery doesnt give uneasiness set aside case where envy or revenge enter the picture this seem inseparable from our makeup and constitution but its only the more generous mind that be prompt by this to try hard to procure the good of others and to have a real passion for their welfare with men of narrow and ungenerous spirit the sympathy i have be speak of be nothing more than a slight feel of the imagination which serve only to arouse sentiments of satisfaction or censure and to affect what kinds of adjectives they will apply to the person a clutch miser for instance praise industry and frugality extremely highly even in others and rank them above all the other virtues he know the good that result from them and feel that sort of happinessthe good will come of this sort of happinesswith a livelier sympathy than he would get from think about any other virtue yet it may be that he wouldnt part with a shill to make the fortune of the industrious man whom he praise so highly same ass between two piece of wood or of marble with no inclination or lean to either side i think it must be grant that the person i have suppose be absolutely unconcerned for the public good of a community or the private utility of others would look on every quality however harmful or beneficial to society or to the person who have it with the same indifference as he would look on the most common and uninteresting object but if instead of this imagine monster we suppose a man to form a judgment or make a decision in the caseie the choice between the prosperity of nations and their ruin there be for him a plain basis for preference other things be equal and even if his choice be cool his heart selfish and the people concern remote from him there must still be for him a choice or distinction between what be useful and what be harmful now this usefulharmful distinction be the same in all its part as the moral distinction whose basis have be so often and so fruitlessly search for the sentiment of morals and the sentiment of humanity be favour by the same endowments of the mind down to the finest detail a temperament that be give to intense feel of either of these kinds will also be give to intense feel of the other kind and when the object come closer or be more closely connect that enliven each sentiment to the same degree by all the rule of science therefore we must conclude that these sentiments be basically the same since in every tiny detail they be govern by the same laws and move by the same object why do scientists infer with the greatest certainty that the moon be keep in its orbit by the same force of gravity that make body fall near the surface of the earth because when these effect be calculate they be find to be similar and equal shouldnt this argument be as convince in moral theories as in natural ones this occurrence of moral mean have to do with human behaviour hum question be not shouldnt this be as convince in ethics as it be in empirical science and be more like shouldnt this be as convince in psychology as it be in physics theres no need for me to produce lengthy detail evidence that any quality that be useful to its possessor be approve of and that any thats harmful to its possessor be censure the least reflection on what we experience in everyday life will be sufficient ill just provide a few instance in order to remove all doubt and hesitationif i can discretion the quality that be most need for carry out any useful enterprise be discretionbeing careful in our interrelations with others attend properly to our own character and to theirs weigh each detail of the project we be undertake and employ the surest and safest mean for achieve any end or purpose to people like oliver cromwell and the french churchman and politician and schemer cardinal de retz discretion may appear to be an aldermanlike virtue a virtue suitable for a conscientious town councillor as jonathan swift call it it might really be a fault or imperfection in them be incompatible with the vast project to which their courage and ambition prompt them but in ordinary everyday life no virtue be more need not just to succeed but to avoid spectacular failure for someone who lack discretion his have many other virtues and strengths may be fatal to him if it werent too perfect for human nature i would say that the best character be that which be not sway by moods of any kind but alternately employ enterprise and caution depend on which be useful for the particular purpose intend that be the kind of excellence that an historian attribute to marshal turenne in his service to louis xiv the boldness of his military enterprises increase campaign by campaign until he reach the age and stage at which know all about war from long experience he could advance with greater firmness and security along the wellknown road machiavelli remark about two military leaders in ancient rome that fabius be cautious and scipio enterprising each succeed because when he have command the state of affairs in rome be right for his talents but both would have fail if the situations have be reverse it be good to be in a situation that suit ones frame of mind but a more excellent person be the one who can suit his frame of mind to any situation industriousness what need be there to praise hard work and to extol its advantage in the acquisition of power and riches the tortoise accord to the fable by sheer perseverance win the race against the much faster hare when a man time be well husband it be like a cultivate field a few acres of it produce more useful stuff than do extensive provinces that have the richest soil but be overrun with weed and brambles husband mean manage with a suggestion of the management of a farm frugality and prodigality a prodigal be someone who spend extravagantly the standard label for jesuss parable of the prodigal son refer not to the sons leave home and then return but to his waste his substance in riotous live but theres not much chance of succeed in life or even of survive in tolerable condition unless one be reasonably frugal for someone who be not frugal the heap of his money instead of increase decrease day by day this leave him intensely unhappy because if he couldnt keep his expense within the confine of a large income he certainly wont able to live contentedly on a small one plato write that the souls of men who be inflame with impure appetites when they lose the body that be their only source of satisfaction hover about the earth haunt the place where their body be burn and hanker to recover their lose organs of sensation phaedo ce it be like that with worthless prodigals who have spend their fortune in wild debauch they still have the organs of sensation because they arent dead yet but they have lose the financial mean to gratify their appetites and so they gatecrash wellprovided dinners and party of pleasure hat even by the dissolute and despise even by fool at one extreme of frugalityor more accurately of the scale that have frugality near the midpointis miserliness this be rightly censure for two reason it deprive a man of all use of his riches and it get in the way of hospitality and every social enjoyment at the other end of the scale be prodigality which be commonly more hurtful to the man himself which of these extremes be regard as worse than the other depend on the temperament of the person who be do the judge vir tues with complex moral source qualities often get their merit from complicate source honesty fidelity and truthfulness be praise because of their immediate tendency to promote the interest of society but once they have be establish on this foundation these virtues be also regard as advantageous to the person who have them and as the source of the trust and confidence that a man must have if he be to get any respect in life someone who lack these three virtues be find to be contemptible because he forget the duty he owe to himself and odious because he forget the duty he owe to society this consideration may be one chief source of the intense blame attach to unchastity in a woman the greatest respect that women can get come from their fidelity and a woman who fail in this become cheap and vulgar lose her rank and be expose to every insult the smallest failure in this respect be enough to blast her character she have so many opportunities for secretly indulge her sexual appetites that the only way we can be sure of her be for her to have absolute modesty and reserve and once the wall have be breach it can hardly ever be fully repair if a man behave with cowardice on one occasion brave conduct on a later occasion will restore his reputation but if a woman once behave in a dissolute fashion what can she then do to make us sure that she have form better resolutions and have enough selfcontrol to act on them its agree that men be equal in their desire but few succeed in achieve it one large cause of this be the lack of the strength of mind need to enable a man to resist the temptation of present ease or pleasure and carry him forward in the search of profit and enjoyment further on in the future when we look in a general way on the object of our like and dislike we decide on certain rule of conduct and certain measure of preference for one kind of object over another these decisions result from our calm passions and inclinationsfor what else could declare any object to be desirable or undesirable and yet they be often say in a natural misuse of word to be decisions reach by pure reason and reflection but when some of these object come nearer to us in time or in space or acquire the advantage of be see in a more flatter light or from a more favourable angle which catch the heart or imagination our general resolutions be frequently defeat a small enjoyment be prefer and last shame and sorrow be bring down on us and however much wit and eloquence poets expend in celebrate present pleasure and reject all longdistance view of fame health or fortune it be obvious that this practice of favour the present at the expense of the future be the source of all dissoluteness and disorder all repentance and misery a man with a strong and determine mind stick to his general resolutions and isnt seduce by the allurements of pleasure or terrify by threats of pain but keep his eye steadily on the distant pursuits by which he ensure both his happiness and his honour a certain degree of selfsatisfaction be an advantage equally for the fool and for the wise man but there be no other charactertrait and no other aspect of life where the fool and the wise man be on an equal foot business book conversationa fool be totally unfit for all of these and remain a useless burden on the earth except for the possibly useful coarse drudgery that he be condemn to by his position in life thats why we find that men be extremely protective of this aspect of their character there be many examples of men openly and fully declare their own profligacy and treachery but there be no examples of men placidly accept that they be regard as ignorant and stupid let alone examples of men loudly declare their ignorance and stupidity no affectionate connection be strong enough to survive the disgust arise from this character ie from the belief that some person that one have deal with be stupid and ignorant actually there be one exception to what i have just say it be the affection of parent for their offspring which be the strongest and most indissoluble bond in nature love itself which can survive treachery ingratitude malice and infidelity be immediately extinguish by stupidity when it be perceive and acknowledge the passion of love be not diminish by ugliness and old age more than it be by stupidity that be a measure of how dreadful we find the ideas of an utter incapacity for any project or undertake and of continue error and misconduct in life think about the question that can be ask about which of two kinds of understand be more excellent quickness or slowness on the uptake the ability to penetrate far into a subject straight off with no ability to do anything through study or the opposite character which have to work everything out through hard concentrate work a clear head or a richly inventive one profundity of think or sureness of judgment obviously we cant answer any of these question without consider which qualities equip a man best for the world and carry him furthest in anything he undertake if refine sense and exalt sense arent as useful as common sense their rarity and novelty and the nobleness of their object compensate somewhat for this and make them the admiration of mankind in the same way gold be less serviceable than iron but be much more valuable than iron because of its scarcity memory the defect of judgment cant be make up for by any skills or inventions but defect of memory can often be make up for in business and in scholarship by be methodical and hardworking and by thoroughness in write everything down we hardly ever hear a short memory give as a reason for a man failure in any undertake but in ancient time when no man could rise to prominence without a talent for speak and when the audience be too delicate to put up with such crude undigested harangue as todays impromptu orators offer to public assemblies the faculty of memory be of the utmost consequence and be accordingly much more value than it be these days almost every great genius who be mention in antiquity be celebrate for this talent and cicero include it in his list of the sublime qualities of caesar himself he have talent intelligence memory write skill attentiveness reflective judgment diligence particular customs and manners make a difference to how useful a personal quality be they also make a difference to its merit particular situations and events have to some extent the same influence someone who have the talents and accomplishments that suit his social position and his profession will always be more admire than someone to whom the luck of the draw have assign a social place that be wrong for him the private or selfish virtues be in this respect more arbitrary than the public and social ones in other respect they may be less liable to doubt and controversy in recent years in great britain men in active life have spout so much about their public spirit and theoreticians and scholars have go on so much about benevolence that men of the world be apt without any bad intention to reveal a sullen incredulity about those moral endowments and even sometimes to deny that they exist at all they have be encourage in this attitude by the fact that many false claim to public spirit or benevolence have be detect this seem to me to resemble something that happen in the ancient world the perpetual cant of the stoics and cynics concern virtue their splendid claim to virtue and its small part in their live make people disgust with virtue as well as with them and lucian a very moral writer except for be licentious with regard to pleasure couldnt write about the muchboastedof virtue without betray symptoms of bad temper and irony hume have a footnote here quote in greek some of lucians turn of phrase but surely this peevish faultfinding wherever it come from can never be take so far as to make us deny the existence of every species of merit and all distinctions of manners and behaviour there be charactertraits whose very name force one to agree that they have meritdiscretion caution enterprise industry assiduity frugality economy good sense prudence discernment and besides these there be many others to which the most determine scepticism cant for a moment refuse the tribute of praise and approval temperance sobriety patience constancy perseverance forethought considerateness the ability to keep secrets orderliness persuasiveness in speech presence of mind quickness of conception ease of expressionthese and a thousand more of the same kind wont ever be deny by anyone to be excellencies and perfections their merit consist in their tendency to serve the person who have them with no grand claim to public and social merit and that make us less grudge in admit their claim and we readily put them on the list of praiseworthy qualities although we arent aware of this at the time by grant the merit of those characteristics we have pave the way for all the other moral excellences so that we cant consistently hesitate any longer about the existence and moral status of disinterested benevolence patriotism and humanity we have before us now the selfregarding virtues that i list earlier and the social virtues of justice and beneficence you might at first glance think it would be easier to represent theoretically as disguise selflove than to represent in that way but the truth turn out to be the exact opposite to make a case for s be disguise selflove we need only say that whatever conduct promote the good of the community be love praise and admire by the community because of the good it bring to the community and thus to every member of it in fact whats be talk about here be not selflove but gratitude and the distinction between these be pretty obvious still a superficial reasoner might overlook it so those who be sceptical about justice and benevolence have some grind to stand on at least for a moment in contrast with that qualities that tend only to the advantage of the person who have them without any reference to us or to the community be nevertheless admire and value by us and the community what theory or system be there that will account for this sentiment in term of selflove derive it from that favourite origin it seem that we have to admit that the happiness and misery of others be not matter of entire indifference to us and that the view of happiness whether in its cause or its effect give us a secret joy and satisfaction comparable with to take a humdrum example the satisfaction of see sunshine on a well cultivate field while the appearance of misery affect us in the kind of way in which a dark raincloud or a barren landscape throw a melancholy damp over our imagination and once this concession have be make the difficulty be over we can hope that from here on a natural unforced interpretation of the phenomena of human life will prevail among all those who work on moral theory i have be discuss the way our sentiments of respect and esteem for a person arise from his qualities of mind it would be a good idea now to examine how these sentiments of ours be influence by a persons bodily endowments and by whatever advantage he haseg inherit wealththrough the luck of the draw our aim will be to see whether these phenomena strengthen or weaken my theory it will naturally be expectedand it be suppose by all the ancient moraliststhat physical beauty will be similar in some respect to beauty of the mind and that every kind of esteem we have for a man will have something similar in its origin whether it arise from his mental endowments or from his exterior circumstances one considerable source of beauty in any animal obviously be the advantage it get from the particular structure of its bodythe advantage in the particular way of life that nature have destine the animal for the best proportion of a horse as describe by xenophon and virgil be the same ones that be accept today by our modern horsedealers because they have the same foundation namely experience of what be detrimental or useful in the animal broad shoulder a lank belly firm joint taper legs all these be beautiful in our species because they be sign of force and vigour ideas of usefulness and its opposite though they dont entirely settle what be handsome or ugly be clearly the source of a considerable part of our approval or dislike in ancient time bodily strength and dexterity be much more esteem and value than they be today because back then they be much more useful and important in war than they be today we obviously find this in homer and the poets but even the ancient historians mention bodily strength among the accomplishments of the heroes they write about even the theban general epaminondas whom the historians acknowledge to be the greatest hero statesman and general of all the greeks be praise for his physical strength he give another example pompey as describe by sallust then this be like what i say about memory physical strength like memory be more importantly useful in ancient time than it be now sexual impotence bring down on a person derision and contempt from women as well as men thats because of how very unuseful impotence be the unfortunate sufferer from it be see as be deprive of an important kind of pleasure and at the same time disable from give such pleasure to others if a woman be barren that be hold against her because barrenness be a kind of inutility a way of not be useful but our reaction to barrenness be not as intense as our reaction to impotence and my theory make very obvious the reason for this namely that the disadvantage come from barrenness be less extensive that those that come from impotence there be no rule in paint or sculpture more indispensable than that of balance the figure and place them with the greatest exactness on their proper centre of gravity a figure that isnt balance properly be ugly because it give to grasp the idea of perfect merit that prevail in those time look at what diodorus siculus write about epaminondas in other illustrious men youll observe that each possess some one shin quality that be the foundation of his fame but in epaminondas all the virtues be find unitedbodily strength eloquence of expression vigour of mind lack of interest in riches gentleness of disposition andthe main thingcourage and conduct in war all men be equally liable to pain and disease and sickness and may again recover health and ease because these circumstances dont distinguish one man from another they arent a source of pride or humility respect or contempt but compare our own species to superior onessuch as the angels that theologians tell us aboutis a very humble practice remind us that we be all so liable to diseases and infirmities while the angels arent and theologians accordingly go on about this in an attempt to lower our selfsatisfaction and vanity hum next sentence they would have more success if the common bend of our thoughts be not perpetually turn to compare ourselves with others he may have mean they would have more success in this if we werent already familiar with that contrast because we have often compare ourselves with others include angels us the disagreeable ideas of fall harm and pain a disposition or cast of mind that qualify a man to rise in the world and advance his fortune be entitle to esteem and respect as i have already explain so it can naturally be suppose that the actual possession of riches and authority will have a considerable influence over these sentiments if we look for an hypothesis through which we can explain people respect for the rich and powerful the only satisfactory one well find be the theory that this respect come from the spectators enjoyment of the image he get of prosperity happiness ease plenty authority and the gratification of every appetite there be other theories of course but they dont do the job for example some philosophers make so much of selflove that they consider it to be the source of every sentiment but it be clearly inadequate for this purpose in the absence of any goodwill or friendship it be hard to see what could be our basis for hop for advantage from the riches of others yet we naturally respect the rich even before they reveal any such favourable disposition towards us we have these same sentiments even when we be so far out of the persons sphere of activity that we cant even think that he could do us any good in all civilize nations a prisoner of war be treat with a respect appropriate to his social level and obviously a man riches go a long way towards settle what his social status be if birth and rank come into this also that provide yet another an argument for my thesis when we call someone a man of birth what do we mean but that he be descend from a long succession of rich and powerful ancestors so that we esteem him because of his connection with people we esteem thus his ancestors be respect partly because of their riches although we cant expect anything from them because they be dead i dont have to go so far as prisoners of war or the dead to find examples of this disinterested not self interest respect for riches look carefully at things that happen all the time in ordinary life and conversation let suppose that a man who be reasonably well off be introduce to a company of strangers he naturally treat them with different degrees of respect depend on what he be tell about their different fortunes and condition yet he cant possibly think he will get any monetary advantage from any of them and perhaps wouldnt accept it even if he could when a traveller be admit into company he always meet with a degree of civility that be proportional to what his attendants and his gear indicate about how rich he be in short the different social rank of men be to a large extent regulate by riches and that hold for superiors as well as inferiors for strangers as well as people we know why do we want riches for ourselves because they be a mean of gratify our present or possible future appetites why do someones be rich create esteem for him in others what i have be say seem to force us to the conclusion that the same answer hold its because riches be a mean of gratify appetites this indeed be their very nature or essence they be directly connect with the commodities conveniences and pleasures of life when that connection be brokenas with an iou from a bankrupt banker or gold on a desert islandriches arent riches any or he may have mean theyd have more success in this if we pay attention to their contrast between ourselves and angels rather than busily compare ourselves with other people the infirmities of old age be upset because we can compare ourselves with the young more when we approach a man who be as we say at his ease or today perhaps in comfortable circumstances we be present with the please ideas of abundance satisfaction cleanliness warmth a cheerful house elegant furniture good servants and whatever be desirable in food drink and clothe when a poor man appear on the other hand our imagination be immediately strike by disagreeable image of want poverty drudgery dirty furniture coarse or rag clothe disgust food and nasty drink what else do we mean by say that one be rich the other poor and as respect in one case and contempt in the other be the natural consequence of those different situations in life it be easy to see that these facts throw light on and help to confirm the theory i have present regard all moral distinctions consider a man who have cure himself of all ridiculous assumptions and be fully sincerely and steadily convincedfrom experience as well as from philosophythat the difference of fortune make less difference in happiness than most people think this man wont measure out degrees of esteem accord to the incomes of the people he know he may outwardly defer to the great lord more than to the peasant because riches be the most convenient because the most fix and determinate source of distinction but his inner sentiments be govern by mens personal character rather than by the accidental and whimsical favour of fortune in most countries of europe the chief source of distinction be family ie hereditary wealth mark with title and symbols from the king in england more respect be pay to present opulence and plenty each practice have its advantage and disadvantage the disadvantage of respect birth be that inactive spiritless mind remain in haughty idleness and dream of nothing but pedigrees and genealogies the advantage be that those who have energies and ambition put them to work in the search for honour and authority reputation and favour the disadvantage of focus respect on riches be that this encourage corruption bribery plunder the advantage be that it encourage arts manufacture commerce and agriculture the family prejudice be more favourable to military virtue so that its more suit to monarchies the riches prejudice be the chief spur to hard work so that it agree better with a republican government theres something extraordinary and seemingly inexplicable in the way our emotions behave when we consider the fortune and circumstances of others very often someone elses advancement and prosperity produce envy which have a strong mixture of hatred and arise chiefly from compare ourselves with the other person yet at the very same time or at least rapidly alternate with the envy we may feel the passion of respect which be a kind of affection or goodwill with a mixture of humility on the other hand the misfortunes of our fellows often cause pity which have in it a strong mixture of goodwill this sentiment of pity be closely relate to contempt which be a kind of dislike with pride mix in i point out these facts just as interest to think about for those who be study the human condition for my present purpose all i need be the fact that power and riches commonly cause respect and poverty and meanness cause contempt though in particular contexts the emotions of envy and of pity may enter the picture qualities immediately agreeable to ourselves cheerfulness have you ever spend an even with sad serious people and see what happen when a goodhumoured and lively person join the group how quickly the conversation come to life and cheerfulness diffuse itself over everyones face talk and behaviour if so youll have no trouble agree that cheerfulness carry great merit with it and naturally draw in the goodwill of mankind indeed no other quality more readily communicate itself to all around because no other have a greater propensity to display itself in cheerful talk and pleasant entertainment the flame spread through the whole circle and the most sullen and gloomy be often ignite by it i have trouble agree with the latin poet horace that the melancholy hate the merry because it have always be my experience than when the jollity be moderate and decent serious people be all the more delight because it dissipate the gloom that usually oppress them and give them an unusual enjoyment the power of cheerfulness to communicate itself and to draw approval show us that there be another set of mental qualities which without be useful or tend to produce further good for the community or for the person who have the quality give satisfaction to the beholders and procure friendship and respect have one of these qualities feel good other people enter into the same mood and catch the sentiment by a contagion or natural sympathy and as we cant help love whatever give us pleasure a kindly emotion arise towards the person who give so much satisfaction as between a cheerful person and a melancholy deject sullen anxious person the former be more enliven to be with his presence give us more serene contentment and enjoyment and we find it more agreeable to enter into his feel and disposition that explain our affection and approval for the cheerful person and our aversion and disgust towards the gloomy one few men would envy the character that caesar attribute to cassius in shakespeares famous play he love no play as thou dost anthony he hear no music seldom he smile and smile in such a sort as if he mock himself and scorn his spirit that could be move to smile at any thing just before this caesar have say that such men be dangerous and so they commonly be but also they can never become agreeable to others or contribute to social entertainment because they have so little enjoyment within themselves in all civilize nations a like for pleasure if accompany by temperance and decency have always be regard as a considerable merit even in the greatest men and in those of inferior rank and character it be need even more the french writer saintévremond give an attractive picture of this aspect of his frame of mind i love virtue without austerity pleasure without effeminacy life without fear its end everyone be from time to time affect with all the disagreeable passionsfear anger dejection grief melancholy anxiety and so on but to the extent that these be natural and universal they make no difference between one man and another and can never be the object of blame its only when a persons temperament give him a general tendency to have one or more of these disagreeable passions that they disfigure his character create a sentiment of disapproval in the spectator by make him uneasy sublimity in this next paragraph disdain of slavery mean proud refusal to knuckle under to anyone your disdain of slavery be your attitude to your be subject to someone else you may not dislike the idea of my be subject to someone else also both here and further on slavery cover all sort of knucklingunder include ones that arent as extreme as slavery in our literal sense of the word who be not strike with any notable instance of greatness of mind or dignity of character with elevation of sentiment disdain of slavery and the noble pride and spirit that arise from conscious virtue longinus write that sublimity be often nothing but the echo or image of magnanimity ie greatness of mind and when someone manifest this quality even if he doesnt utter a word he arouse our applause and admiration an example of this be the famous silence of ajax in the odyssey a silence that express a nobler disdain and more resolute indignation than any language can convey go cry alexander to his soldier who have refuse to follow him to india go and tell your countrymen that you leave alexander complete the conquest of the world the prince of condé who always admire this passage comment alexander abandon by his soldier among barbarians not yet fully subdue felt in himself such a dignity and right of empire that he couldnt believe it possible that anyone would refuse to obey him it make no difference to him whether he be in europe or in asia among greeks or among persians wherever he find men he expect to find subject in corneilles tragedy médée a friend advise medea to be cautious and submissive list the distress of that unfortunate heroine and ask her what do you have to support yourself against your many implacable enemies she reply myself myself i say and that be enough boileau rightly recommend this passage as an instance of true sublimity when phocion the modest gentle phocion be be lead to execution he turn to one of his fellowsufferers who be lament his own hard fate and say isnt it glory enough for you that you die with phocion this be from plutarchs live phocion contrast that with the picture tacitus draw of vitellius no longer emperor prolong his period of shame because of his wretched love of life hand over to the merciless rabble toss punch and kick around force by a dagger hold under his chin to raise his head and expose himself to everyones abuse what abject infamy what low humiliation yet even here say tacitus he show some symptoms of a mind not wholly degenerate to a tribune who insult him he say i be still your emperor this paragraph use mean in a sense that be current in hum time but not today a beggar ask whiningly can you spare a dime and i say no my answer may show that i be mean in our sense the beggar question show that he be mean in hum sense in our ordinary everyday deal with one another we never excuse a total lack of spirit and dignity of character ie of a proper sense of what be due to ones self this vice constitute what we properly call meanness when a man submit to the basest slavery see note above in order to gain his end fawn on those who mistreat him or degrade himself by intimacies and familiarities with tacitus histories he start this narration thus as he be lead away with his clothe all tattered a dreadful spectacle many curse him and noone weep the ugliness of his exit have drive out compassion to get a proper sense of this way of think he have to make allowance for the ancient maxim everyone have a right to dispose of his life and after anyones life become dishonorable he have not only a right but a duty to part with it undeserving inferiors the first two of these be somewhat connect with one another but not with the third which be an entirely different way of shamefully let oneself down a certain degree of nobleminded pride or selfvalue be so much need for a worthwhile life that when someones mind lack it we find that upset in the same way as we be upset by someones lack a nose or an eye courage the usefulness of courage both to the public and to the person who have it be an obvious foundation of merit but if you think about it youll see that this quality have a special shine on it that come not from its consequences but wholly from itself and from the noble elevation that always accompany it the figure of courage as depict by painters and poets display in each feature a sublimity and dare confidence that catch the eye draw the affections and through sympathy spread a similar sublimity of feel over every spectator in a speech by the athenian orator and politician demosthenes defend his administration and justify the obstinate love of liberty with which he have inspire the athenians he represent philip of macedon in these glow colour i behold philip the very philip with whom you have be fight pursue empire and dominion while expose himself to every woundhis eye gore his neck twist his arm and thigh piercedwhatever part of his body fortune should seize on he cheerfully give it up provide that he could live in honour and renown with what remain shall it be say that he bear in pella a place that use to be mean and ignoble be inspire with such high ambition and thirst for fame while you who be athenians and on he go these praise arouse the most lively admiration and we can see that the view the orator present doesnt bring in anything about the future advantageous consequences of philips valour it doesnt go beyond the hero himself hume now give three examples of people who value courage more highly than civilise people would in modern time the ancient romans call courage virtue thereby rat it higher than any other moral qualities the suevi as report by tacitus go in for elaborate hairstyling not for romantic purpose but to frighten their enemies the scythians as report by herodotus admire most the warriors who have the largest decorative cloths make from their enemies scalp he continue that show how greatly among the scythians as well as many other nations bravery in war destroy the sentiments of humanity which be surely a much more useful and attractive virtue we can see indeed that in all the uncultivated nations that havent yet have a full experience of the advantage that come with beneficence justice and the social virtues courage be regard as the predominant excellence the one that be most celebrate by poets recommend by parent and instructors and admire by people in general the ethics of homer be in this respect very different from those the absence of a virtue can often be a vice and sometimes one of the worst sort meanness be one example of that ingratitude be another where we expect a beauty the disappointment give us an uneasy sensation and produce a real ugliness and abjectness of characterie meannessis disgust and contemptible in another way also where a man have no sense of value in himself we arent likely to rate him any higher and if someone who crouch to his superiors be insolent to his inferiors as often happen the second kind of behaviour doesnt cancel out the first it add to it make the man still more odious through the addition of a further vice see of fénelon his elegant modern imitator they be well suit to an age in whichas report by thucydidesone hero could ask another be you a robber without give offence not so long ago similar ethics prevail also in many barbarous part of ireland if we can believe the poet edmund spensers judicious account of the state of affairs in that kingdom tranquillity belong to the same class of virtues as courage be the undisturbed philosophical tranquillity that enable one to rise above pain sorrow anxiety and each assault of bad luck conscious of his own virtue say the philosophers the tranquil sage elevate himself above every chance happen and from his secure place in the temple of wisdom he look down on inferior mortals engage in pursuit of honour riches reputation and every frivolous enjoyment no doubt a fullstrength version of this attitude be far too magnificent for human nature but the attitude carry with it a grandeur that seize the spectator and arouse his admiration and the nearer we can come in practice to this sublime tranquillity and evenmindedness not to be confuse with the insensibility produce by stupor the more secure enjoyment we shall attain within ourselves and the more greatness of mind we shall reveal to the world this philosophical tranquillity may indeed be consider as just one form of magnanimity greatness of mind look at socrateshis perpetual serenity and contentment amidst the greatest poverty and domestic trouble his resolute contempt see note on page for riches and his magnanimous care for preserve liberty while refuse all help from his friends and disciples so as to avoid even the very mild dependence that consist of be oblige to someone who doesnt admire him among the ancients the philosophical heroes as well as the military and patriotic ones have a grandeur and force of sentiment that astonish our narrow mindswe quickly reject it as extravagant and supernatural but then suppose the ancients have an accurate representation of usand especially of the degree of humanity clemency order tranquillity and other social virtues that we have achieve in the administration of government in modern time they would have have good reason to regard our way of do things as romantic and incredible that be how natureor rather culturehas handle the uneven distribution of excellences and virtues in those different age benevolence i have already explain the merit that benevolence have because of its usefulness its tendency to promote the good of mankind and thats certainly the source of a considerable part of everyones esteem for to it but that be not the only thing that make benevolence attractive to us the softness and tenderness of this sentiment its engage endearments its fond expressions its delicate attentions and all the flow of mutual confidence and concern that enter into a warm attachment of love and friendshipthese feel be delightful in themselves so they be bind to communicate themselves to the spectators and melt them into the same fondness and delicacy a tear naturally start in our eye when we see a warm sentiment of this kind our breast heave our heart be agitate and every humane tender activator in our makeup be set in motion and give us the he write it be a common custom among their gentlemens sons that as soon as they be able to use their weapons they immediately round up three or four stragglers or footsoldiers and wander idly around the country with them steal only food until eventually the young gentleman run up against real resistance and have to cope with it and once this be know he be regard as a man of worth in whom there be courage purest and most satisfactory enjoyment when poets describe the elysian field whose bless inhabitants have no need of each others assistance they still represent them as maintain constant exchange of love and friendship and soothe our mind with the please image of these soft and gentle passions who would want to live amidst perpetual wrangle scold and mutual reproach the roughness and harshness of those emotions disturb and displease us we suffer by contagion and sympathy see note on page and we cant remain indifferent spectators even if we be certain that the angry passions we be observe wont have any harmful consequences here be proof positive that benevolence doesnt get all its merit from its usefulness we sometimes gently blame someone for be too good we say this if he exceed his part in society and take his care for others beyond the proper bound similarly we say that someone be too highspirited too dare too unconcerned about fortunethese be reproach that really basically imply more admiration than many speeches of praise do be accustom to score the merit and demerit of character chiefly by their useful or harmful tendencies we cant help apply the language of blame when we encounter a sentiment that be so intense as to be harmful but it can happen at the same time that the sentiments noble elevation or its lovable tenderness so grip the heart that it increase our friendship and concern for the person some other examples the amours and attachments of henry iv of france during the civil war between protestants and catholics frequently hurt his interest and the cause he be fight for but many peoplethe young the amorous and perhaps others who can sympathize with the tender passionswill agree that this be a weakness in him while also admit that its what chiefly endear that hero to them and interest them in his fortunes the excessive bravery and resolute inflexibility of charles xii ruin his own country and make trouble for all his neighbour but those personal characteristics of his have such splendour and greatness in their appearance that they strike us with admiration we might even to some extent approve of them if it werent for the fact that they sometimes reveal clear symptoms of madness the athenians claim to have invent agriculture and laws and they always value themselves extremely because of the benefit these two inventions bring to the whole race of mankind they also boast and with reason of their warlike enterprises particularly against the innumerable fleet and armies of persians that invade greece during the reign of darius and xerxes as for the usefulness of these two achievements one peaceful and the other military theres simply no comparison and yet we find that the orators who have write so elaborately in praise of that famous city have chiefly triumph in display its warlike achievements lysias thucydides plato and isocrates all reveal that same preference or bias this attitude to military glory though it be condemn by calm reason and reflection seem to be very natural in the mind of man we can see that the great charm of poetry consist in lively picture that it draw of the sublime passions magnanimity courage disdain of fortune or of the tender affections love and friendship which warm the heart and spread through someone may be blame for an excess of cheerfulness but this could hardly happen if it werent for the fact that dissolute mirth without no proper cause or subject be a sure mark of folly which make it disgust it similar sentiments and emotions in fact we find that all kinds of passion even disagreeable kinds like grief and anger convey satisfaction when arouse by poetry but the more elevate or softer affections have a special influence and bring pleasure from more than one cause or source not to mention that they alone interest us in the fortune of the persons represent or create in us any esteem and affection for their character hume say that involve a mechanism of nature that it isnt easy to explain his own attempt to explain it be his essay tragedy and can it possibly be doubt that the poets ability to move the passions be a very considerable merit and that enhance by its extreme rarity it can exalt the person who have it above every character of the age in which he live the prudence skill steadiness and benign government of the roman emperor augustus adorn with all the splendour of his noble birth and imperial crown be not enough to bring his fame up to the level of virgils though the fame of virgil be support by nothing but the divine beauties of his poetical genius i have present examples of the various species of merit that be value for the immediate pleasure they give to the person who have them this sentiment of approval isnt in any way base on usefulness or future beneficial consequences yet it be similar in kind to the other sentiment the one that do arise from thoughts about public or private usefulness what the two have in common be that they both arise from social sympathy or fellowfeeling with human happiness or misery and the way this keep turn up in all the part of my theory can fairly be regard as a confirmation of it qualities immediately agreeable to others it be the natureindeed the definitionof virtue that it be a quality of the mind agreeable to or approve of by everyone who consider or contemplate it but some qualities produce pleasure because they be useful to society or useful or agreeable to the person himself others produce it more immediately and it be to these others that i now turn companionable vir tues here be two parallel developments in society at large the mutual shock and oppositions of interest and selflove have constrain mankind to establish the laws of justice so as to preserve the advantage of mutual assistance and protection in smaller private gather the contrarieties of mens pride and selfconceit have introduce the rule of good manners so as to help the exchange of ideas and keep conversation go among wellbred people mutual deference be affect contempt of others be disguise authority be conceal attention be give to each in his turn and an easy conversation be maintain without speak heatedly or interruption or eagerness for victory and without any air of superiority such conduct be immediately agreeable to others independently of any thoughts of utility or beneficial tendencies they draw affection promote esteem and enhance the merit of the behaver many of the form of breed be arbitrary and casual but what they express be always the same a spaniard go out of his own house before his guest to signify that he leave the guest in charge in other countries the owner of the house walk out last as a common mark of deference and respect but a man wont be perfectly good company unless he have wit and ingenuity as well as good manners it may be hard to define wit but its surely easy enough to learn that wit be a quality immediately agreeable to others and that on its first appearance it communicate a lively joy and satisfaction to everyone who have any comprehension of it in hum day wit cover more than it do for us today for something to qualify as an example of wit in his sense it need to be clever imaginative in some way precise it doesnt have to be funny the most profound metaphysics might be employ in explain the various kinds of wit and many of its species that we now class as wit on the sole testimony of taste and sentiment simply because thats what they feel like might turn out to be special case of something more general but all i need for present purpose be that wit do affect taste and sentiment and that because it give immediate enjoyment it be a sure source of approval and affection in countries where men pass most of their time in conversation and visit and assemblies these companionable qualities be highly value and constitute a large part of personal merit in countries where men live a more domestic life and either be employ in business or pass the time in a narrower circle of acquaintance respect be pay mainly to more solid personal qualities i have often observe that the first question the french ask regard a stranger be be he wellmannered do he have wit in our own country the chief praise bestow be always that someone be a goodnatured sensible fellow in conversation the lively toandfro spirit of dialogue be agreeable even to those who dont want to take part which be why the teller of long stories and the pompous conversational lecturer be very little approve of but most men do want to take part in the conversation and take a very dim view of the loquacity that deprive them of a right that they be naturally so protective of on social occasion we often encounter liars who tell stories about marvel their usual intention be to please and entertain and really they be harmless but men be most delight with what they think be true so these liars be utterly mistake about the mean of please and incur universal blame we be less hostile to lie or fiction when it occur in humorous stories because in that context it really be agreeable and entertain and truth be not important endowments that seem immediately agreeable and have a merit distinct from their usefulness include eloquence intellectual excellence of all kinds and even good sense and sound reason when they occur in a high degree and be employ on subject that be worthy and suitably challenge and these noble talents of the human mind get additional value from their rarity because rarity greatly increase the price of everything value oneself modesty can be understand in different sense even if we set aside chastity which i have already discuss hume identify and set aside four things that he say can be call modestyperhaps they could then but not now then but its most usual mean be in contrast to impudence and arrogance and express diffidence about ones own judgment and due attention and respect for others especially in young men this quality be a sure sign of good sense and its also a certain mean for a young man to increase his endowments by keep him always want to improve himself and keep his ears open to instruction on how to do it and this kind of modesty have a further charm to every spectator it flatter the spectators vanity by present the appearance of a teachable pupil who listen attentively and respectfully to every word he utter men have in general a much greater tendency to overvalue than to undervalue themselves notwithstanding aristotles opinion this make us more hostile to someones overvalue himself and cause us to regard with a special indulgence any tendency towards modesty and diffidence about ones abilities because we dont think that anyones undervalue himself risk go to such an extreme that it constitute a vice analogously in countries where people tend towards obesity personal beauty be associate with a much greater degree of slenderness than it be in countries where the most usual defect be thinness be so often strike with examples of one kind of ugliness people think they can never keep at too great a distance from it and want always to lean to the opposite side similarly if the door be open to self praise and we follow montaignes maxim that one should not shrink from say i have sense i have learn i have courage or beauty or wit if one think it be true we all know that such a flood of insolence would break in on us that it would make society wholly intolerable that be why custom have establish it as a rule in public gather that men should not indulge themselves in selfpraise or indeed say anything much about themselves and it be only among intimate friends or very mature people that a man be allow to do himself justice nobody find fault with the prince of orange for his reply to someone who ask him who do you think be the first general of the age to which he reply the marquis of spinola be the second notice that the princes imply selfpraise be better imply than if he have directly and openly express it only a very superficial thinker would imagine that all instance of mutual deference be to be understand as be mean seriously and literally and that there be something admirable about be ignorant of ones own merit and accomplishments we look with favour on a small bias towards modesty even in the internal sentiment especially in young people and on a strong bias in the outward behaviour but this doesnt exclude a noble pride and spirit that may openly display itself in its full extent when one be be attack or oppress in any way the noble obstinacy of socrates as cicero call it have be highly celebrate down through the centuries and when join to the usual modesty of his behaviour it form a shin character iphicrates the athenian be accuse of betray the interest of his country ask his accuser would you have be guilty of that crime in those circumstances by no mean reply the other well then cry the hero can you imagine that iphicrates would be guilty in short a noble spiritedness and selfvalue be a great excellence when it be well found be decently disguise be courageously support under distress and calumny and seem to derive its merit from the noble elevation of its sentiment or its immediate agreeableness to its possessor in a footnote hume cite aristotles nichomachean ethics he be presumably think of the description in a of unduly humble men their fault be worse than that of unduly proud men aristotle say and be commoner in people with ordinary character we approve of a bias towards modesty which be a quality immediately agreeable to others so we have two virtues a noble sense of ones own value and modesty when be excessive the resultant viceinsolence or haughtinessis immediately disagreeable to others when be excessive the resultant vice be immediately disagreeable to the person himself thats how we settle the boundaries of these duties a desire for fame reputation or stand in society be so far from be blameable that it seem inseparable from virtue intellectual power and creativeness and a noble disposition society expect and demand that we attend even to trivial matter in order to please others so its no surprise to find a man in company dress more elegantly and converse more pleasantly than when he be at home with his own family well then what be vanity which be rightly regard as a fault or imperfection a man vanity seem to consist chiefly in immoderately display his advantage honour and accomplishments and openly and pushily demand praise and admiration to such an extent that he offend others and encroach too far on their vanity and ambition which they have keep secret its also a sure symptom of the lack of the true dignity and highmindedness that be such a great ornament in any character why that impatient desire for applause as if you werent rightly entitle to it and couldnt reasonably expect that you would always get it why so anxious to tell us about the great people you have be associate with the compliment that have be pay to you the honour and distinctions you have receive as if these be not matter of course that we could easily have imagine without your tell us about them clean and decent decency or act appropriately to ones age sex character and station in the world be one of the qualities that be immediately agreeable to others and therefore be praise and approve effeminate behaviour in a man a rough manner in a womanthese be ugly because they be unsuitable to each character and different from the qualities we expect in the sex its as if a tragedy be full of fine comic bits or a comedy be full of tragic scenes the disproportions hurt the eye and convey to the spectators a disagreeable sentiment that be the source of blame and disapproval cleanliness deserve a place among the virtues because our cleanliness naturally make us agreeable to others and be a considerable source of love and affection noone will deny that someones neglect to keep himself clean be a fault and what make this a fault ie a minor vicemust be the uneasy sensation it give to others so this seemingly trivial matter clearly reveal the origin of moral distinctions about which the learn have involve themselves in such mazes of perplexity and error i know not what in addition to all the agreeable qualities the origin of whose beauty we can to some extent explain and account for there be something elsesomething mysterious and inexplicable which convey an immediate satisfaction to the spectator although he have no idea of why there be a manner a grace an ease a genteelness an iknownotwhat that some men possess more of than others its very different from external beauty and comeliness yet it catch our affection almost as suddenly and powerfully as beauty do and though this manner be chiefly talk about in connection with sexual passion where the conceal magic be easily explain surely much of it carry weight in all our value of character and form a considerable part of personal merit so this class of accomplishments must be trust entirely to the blind but sure testimony of taste and sentiment ie must be handle entirely through our feel with no guidance from any theoretical considerations and it must be consider as a part of ethics leave by nature to baffle all the pride of philosophy and make her aware of how narrow her scope be and how meagre her possessions we approve of someone because of his wit politeness modesty decency or any agreeable quality that he possess even if we have never meet him and so have never derive any benefit from these accomplishments of his we do have an idea of the effect they must have on those who be acquaint with him that have an agreeable influence on our imagination and give us the sentiment of approval all our judgments concern people manners and character have this idea as one of their source conclusion you could reasonably find it surprise that at this late stage in history anyone should think it necessary to argue elaborately for the thesis that personal merit consist entirely in the possession of mental qualities that be useful or agreeable to the person himself or to other people you might have think that this principle must have occur even to the first rough and ready enquirers into morals and have be accept as selfevident without any argument or disputation whatever be valuable in any way so naturally class itself as either useful or agreeablein latin as utile or dulcethat its hard to think why we should ever seek further or consider the question as a matter of intricate research or inquiry and if a quality that someone have be useful or agreeable it must be useful or agreeable to or for someoneeither the person himself or other people out of this a complete delineation or description of merit seem to emerge as naturally as a shadow be cast by the sun or an image be reflect on water if the grind on which the shadow be cast be smooth and level if the watersurface from which the image be reflect be calm an accurate figure be immediately present naturally nobody have to work at it why have such a simple and obvious theory so long have escape the most elaborate examination it seem reasonable to suppose that its because systems and hypotheses have pervert our natural understand like wind ruffle the surface of the water and spoil the reflection anyway whatever have happen in philosophy in ordinary everyday life these principles be still implicitly maintain whenever we applaud or censure any human behaviour we never allude to anything elseie anything except facts about what be usefulagreeable to himothers if we observe men in every interaction of business or pleasure in every discourse and conversation we wont find them have any difficulty about this subject of the basis for praise and blameexcept in the philosophy departments think about how natural the follow conversation be first speaker you be very fortunate that you have give your daughter to cleanthes hes a man of honour and humanity everyone who have any deal with him be sure of fair and kind treatment qualities useful to others second speaker i congratulate you also on the promise expectations of this soninlaw his hard work study the laws and his quick mind and knowledge impressive in one so young both of men and of business promise that he be due for great honour and advancement qualities useful to the person himself third speaker you surprise me when you speak of how hard cleanthes work at his business when i meet him recently in a very cheerful group he be the very life and soul of our conversation i have never before encounter anyone with so much wit along with good manners so much gallantry without affectation so much nontrivial knowledge so genteelly deliver qualities immediately agreeable to others fourth speaker you would admire him still more if you know him better the cheerfulness that you might notice in him isnt something he switch on when he be in company it run through the whole tenor of his life and keep a perpetual serenity on his face and tranquillity in his soul he have meet with severe trials misfortunes and even dangers and his greatness of mind enable him to rise above them qualities immediately agreeable to the person himself then i join in the picture of cleanthes that you have just present be a picture of accomplish merit a philosopher might select this character as a model of perfect virtue in common life every quality that be useful or agreeable to ourselves or to others be regard as a part of personal merit and nothing else will be so regard as long as men be judge things by their natural unprejudiced reason without the delusive gloss of superstition and false religion celibacy fast penance mortification physically hurt oneself selfdenial humility silence solitude and the whole train of monkish virtueswhy be they everywhere reject by men of sense its because they serve no purpose of any kind they dont advance a man fortune in the world or make him a more valuable member of society they dont qualify him for the entertainment of others or make him better able to enjoy himself what we see be just the opposite they interfere with all those desirable end they stupefy the understand and harden the heart obscure the imagination and sour the temper so we be right to transfer them to the opposite column put them in the list of vices and no superstition have enough force among men of the world to pervert entirely these natural sentiments relate to what be usefulagreeable to oneselfothers a gloomy harebrained fanatic may after his death have a place in the calendar of saint but while he be alive hell scarcely ever be admit into intimacy and society except by those who be as delirious and dismal as he be it seem like a good feature of my theory that it doesnt get into the vulgar dispute about the degrees of benevolence or selflove that prevail in human nature ie the dispute that sprawl across the territory between those who hold that human be be very benevolent and not very selfish and those who hold that they be very selfish and not very benevolent that dispute isnt likely ever to be settle for two reason because men who have take part in it be not easily convince and because the phenomena that can be produce on either side be so scatter so uncertain and open to so many interpretations that its scarcely possible to command a clear view of them as a totality or draw from them any determinate inference or conclusion all i need for my present purpose be agreementand surely it would be the greatest absurdity not to agreethat there be in our makeup some benevolence however little some spark of friendship for human kind some particle of the dive work into our constitution along with the elements of the wolf and the serpent however weak these generous sentiments or feel be even if they dont have enough force to move a hand or a finger they must still direct the decisions of our mind and produceother things be equala cool preference for what be useful and serviceable to mankind as against what be harmful and dangerous this immediately give rise to a moral distinction a general sentiment of blame and approval a perhaps very faint preference for state of affairs of one kind and against ones of another kind as for the thinkers who so earnestly maintain that mankind be predominantly selfishthey wont be scandalize by hear of the weak sentiments of virtue implant in our nature on the contrary those philosophers be as ready to maintain the one tenet as the other and their wish to mock mankind for that not corruption seem to be what drive them naturally give rise to both opinions which be closely link and can hardly be separate one of the tenets be the thesis that human be be predominantly selfish what be the other a that human be in general have some sentiment of benevolence or b that human be in general have a very weak sentiment of benevolence all hume have lay a foundation for be a but the last two sentence of the paragraph require b he have move across by go from a however weak these generous sentiments be to b by hear of the weak sentiments of virtue implant in our nature avarice ambition vanity and all the passions that be commonly though wrongly classify as kinds of selflove be exclude from my theory concern the origin of morals not because they be too weak but because they arent in the right way directional let me explain the notion of morals imply some sentiment that all mankind have a sentiment that produce general approvalapproval by everyone or nearly everyonefor the very same object it also imply some sentiment that be aim at all mankind a sentiment that lead us to applaud or censure the action and conduct of people any people even ones who be far away accord to whether they do or dont conform to the rule of right that be establish the only thing in the human makeup that satisfy these two requirements be the sentiment of humanity that i be emphasize here everyone have it and we have it towards everyone the other passions produce in everyone many strong sentiments of desire and aversion affection and hatred but they cant be the basis for any general system and establish theory of blame or approval because they satisfy neither nor when a man refer to someone else as my enemy my rival my antagonist my adversary he be understand to be speak the language of selflove he be express sentiments that be specifically his and arise from his particular circumstances and situation but when he characterize someone as vicious or odious or deprave he be speak a different language and express sentiments that he expect to be share by all who hear him in this second case therefore he must depart from his private and particular situation and choose a point of view that be common to him and the others he must what hume write next move some universal principle of the human frame and touch a string to which all mankind have an accord and symphony what he mean set move some actiongenerator that be build into the human constitution and pluck a string that be tune to a note that will resonate with all mankind if what he mean to express be that this man have qualities whose tendency be harmful to society then he have do what be need for this to be proper moral speech that be he have choose a common point of view and have touch the principle of humanity that be find in some degree in everyone for as long as the human heart be make out of the same elements as at present it wont ever be wholly indifferent to public good or entirely unaffected by the likely consequences of character and manners this feel of humanity may not generally be credit with as much strength as vanity or ambition but because it be common to all men it be the only possible basis for morals ie of any general system of blame or praise your ambition be not mine and something that would satisfy yours wouldnt satisfy mine but your humanity be mine and be everyonesthe same things arouse this passion in all human creatures in this context humanity refer not to the property of be human but rather to the feel of benevolence towards all human be and the sentiments that arise from humanity be not only the same in all human creatures and produce in them the same approval or censure but they be also direct at all human creatures so that theres noone whose conduct or character isnt open to be censure or approve by everyone in contrast with that the passions that be standardly call selfish produce different sentiments in each individual accord to his particular situation and also contemplate most of mankind with the utmost indifference and unconcern whoever have a high regard and esteem for me flatter my vanity whoever express contempt embarrass and displease me but these feel connect me with only a small part of mankindthe majority of mankind cant be target of such feel because they dont even know my name but if you present me with an account of tyrannical insolent or barbarous behaviour in any country at any time that quickly carry my thoughts to the harmful consequences of such conduct and i feel the sentiment of repugnance and displeasure towards it noone can be so remote from me that his character and conduct be wholly indifferent to me i will always be draw to whatever be beneficial to society or to the person himself and every quality or action of every human be must in this way be put into some classgiven some labelthat express general censure or applause what more can we ask therefore to distinguish the sentiments that depend on humanity from the ones connect with any other passion or to explain to us why the former and not the latter be the origin of morals whatever conduct get my approval by touch my humanity procure also the applause of all mankind by affect the same principle in them whereas what serve my greed or ambition please these passions in me alone and have no effect on the avarice and ambition of the rest of mankind there be no conduct in any man provide it have a beneficial tendency that isnt agreeable to my humanity however remote from me the man be but if a man be remote enough from me not to thwart or help my greed and ambition those passions of mine pay no attention to him when we have such a large and obvious distinction between two kinds of sentiment language be bind to follow its contour and to invent a set of term specifically to express sentiments of one of the two kindsspecifically the universal sentiments of censure or approval that arise from humanity ie from view of general usefulness and its opposite and so virtue and vice become know morals be recognize certain general ideas of human conduct be form on these ideas we base rule of conduct that men be expect to measure up to we judge that this action conform to our abstract rule while that one doesnt and the particular sentiments of selflove be often control and limit by such universal principles or rule from instance of popular tumults seditions factions panic and all passions that be share with a multitude we can learn the influence of society in arouse and support any emotion and from the same source we can also learn that the most ungovernable disorder grow from the slightest and most frivolous cause the athenian ruler solon deal harshly with people who didnt take side in a civil war but i dont think many people would get into trouble in that way if their feel and ways of talk be allow to count in their favour in a civil war no selfishness and hardly any philosophy have sufficient force to keep one entirely cool and indifferent someone who in that situation didnt catch fire from the common blaze would have to be more than a manor less than a man so its no wonder that moral sentiments be find to have such influence in life although they come from source that may at first sight appear somewhat small and delicate but remember that these principles be social and universal they form in a manner the party of mankind against vice or disorder mankinds common enemy and because the benevolent concern for others be spread in a greater or lesser degree through all men and be the same in all it crop up more often in discourse be cherish by society and conversation and that have the effect that the blame and approval that depend on it be rouse from the lethargy into which they be probably lull in solitary and uncultivated nature hume be refer to a theoretical state of nature in which men be solitary and primitive he isnt necessarily assume that there be or ever be such a it seem certain both from reason and from experience that a rough unteach savage regulate his love and hatred chiefly by the ideas of benefit to him and harm to him and have only a faint conception of a general rule or system of behaviour his attitude to the man who stand against him in battle the enemy for short be this he hat the enemy heartily not only for the present moment which be almost unavoidable but for ever after and he wont settle for anything less than extreme punishment and vengeance for the enemy now consider how we accustom to society and to take broader view regard someone the enemy again who oppose us in battle we bear in mind that the enemy be serve his own country and community that any man in the same situation would do the same and that include us and that it be best for human society in general if men do conform to such maxims as that a man should fight for his country when call upon and with the help of these suppositions and view we somewhat correct our rougher and narrower position which be like those of the savage and though much of our friendship and enmity be still govern by private considerations of benefit and harm we at least pay a certain homage to the general rule that we be accustom to respect i mean the homage of pervert our adversarys conduct by impute malice or injustice to him so as to give vent to passions arise from selflove and private interest when the heart be full of rage it be never short of pretences of this nature state other passions be selfish and private and that have the result that the social and public benevolent concern often overpower them and take command of our emotional state even when the other passions be stronger at their outset another spring of our constitution that add a lot of force to moral sentiments be the love of fame which rule with such uncontrolled authority in all generous mind and be often the grand object of all their design and undertake a person with a generous mind in the sense in which hume mean that word be someone whose aim and aspirations have scope and grandeur whose thoughts be broad and deep and sweep whose ambition be not hem in by caution we dont have any one word that capture it some use of the word earlier in this work may also carry that mean though they could all be understand in the sense that generous have today by our continual and earnest pursuit of a character a name a reputation in the world we frequently review our own conduct and consider how it appear in the eye of people who come in contact with us this constant habit of survey our own reflection so to speak keep alive all the sentiments of right and wrong and create in people with noble natures a certain reverence not only for others but for themselvesand this be the surest guardian of every virtue the animal conveniences and pleasures sink gradually in their value while every inward beauty and moral grace be carefully acquire and the mind come to be equip with every perfection that can adorn or embellish a rational creature here be the most perfect morality we know here be display the force of many sympathies our moral sentiment be itself a feel chiefly of that nature those be hum exact eleven word and our concern for be in good stand with other people seem to arise only from our concern for be in good stand with ourselves want to be on good term with ourselves we find that our shaky judgment have to be prop up by the correspond approval of mankind suppose for purpose of argument that all these reason of mine be false i shall now adopt the follow stance i be simply wrong when i say that the sentiments of humanity and sympathy be the source of our pleasure in thoughts or prospect of utility i have to find some other explanation of our applause for thingswhether inanimate animate or rational that have a tendency to promote the welfare and advantage of mankind it sound absurd to suppose that an object be approve of because of its tendency produce a certain end while the end itself be a matter of total indifference but let us swallow this absurdity in order to see where it take us the description or definition that i have give of personal merit be still evidently true and authoritative it must still be concede that every quality of the mind that be useful or agreeable to the person himself or to others communicate pleasure to the spectator command his esteem and be accept under the honourable label virtue and merit why be justice fidelity honour truthfulness faithfulness and chastity hold in such high esteem isnt it because of their tendency to promote the good of society isnt that tendency inseparable from humanity benevolence gentleness generosity gratitude moderation tenderness friendship and all the other social virtues can it possibly be doubt that industry discretion frugality order perseverance forethought judgment and this whole class of virtues and accomplishments that it would take many page to listcan it be doubt i repeat that the tendency of these qualities to promote the interest and happiness of the person who have them be the whole basis for their merit compare a mind that support a perpetual serenity and cheerfulness a noble dignity and undaunted spirit a tender affection and goodwill to everyone within reach with a mind that be deject with melancholy torment with anxiety irritate with rage or sink into the most abject baseness and degeneracy who can dispute that the former have more enjoyment within itself and be also a more animate and joygiving spectacle to others as for the qualities that be immediately agreeable to others they speak sufficiently for themselves and if you have never perceive the charm of a humorous wit or flow affability of a delicate modesty or decent genteelness of speech and manner you must be very unfortunate either in the temperament you have or in the company you keep im aware that nothing can be more unphilosophical than to be positive or dogmatic on any subject and that even excessive scepticism suppose it could be maintain wouldnt be more destructive of all sound reason and inquiry than dogmatism be im convince that where men be the most sure and arrogant be generally where they be the most mistake its because they have give passion a free rein without the proper deliberation and suspension of judgment that be their only protection against the grossest absurdities but i must confess that my fouritem list put the matter in so strong a light that i cant at present be more assure of any truth that i have learn from reason and argument than i be that personal merit consist entirely in the usefulness or agreeableness of qualities to the person who have them or to other people who interact with him but i remind myself that although the size and shape of the earth have be measure and describe the motion of the tide have be explain the order and system of the heavenly body have be bring under their proper laws and infinity itself have be reduce to calculation men be still argue about the foundation of their moral duties when i think about that i fall back from dogmatism into diffidence and scepticism and suspect that any hypothesis as obvious as mine would if it be true have receive long ago the unanimous vote of mankind have explain the moral approval that come with merit or virtue my only remain task be briefly to consider how if at all our interest create an obligation to conform to morality the question be this for any man who have any concern for his own happiness and welfare the best course of action be for him to perform every moral duty true or false if the answer true can be clearly derive from my theory ill have the satisfaction of know that i have advance principles that dont just i hope stand the test of reason and inquiry but also may contribute to the amendment of mens live and their improvement in morality and social virtue let me reflect for a moment on the relation between true and salutary the philosophical truth of a proposition never depend on its tendency to promote the interest of society but a proposition that have the opposite tendency though it may be true perhaps ought not to be make public only a very nasty man would publicly deliver a theoryeven a perfectly true onethat he have to admit will lead to conduct that be dangerous and harmful why explore the corner of nature that spread nastiness all around why dig up the diseasecarrying stuff from the pit in which it be bury the skill of your research may be admire but your system will be detest and mankind will agree that if they cant refute it they can at least bury it in eternal silence and oblivion and theycan do that because truths that be harmful to society if there be any will be overcome by falsehoods that be salutary and helpful but no philosophical truths could be more advantageous to society than the ones i have present here they represent virtue in all her genuine and most engage charm and make us approach her with ease familiarity and affection she lose the dismal dress that she have be cover with by many theologians and some philosophers so that all we see be virtue in all her gentleness humanity beneficence and kindly politenesseven sometimes her play frolic and gaiety she doesnt talk to us of useless austerities and rigours suffer and selfdenial she declare that her sole purpose be to make her devote and all mankind cheerful and happy during every instant of their existence if possible and she never willingly part with any pleasure except to get ample compensation at some other period in the persons life the only trouble that she require us to take be that of accurate calculation which we sometimes need if we be to maintain a steady preference for the greater happiness and if she be approach by wouldbe moralists who be enemies to joy and pleasure she either reject them as hypocrites and deceivers or if she admit them to her circle she rank them among the least favour of her devote enough of metaphors what hop can we ever have of draw mankind into a way of life that we admit to be full of austerity and rigour what theory of morals can ever serve any useful purpose unless it can show in detail that all the duties that it recommend be also the true interest of each individual the unique advantage of my system seem to be that it furnish a proper basis for that result theres presumably no need to argue that the virtues that be immediately useful or agreeable to the person who have them be desirable from the point of view of selfinterest moralists can spare themselves all the trouble they often take in recommend these duties whats the point of collect arguments to show that temperance be advantageous and that the excesses of pleasure be harmful when its obvious that these excesses be only call excesses because they be hurtful and that if the unlimited use of rum for example do no more harm to ones health or the faculties of ones mind and body than the use of air or water it wouldnt be a whit more vicious or blameable there also seem to be no need to argue that the companionable virtues of good manners and wit decency and genteelness be more desirable than the contrary qualities our vanity alone without any other consideration be a sufficient motive to make us want to have these accomplishments no man be ever willingly lack in them all our failures here proceed from bad upbringing lack of abilities or a perverse and rigid disposition do i want my company to be want admire follow rather than hat despise avoid can anyone seriously deliberate about this just as no enjoyment be sincere without some reference to company and society so no society can be agreeableor even tolerablewhen a man feel that his presence in it be unwelcome and discover all around him symptoms of disgust and aversion but why shouldnt all this hold just as well for the greater society or gettogether of mankind as well as for particular club and gather i have be argue for this the limit endowments of ingenuity and politeness be desirable from the point of view of happiness and selfinterest why if we be sure of that would we doubt this the enlarge virtues of humanity generosity and beneficence be desirable from the point of view of happiness and selfinterest be we afraid that those social affections will interfere with private utility to a greater extent and in a more immediate way than any other pursuits so that they cant be gratify without some important sacrifice of honour and advantage if so we arent well inform about the nature of the human passions and be more influence by verbal distinctions than by real differences whatever contradiction may be commonly think to exist between selfish sentiments or dispositions and social ones theres really no more conflict between those two than there be between selfish and ambitious selfish and revengeful selfish and vain what hume write next it be requisite that there be an original propensity of some kind in order to be a basis to selflove by give a relish to the object of its pursuit and none more fit for this purpose than benevolence or humanity what he seem to have mean a persons selflove or selfishness be active only when he selfishly pursue his goals but he cant have any such goals unless he haslying deeper within him than his selflovesome sort of lean or like or preference for somethingorother and the best candidate for that role be benevolence or humanity ie a lean or like for the welfare of mankind the goods that the world bring us be spend in one gratification or another the miser who accumulate his annual income and lend it out at interest have really spend it in the gratification of his greed and it would be hard to show why a man lose more by a generous action than by any other method of expense since the most he can achieve by the most elaborate selfishness be the gratification of some like suppose that you have full power to model your own disposition now deliberate about what appetite or desire you would choose to be the basis for your happiness and enjoyment the lean or like refer to above youll want to have some appetite or desire a life without passion would be altogether insipid and tiresome youll have notice that every like when gratify by success give a satisfaction proportional to the force and violence of the like thats an advantage that every like have so it doesnt favour benevolence over any of its rival but it have other advantage that do select it out of the herd the immediate feel of benevolence and friendship humanity and kindness be sweet smooth tender and agreeable come what may these virtues be also accompany by a please awareness or memory while we retain the pleasant think of have do our part for mankind and society that keep us on good term with ourselves as well as with others if we devote ourselves to try to satisfy our greed and ambition we may have successes that all men will resent but we can be almost sure of their goodwill and good wish so long as we persevere in the paths of virtue and devote ourselves to generous plan and purpose what other passion be there that bring together so many advantagesan agreeable sentiment a please consciousness a good reputation but men be pretty much convince of these truths without help from me and when they be deficient in their duty not want to be generous friendly and humane its because they dont feel that they be generous friendly or humane treat vice with the utmost fairness and make all possible concessions to it we must acknowledge that there be never the slightest pretextfrom the point of view of selfinterestfor prefer it to virtue except perhaps in the case of justice where a man may often seem to be a loser by his integrity it be agree that no society could survive without a respect for property but because of the imperfect way in which human affairs be conduct it could happen in a particular case that a sensible knave think that a dishonest or treacherous act will make a considerable addition to his fortune without greatly weaken the bond that hold society together the phrase sensible knave be a kind of technical term in the write of hume and of many who have come after him it refer to a bad man who give some think to what he be do the thesis that honesty be the best policymeaning best from the selfinterested point of viewis a good general rule but there be many exceptions to it and it might be think that the wisest person be the one who obey the general rule except for take advantage of all the exceptions i must confess that if someone think that this line of think need an answer it wont be easy to find one that will convince him if his heart doesnt rebel against such harmful maxims if he doesnt shrink from the think of villainy or baseness he have indeed lose a considerable motive to virtue and we may expect that his behaviour will fit in with his doctrine that he should be honest except where it be better for him to be dishonest but in all openly honest natures the dislike for treachery and roguery be too strong to be counterbalance by any view of personal profit or monetary advantage inward peace of mind consciousness of integrity a satisfactory review of our own conductthese be all very much require for happiness and will be cherish and cultivate by every honest man who feel the importance of them such a person will also have the frequent satisfaction of see knaves with all their suppose cunning and abilities betray by their own maxims a knave who intend only to cheat with moderation and secrecy will come across a tempt opportunity to go further nature be frail and hell fall into the snare from which he can never extricate himself without a total loss of reputation and the forfeiture of all future trust and confidence with mankind but even if a knave be ever so secret and successful an honest man if he have the slightest touch of philosophy or even just common observation and reflection will discover that the knave be in the last analysis the greatest dupe have sacrifice the priceless enjoyment of a good characterat least in his own eyesin return for the acquisition of worthless toy and trinkets so little be need to supply the necessities of nature and from the point of view of pleasure there be no comparison between the feverish empty amusements of luxury and big spend and the unbought satisfaction of conversation society study even health and the common beauties of nature but above all the peaceful reflection on ones own conduct these natural pleasures indeed be really pricelessit cost nothing to get them and the enjoyment of them be above all price appendix moral sentiment or feel if my theory be accept that will make it easy for us to answer the question with which i beganthe one about whether our morality arise from reason or from sentiment or feel or from both i postpone answer that question because i think it might involve us in intricate speculations that be unfit for moral discourse but now i come back to it and examine how far either reason or sentiment enter into all decisions of praise or censure one principal basis for moral praise lie in the usefulness of the quality or action be praise so obviously reason must play a considerable part in all decisions of this kind why because only reason can instruct us about the tendency causal properties of qualities and action and point out their beneficial consequences to society and to the person who have them or do them there be often a great deal of controversy about this doubt may arise conflict interest may come into it and one of the options have to be choose on the basis of fine detail and a small difference in utility this be especially noticeable with question about justicewhich be what its natural to expect give the kind of utility that this virtue involve more about that in appendix if every individual instance of justice be useful to society in the way that every individual instance of benevolence be this would simplify things and not involve much controversy but that be not how things stand it often happen that a single instance of justice be harmful in its first and immediate consequences and bring advantage to society only through the observance of the general rule of which it be an instance so that the advantage require that many people will act in accordance with that rule which mean that the casethe weigh up of pros and consbecomes more intricate and involve the many detail about how society work consequences of any general practice and interest that may come into it these be often doubtful and subject to great discussion and inquiry the object of civil laws be to settle all the question about justice the debate among laypeople the thoughts of politicians the precedents of history and public record be all direct to the same purpose and in many case a very precise reason or judgment be need for the right solution to be find when there be such intricate doubt arise from obscure or opposite utilities but although reasonwhen its in good shape and properly usedis all we need for learn about the harmful or useful tendency of qualities and action its not enough on its own to produce any moral blame or approval utility be only a tendency to produce a certain end if that end be totally indifferent to us we would feel the same indifference towards the mean to get a preference for the useful as against the harmful tendencies some kind of sentiment have to be at work the sentiment in question cant be anything but a feel for the happiness of mankind and a resentment of their misery since happiness and misery be the different end that virtue and vice have a tendency to promote in these contexts then reason instruct us in the various tendencies of action and humanity make a distinction in favour of the ones that be useful and beneficial this partition between the faculties of understand and of sentiment in all moral decisions seem clear from the theory about the origin of morals that i have be defend in this work but let us suppose that my theory be false and start look for some other satisfactory theory and im will to risk the claim that we wont find one as long as we suppose reason to be the sole source of morals in support of this consider the five follow point a false hypothesis can easily maintain some appearance of truth as long as it be state only in general term use undefined term and employ comparisons instead of instance this be conspicuously the case with the philosophy that regard reason as the sole source of moral distinctions with no input from sentiment however plausible this theory may be in general declamations and discourse when it be apply to any particular instance it cant even be render intelligible let alone be show to be true examine the crime of ingratitude for instance in this context hume be use crime for any episode of morally wrong conduct or think or feel it have no special link with the criminal law of the state this occur whenever we observe on one side goodwill express and know together with help give and on the other illwill or indifference and harm do or at least no help give anatomize all these factsanalyse them as finely as you likeand try through your reason alone to discover what there be thats bad or blameworthy about this conduct youll never come to any issue or conclusion reason make judgments concern matter of fact and relations let start by ask in a case of ingratitude where be the matter of fact that we be call a crime point it out determine the time when it occur describe its essence or nature explain the sense or faculty to which it be reveal the ingratitude reside in the mind of the person who be ungrateful so he must feel it be conscious of it but theres nothing there except the frame of mind of illwill or absolute indifference you cant say that these all by themselves always and in all circumstances be crimes no they be crimes only when we direct them towards people who have previously express and display goodwill towards us so we can infer that the crime of ingratitude be not any particular individual fact it arise from a complex of circumstances which when observe by a spectator arouse in him the sentiment of blamethis be something that happen because of the particular structure and texture of his mind you may say what you have just say be false somethings be a crime doesnt indeed consist in a particular fact that we be assure of by reason but it do consist in certain moral relations that reason discover just as we discover by reason the truths of geometry or algebra but what relations be you talk about in the case describe i see first goodwill and help in one person then illwill and harm in the other between these there be a relation of contrariety do the crime consist in that relation but suppose a person bore me illwill or do me harm and i in return be indifferent towards him or give him help here be the same relation of contrariety and yet my conduct be often highly praiseworthy twist and turn this matter as much as you will you can never base morality on relations you have to bring in the decisions of sentiment when someone say that two and three be equal to half of ten i understand this relation of equality perfectly i have the think that if ten be divide into two part of which one have as many units as the other and if either of these part be compare with two add to three it will contain as many units as that compound number but when you invite me to compare this with moral relations i admit that im altogether at a loss to understand you a moral actiona crime such as ingratitudeis a complex object do the morality consist in the relation of its part to each other how in what way specify the relationbe more particular and explicit in your propositionsand youll easily see their falsehood you reply no the morality consist in the relation of action to the rule of right and they be label good or bad accord to whether they do or dont conform to that rule in that case what be this rule of right what do it consist in how do we discover it by reason you say which examine the moral relations of action so moral relations be determine by relate action to a rule and that rule be determine by consider the moral relations of object isnt this fine reason all this be metaphysics you say that be enough to make it very likely that what you say be false i reply yes we be certainly involve in metaphysics but it all come from youfrom your advance an obscure hypothesis that can never be make intelligible or fit to any particular instance or example my hypothesis be plain it say that morality be determine by sentiment or feel it define virtue as whatever mental action or quality give to a spectator the please sentiment of approval and it define vice as whatever mental action or quality give to a spectator the unpleasing sentiment of disapproval i then proceed to examine a plain matter of fact namely what action have this influence i consider the feature share by all the action we call virtuous and the feature share by all that we call vicious or wrong and try to extract from some general truths about these sentiments of approval and disapproval if you call this metaphysics and find anything in it obscure you should conclude that you dont have the right sort of mind for the systematic study of human behaviour think about someone who be deliberate about whether in a particular emergency he should help his brother or his benefactorhe cant help both in order to settle where his duty lieswhich of the two he have a great obligation tohe must consider the relations brother of and benefactor of and all the facts about what his brother and his benefactor be like and how they be situate now compare that with this in order to determine the proportion of line in a triangle one must examine the nature of that triangle and the relation its different part have to each other the two procedures look similar but basically they be enormously different someone engage in theoretical reason about triangles or circle consider the various know and give interrelations of the part of these figure and from them he infer some previously unknown relation which follow from the know ones but to engage in moral deliberation we must be already be acquaint with all the relevant object and all their interrelations and from put all this together we fix our choice of what to do or our approval of what someone have do for example to deliberate about whether to help my brother or my benefactor i must know the facts about each and about all the relevant relations i have to each theres no new fact to be ascertain no new relation to be discover all the detail of the case be suppose to be lay before us before we assign blame or approval if any relevant fact about the situation be still unknown or doubtful we must first use our intellectual faculties to get it settle suspend all moral decision or sentiment hum exact fiveword phrase until that have be do be x an aggressor against y until we get that settle how can we determine whether ys kill of x be criminal or innocent but when every detail fact and every relation be know theres nothing leave for the understand to do no question for it to work on the approval or blame that ensue cant be the intellectual work of the faculty of judgment but the work of the heart its not a speculative theoretical proposition or assertion but an active feel or sentiment in the activities of the understand we infer something new and previously unknown from facts and relations that be know in moral decisions all the facts and relations must be know already and the mind go from its contemplation of all of this to feel some new impression of affection or disgust admiration or contempt approval or blame hence the great difference between a mistake about what action be right and a mistake about what the facts be and hence also the reason why the former kind of mistake be commonly criminal and the latter be not when oedipus kill laius he didnt know that laius be his father facts about the situation that werent his fault lead to his have false beliefs about the action he perform but when nero kill his mother agrippina all the relations between himself and her and all the factual detail be already know to him but in his savage heart the motive of revenge or fear or selfinterest prevail over the sentiments of duty and humanity and when we express our detestation of him its not because we see any relations that he didnt see rather our upright frame of mind cause us to feel sentiments against which he have become harden by flattery and a long history of enormous crimes so all moral determinations consist in these sentiments and not in a discovery of relations of any kind before we can form any decision of this kind all the facts about the action and its circumstances must already be know and then all we have to do be to feel some sentiment of blame or approval on the basis of which we pronounce the action criminal or virtuous the truth of my theory will become still more evident if we compare moral beauty with natural beauty which so closely resemble it in many respect all natural beauty depend on the proportion relations and position of part but it would be absurd to infer from this that the perception of beauty like that of truth in geometrical problems consist wholly in the perception of relations and be perform entirely by the understand or intellectual faculties in all the sciences our mind investigate unknown relations of things on the basis of relations that be know but in all decisions of taste or external beauty all the relations be already obvious to the eye and we move from them to feel a sentiment of satisfaction or disgust depend on what the object in question be like and on the state of our senseorgans euclid have fully explain all the qualities of the circle but none of his theorems say a word about its beauty the reason be clear beauty be not a quality of the circleit be nowhere to be find in any part of the line whose part be equidistant from a common centre a circle beauty be only the effect that it produce in the mind which be build in such a way as to be liable to have such sentiments youd be waste your time if you look for beauty in the circle try through your sense or through mathematical reason to detect it in the properties of that figure attend to the architects palladio and perrault when they explain all the part and proportion of a pillar they talk of the cornice and frieze and base and entablature etc and describe and locate each of these part of the pillar but if you ask them to describe and locate the pillars beauty they would immediately reply that the beauty isnt in any of the pillars part but result from the whole thing when that complex figure be present to an intelligent mind that be liable to have those finer sensations hum word until such a spectator turn up there be nothing but a figure of such and such dimension and proportion its from the spectators sentimentsand only from themthat the elegance and beauty of the pillar arise now attend to the orator cicero when he depict the crimes of the corrupt politician verres or the seditious conspirator catiline you must admit that the moral baseness resultslike the beauty of the pillarfrom the contemplation of the whole when present to someone whose organs have a particular structure and formation the orator may paint rage insolence barbarity on one side and meekness suffer sorrow and innocence on the other but if you dont feel indignation or compassion arise in you from this complex of facts it wouldnt do you any good to ask the orator what be the crime or villainy that you be so vehemently attack when do it come into existence and who be its subject now a few months later that every disposition and think of all the people involve be totally alter or annihilate what have become of the crime the abstract hypothesis of moralsie the theory that moral conclusions be establish by reasoncant give a satisfactory answer to any of these question eventually we have to admit that the crime or immorality rather than be a particular fact or relation that can be investigate by the understand arise entirely from the sentiment of disapproval that we unavoidably feel when we learn about barbarity or treachery what make this feel unavoidable be the structure of human nature inanimate object can relate to each other in all the ways that moral agents can but they cant be the object of love or hatred and so they arent capable of merit or iniquity hume here use inanimate in one of its old sense to mean nonbreathing roughly nonanimal a young tree that overtop and destroy its parent stand in all the same relations as nero do when he murder his mother and if morality consist merely in relations the young tree would no doubt be equally criminal it seem clear that the ultimate end of human action cant in any single case be account for by reason and submit themselves entirely to the sentiments and affections of mankind without depend in any way on our intellectual faculties heres an example to help you grasp the idea of an ultimate end ask a man why do you take exercise and he will answer because i want to keep my health ask him why do you want health and he will readily reply because sickness be painful if you now push on and ask him why do you hate pain he cant possibly answer this be an ultimate end and be never regard as a special case of something more general he might give to the question why do you want health a different answer namely because i need it to do my job if you ask why do you care about that he will answer because i want to earn money if you demand why he will say that money be the instrument of pleasure and beyond this it would be absurd to ask for a reason there cant possibly be a progress ad infinitum with each desire be base on a reason that consist in a desire for something else something must be desirable on its own account because of its immediate fit with human sentiment and affection now virtue be an end it be desirable on its own account without fee or reward purely for the immediate satisfaction it give so there have to be some sentiment that it trigger some internal taste or feelingor whatever you want to call itthat distinguish moral good from moral evil embrace the one and reject the other so we can easily establish the domain and the role of reason and the domain and role of taste or feel the former provide knowledge of truth and falsehood the latter yield the sentiment of beauty and ugliness vice and virtue reason discover object as they really be in nature not add or take away anything whereas feel or taste produce something add something it gild or paint natural object with colour borrow from internal sentiment and so it in a way create something new reason be cool and disengage so it isnt a motive to action its only link with action be that it direct the impulse it receive from appetite or inclination show us the mean to attain happiness or avoid misery taste or feel far from be cool give pleasure or pain so it constitute happiness or misery and therefore act as a motive to action it be indeed the first spring or impulsethe initial starterfor desire and volition from factual detail and relations that be know or suppose reason lead us to the discovery of truths that be conceal and unknown after all the factual detail and relations be lay before us taste or feel make us feel a new sentiment of blame or approval the standard of reason be found on the nature of things be eternal and inflexiblenot even the will of the supreme be can alter it the standard of taste or feel presumably could be alter by god if he choose to alter it it arise from the eternal makeup and constitution of animals so it be ultimately derive from the supreme will that give each species of animal its special nature and arrange the various class and order of existence appendix selflove theres a principle say to be accept by many people that be utterly incompatible with all virtue or moral sentiment it cant come from anything but the most deprave disposition in the person who maintain it and in its turn it tend still further to encourage that depravity the principle be this all benevolence be mere hypocrisy friendship a cheat public spirit a farce fidelity a snare to procure trust and confidence basically all of us pursue only our private interest but we wear these fair disguise so as to put others off their guard and make them even more vulnerable to our trick and scheme its easy to imagine what kind of heart a man must have if he believe this and feel no internal sentiment that contradict this harmful theory and to imagine his level of affection and benevolence towards a species that he paint in such revolt colour and suppose to be so unlikely to return the affection or be grateful for any good that be do for them or if someones acceptance of this principle doesnt come entirely from a corrupt heart he must have be lead by the most careless and rush examination of the human scene it could happen like this a superficial reasoner observe many false pretences among mankind he doesnt feel within himself any strong resistance to his act in such a way so he rush to the general conclusion that the whole species be equally corrupt and that men unlike all other animalsindeed unlike all other thingscant be distinguish from one another as better or worse not even slightly better or worse because under their various disguise and appearances they be all from the evaluative point of view the same another somewhat similar principle have be much insist on by philosophers and have be the foundation of many a system it be this whatever affection one may feel or imagine one feel for others there arent and cant be any disinterested not self interest feel the most generous friendship however sincere be a version of selflove even when we appear to be deeply engage in scheme for the liberty and happiness of mankind all we be really seek though we may not be aware of this be our own gratification by a turn of imagination or a refinement of reflection or an enthusiasm of passion we seem to do things in the interest of others and imagine that we be free of all selfish considerations but basically the most generous patriot and the most niggardly miser the bravest hero and the feeblest coward be equally concern with their own happiness and welfare in everything that they do this look like a damagecausing opinion which might lead you to think that anyone who announce it as his opinion cant possibly feel the true sentiments of benevolence or have any regard for genuine virtue but that conclusion turn out to be false probity and honour be no strangers to epicurus and his followers atticus and horace seem to have have by nature and to have develop through reflection dispositions that be as generous and friendly as any those of disciples of the sterner school and among the moderns hobbes and locke maintain the selfish theory of morals yet live irreproachable live and hobbes be not in a position to have the defect of his philosophy make up for by the restraints of religion an epicurean or a hobbesian freely agree that there be such a thing as a friendship in the world without hypocrisy or disguise though he may attempt through a philosophical chemistry to analyse this passion into elements that belong to some other passion and to explain every affection as a case of selflove that be twist and mould by a particular turn of imagination into a variety of appearances people imaginations differ in ways that affect how the basic passion be redirect so that even accord to this selfish theory mens character can differ widelywith one man be virtuous and humane another vicious and meanly selfinterested i admire the man whose selflove be somehow so direct as to give him a concern for others and render him useful to society i hate or despise the one who have no regard for anything but his own gratifications and enjoyments its no use your suggest that these seemingly opposite character be basically the same their only difference come from a very inconsiderable turn of think each character appear to me to be in practice pretty stable even if it do rest on a minor fact about how the persons imagination work and i dont find in this context any more than i do in others that the natural sentiments arise from the general appearances of things be easily destroy by subtle reflections on the fine detail of the origins of these appearances doesnt the lively cheerful colour of someones face give me satisfaction and pleasure even if i learn from science that differences in complexion all arise from tiny differences of thickness in tiny part of the skin make differences in which colour of the spectrum be absorb and which be reflect so the question concern the universal or partial selfishness of man doesnt make as much real difference to morality and conduct as it be usually think to do still it be certainly of consequence in the theoretical study of human nature and be a proper object of curiosity and enquiry so it may be worthwhile to offer a few thoughts about it here the most obvious objection to the selfish hypothesis be this because it be contrary to common feel and our natural untutored thoughts and be therefore an extraordinary paradox it couldnt be establish without the highest stretch of philosophy without support from lengthy elaborate and difficult philosophical argument to the most casual observer there appear to be such dispositions as benevolence and generosity such affections as love friendship compassion and gratitude the cause effect object and operations of these sentiments be mark by common language and observation and be plainly distinguish from the cause etc of the selfish passions this be the obvious appearance of things and we should just accept it unless and until some hypothesis be discover that can penetrate deep enough into human nature to show that the former affections be nothing but special case of the latter noone have yet succeed in do that though many have triedapparently because of the love of simplicity that have be the source of much false reason in philosophy i shant here go into detail about that many able philosophers have show up the failures of these simplify theories the view that ill be take for grant be one that i think the slightest reflection will make obvious to every impartial enquirer in this paragraph philosophy and philosopher probably also cover science and scientists anyway the nature of the subject create the strongest presumption that no better system will ever be invent that will explain the benevolent feel as arise from the selfish ones and thus reduce all the various emotions of the human mind to a perfect simplicity the situation in this area of philosophy be quite different from the situation in physics many an hypothesis in natural science have appear false at first and then after more accurate scrutiny find to be solid and satisfactory this happen so often that a judicious and witty philosopher fontenelle have go so far as to say that if theres more than one way in which a phenomenon could be produce theres a general presumption that it be produce by the least obvious and familiar of them but the presumption always lie on the other side in all enquiries into the origin of our passions and of the internal operations of the human mind in that context the simplest and most obvious causal story about any give phenomenon be probably the true one when a philosopher in set out his system have to avail himself of some very intricate and refine reflections and to suppose them to be essential to the production of some passion or emotion beware in such a case we have reason to be alertly on our guard against a false theory our affections cant be affect by refine activities of benevolence naturally divide into two kindsgeneral and particular my general benevolence towards someone occur when im not his friend be not connect with him and be not one of his admirers but feel a general sympathy with him be sorry about his pain and rejoice with him over his pleasures my particular benevolence towards someone be base on my think that he be virtuous or on help that he have give me or on some special connection between us theres no deny that both these sentiments be real aspects of human nature the question of whether they be really subtle versions of selflove be interest to study rather than practically important in the course of this inquiry i shall often have occasion to refer to general benevolence or humanity or sympathy and my general experience lead me to assume without further argument that it be real reason or imagination what we always find be that a vigorous exertion of the faculties of reason or imagination bring affections feel to a halt this be bind to happen because of the narrow capacity of the human mind its true that quite often our predominant motive or intention be conceal from ourselves when its mix in with other motives which the mind from vanity or selfconceit want to think be more prevalent but such concealment of ones own motives from oneself have never happen because of the abstruseness and intricacy of the motive a man who have lose a friend and patron may be flatter himself when he think that all his grief arise from generous sentiments with no admixture of selfinterested considerations but when a man grieve for a valuable friend whose patron and protector he wasie when the benefit have be flow in the opposite directionhow can we think that his passionate tenderness arise from some metaphysical relation to a selfinterest that he doesnt actually have we may as well imagine that tiny wheel and spring like those of a watch be what make a load wagon move as account for the origin of passion from such abstruse reflections animals be find to be capable of kindness to their own species and to ours and theres no suspicion that this involve disguise or playact be we to account for all their sentiments too in term of refine versions of selfinterest and if we admit a disinterested benevolence in the lower species by what rule of analogy can we refuse it in the higher love between the sex generate a satisfaction and goodwill that be quite different from the gratification of an appetite in all sentient be tenderness towards their offspring be commonly able to outweigh the strongest motivesneglec of selflove and doesnt in any way arise from selflove consider this case a fond mother lose her health through the hard work of nurse her sick child the child die and the mother languish and die of grief remember that the childs death free her from the slavery of care for it around the clock what selfinterest could possibly be at work here isnt gratitude an affection of the human breast or be gratitude merely a word with no mean or reality dont we get more satisfaction from one man company than from anothers dont we want our friend to have a happy life even if absence or death prevent us from have any part in it and in most case even while we be alive and present what give us any part in our friends good fortune other than affection and respect for him these and a thousand other examples be sign of a general benevolence in human nature in situations where no real selfinterest bind us to the object and its hard to see how a real passion or emotion can arise from an interest that the person know and admit to be imaginary no satisfactory hypothesis of this kind have be discover so far and there isnt the least probability that one will be find however hard men work at it and theres another point if you think about it properly youll see that as between these two hypotheses there be disinterested benevolence distinct from selflove all friendship and humanity be a version of selflove the one that be really simpler be not but its true that postulate only one basic feel while postulate at least two but lead to a simpler overall theory than do because it fit better into the analogy of nature in the rest of this paragraph i shall present an important very general thesis and then fit type benevolence in with it everyone agree that there be bodily want or appetites that necessarily precede all sensual enjoyment and lead us immediately to try to get whatever it be that the appetite be an appetite for for example hunger and thirst have eat and drink as the end they aim for and from the gratification of these primary appetites arise a pleasure that may become the object of another sort of desire or inclination that be secondary and selfinterested hum point in that very condense sentence be this primary appetite i be very hungry which lead me to reach up to pick an apple off a tree this isnt selfinterested conduct because the hunger lead to the action immediately rather than through any such think as it will suit my purpose very well if i pick that apple but in general when i be hungry and then eat i get pleasure from this and so secondary desire at a time when im not hungry i want to ensure that i will always have enough to eat and this want and the action it lead to be selfinterested because they do involve a think about my own interest similarly there be mental passions as distinct from physical appetites by which we be drive immediately to seek particular objectivesfame power vengeancewithout any think about what be in our interest and when these objectives be attain a please enjoyment ensue as a consequence of our get what we want for us to reap any pleasure from get fame or to pursue fame from motives of selflove and desire for happiness nature must have give us a basic inclination to go after famebasic in the sense that it isnt a special case of some more general desire or inclination why be this so its an upshot of the way the human mind be structure if i have no vanity i get no pleasure from praise if i lack ambition power give me no enjoyment if im not angry the punishment of an adversary be totally indifferent to me see note on page in each of these case theres a passion that point immediately to the objective and make the achieve of it a part of our good or happiness and then there be other secondary passions that arise afterwards and lead us to pursue the same objective as a part of our happiness once it have be make to be such by our basic affections if there be no appetite of any kind in advance ofand more basic thanselflove there would be hardly anything for selflove to do because we would have felt few pain or pleasures and no intense ones and so there would be little misery or happiness for us to avoid or to pursue well its easy to see that the same thing may be the case with benevolence and friendship the follow individual case would be part of general story because of the basic way i be build i feel a desire for your happiness or good because of that affection of mine your good become my own good and then i pursue your good from the combine motives of benevolence and selfenjoyment the basic passions and propensity that resemble our primary physical appetites be further remove from selfinterest than i have so far indicate i have make the point that they dont come from selfinterest arent versions of it but now i add that sometimes they run against selfinterest we all know that someones desire for revenge may be so strong that he seek revenge while know that he be neglect every consideration of ease interest and safety like some vindictive animals he infuse his very soul into the wound he give his enemy hume here have a footnote quote in latin horace write about the bee that leave its sting in the body of its enemy and die as a consequence and seneca write about someones neglect his own welfare in his eagerness to harm an enemy what a malignant philosophy it would be that didnt allow to humanity and friendship the same privilege that be indisputably grant to the darker passions of enmity and resentment such a philosophy may be a good foundation for paradoxical wit and tease but its a very bad one for any serious argument or reason appendix further point about justice in this appendix i plan to give some further detail about the origin and nature of justice and to mark some differences between it and the other virtues the social virtues of humanity and benevolence exert their influence immediately by a direct tendency or instinct that be focus mainly on whatever it be that have arouse the feel in question they dont bring in any theory or system or any think about the consequences of the behaviour they lead toconsequences from other people go along with the behaviour imitate it take it as an example a parent rush to help his child sweep along by the natural sympathy that drive him and doesnt give him a space in which to reflect on how the rest of mankind feel or behave in similar circumstances see note on sympathy on page a generous man cheerfully take up an opportunity to do something for his friend because at that moment he feel himself to be govern by beneficent affections he isnt concern with whether anyone else in the universe ever be drive by such noble motives or ever will be influence by his behaviour now to act in similar ways in every such case the social passions of a person x aim at a single individual objective and pursue the safety or happiness of the love and admire personof that person and noone else all x want be just that with no think of further consequences and in a correspond way the good his beneficence do arouse the moral sentiment of approval in others without their think about further consequences of xs behaviour itself or of its be a model for how other members of society might act so far from the behaviours be valuable only because others might follow suit the truth be almost the opposite if the generous friend or disinterested patriot be the only person engage in beneficence of this sort that would enhance his value in our eye the rarity and novelty of his conduct would add to the things we praise him for the case be not the same with the social virtues of justice and fidelity they be highly usefulor indeed absolutely necessaryto the wellbeing of mankind but the benefit they bring be not a consequence of every individual single act rather it arise from the whole scheme or system accept by the whole society or anyway most of it general peace and order be products of justice or the general practice of not take things that belong to others but it often happen that a particular case of respect the particular right of one individual citizen be consider in itself harmful in its consequences in a case of that sort the result of the individual act be directly opposite to that of the whole system of action the individual act may be extremely harmful although the general system of which it be a part be enormously advantageous when a bad man inherit riches from a parent this can lead to mischiefthats an individual case where right of inheritance be harmful its benefit come only from the rule be generally obey and it be sufficient here morally acceptable overall if that benefit outweigh all the bad consequences in some particular case the happiness and prosperity of mankind that arise from the social virtue of benevolence and its varieties can be compare to a wall that be build by many hand each stone that be put in place help the wall to rise and its overall increase in size depend on the diligence and care of each workman the happiness that arise from the social virtue of justice and its varieties be comparable to the build of a stone arch where each individual stone would fall to the grind if leave to itself and the whole arch be support purely by the mutual assistance and combination of its part this splendid comparison of hum depend on know how a stone arch work for help with that go to httpwwwtechnologystudentcomstructarchhtm all the laws of nature that regulate property as well as all civil laws that do so be general they fix on certain essential circumstances of the case and ignore the character situations and interrelations of the people concern as well as any particular consequences that may result from apply these laws in any particular case that come up if a beneficent man have acquire all his possessions through a mistake and without have a good legal title to them these laws dont hesitate to make him pass the whole lot over to the man who be legally entitle to them even if he be a selfish miser who have already heap up immense store of superfluous riches the interest of society as a whole require that property should be regulate by inflexible general rule the rule that be adopt be the ones that best serve the end of public utility but its impossible for them to prevent all particular hardships or make beneficial consequences result from every individual application of a rule it be sufficient if the whole plan or scheme be necessary for the support of civil society and if the overall good greatly outweigh the bad aspects of particular case dont think it would have be easy to devise rule that didnt work badly in special case even the general laws of the universe though plan by gods infinite wisdom cant exclude all evil or inconvenience from some particular events some have maintain that justice arise from human conventions and depend on the voluntary choice consent or workingtogether of mankind if in this context convention mean what be usually mean namely a promise nothing could be more absurd than this thesis the keep of promise be itself a considerable part of justicesurely we arent bind to keep our word because we have give our word to keep it but if on the other hand convention be be use here to refer to a sense of common interest that each man feel in himself and notice in his fellowmen as well a sense that carry him and them into a general plan of action that have public utility as a consequence then i have to agree that justice do arise from human conventions in this sense give the obvious fact that the particular consequences of a particular act of justice may be harmful not only to some individuals but to the public in general it follow that anyone who aim always to act justly must have an eye to the whole plan or system and must expect his fellowhumans to act in the same way in the same circumstances if he take into account nothing but the consequences of each individual act of his own his benevolence and humanityas well as his selflovemight often have him behave in ways very different from what the strict rule of right and justice prescribe thus two men pull the oars of a boat by common convention for common interest without any promise or contract thus gold and silver be make the measure of exchange thus speech and word and language be fix by human convention and agreement when two or more people behave in a way that be advantageous to all of them if they all perform their part in it but lose all advantage if only one perform their conduct must arise from a convention in the second of the above sense theres no other possible source for it no other motive for any one of them to participate in that scheme of conduct this theory about the origin of property and thus the origin of justice be pretty much the same as one hint at and adopt by grotius in his laws of war and peace hume quote at some length from this latin work the passage doesnt add any philosophical content to what be already before us the word natural be take in so many sense and be so loose in its mean that it seem pointless to argue about whether justice be natural if these be natural to man selflove benevolence reason forethought then we can also describe justice order fidelity property society as natural too mens want and need lead them to combine and their understand and experience tell them that this combination wont work if each man govern himself by no rule and isnt affect by the think that this or that thing belong to someone else and from these passions and reflections take together as soon as we observe similar passions and reflections in other people the sentiment of justice inevitably come to have some place large or small in the makeup of every individual of the human species thats what have happen down through the centuries in as intelligent an animal as man anything that necessarily arise from the use of his intellectual faculties can fairly be regard as natural among all civilize nations there have be a constant attempt to separate the institution of property from every kind of bias and favouritism and to base legal decisions about property on general view and considerations that apply equally to every member of society there be at least two reason for this nothing could be more dangerous than for judge to be accustom to allow their decisions to reflecthowever slightlytheir own private friendship or enmity if men think that the only reason why they lose a legal case be the judge personal bias they would be apt to become extremely hostile to the whole legal system that be why in case where natural reason doesnt yield any fix view of public utility that could settle a controversy about property manmade laws be often create to do what natural reason doesnt do and to govern procedure of all court of law quite often manmade laws dont do the job either and then precedents be call for and an earlier decisioneven one for which there be no sufficient reasonis rightly treat as a sufficient reason for a new decision when direct laws and precedents fail imperfect and indirect reason be bring to the rescue and the case in dispute be bring under them by analogical reason and comparisons liken and correspondences which be often more fanciful than real it be pretty safe to say that general jurisprudence usually legal theory but here probably legal practice be unlike all the sciences in this respect and that in many of its more finegrained question there cant properly be say to be truth or falsehood on either side natural can be oppose to unusual to miraculous or to artificial in the first two of those sense justice and property be undoubtedly natural perhaps they cant strictly be call natural in the third senseie mean not artificialbecause justice and property do presuppose reason forethought and design which mean that they be really artificial if men hadnt live in society property would never have be know and neither justice nor injustice would have exist but society among human creatures would have be impossible without reason and forethought lower animals that unite into something like societies be guide by instinct which serve them in place of reason but all these dispute be merely verbal if one pleader bring the case under some earlier law or precedent by mean of a refine analogy or comparison his opponent wont be at a loss to find an analogy or comparison that go the opposite way and the judge choice between these be often base more on taste and imagination than on any solid argument the general objective of all court of law be public utility and this also require a stable rule in all controversies but when there be an impasse create by several equally plausible rule some very slight turn of think settle the decision in favour of one of the party star t of a very long footnote the origin of justice and property be societys absolute need for some steady and constant scheme under which individual people possess things it usually doesnt matter much what possessions be assign to this or that person and rule govern that though they be to be strictly adhere to be often base on very frivolous view and considerations here be five examples of relatively specialise propertyrules in the last two of which our imagination be at work in ways that could fairly be call frivolous if a number of independent people come together to form a society the most obvious rule for them to agree on as a basis for property would be that everyone be to have a right of possession in any property that he own or have the use of now a persons become in this way the legal owner of something x would be base on a real relation that already exist between himself and x for a similar reason someones have be the first to occupy or use something be treat as a basis for his have it as his property this differ from only in not be tie to the imagine situation in which the society and its laws be be devise so it still have s feature of be base on an antecedent real relation between the person and the property when a man put work in on something that previously didnt belong to anyoneeg cut down and shape a tree cultivate a field or the likethe alterations he produce cause one relation between him and the object and this naturally draw us into establish a second relation between them by rule that the object be his legal property there be also a publicutility reason for this rule namely that it encourage hard work those be two reason for rule that labour create property in the manner i have describe there may be a third perhaps private humanity towards the man join in with the other two reason and make us want to leave him in possession of something that he have acquire by his sweat and labour something that he have think and hop he could go on use private humanity certainly cant be the origin of justice because justice often go against it but when societys need have establish rule of property some rule may arise from private humanity and reluctance to bring hardship upon someone im much incline to think that the right of inheritance depend greatly on connections of the imagination and that the reason why property be transfer to a man after the death of his father say be the fairly frivolous think that the man relation to his father somehow give birth to a relation between him and the property its true that hard work be more encourage by the transference of ownership to children or near relatives but this have force only in develop societies whereas the right of inheritance be recognize even among the greatest barbarians acquisition of property by accession can only be explain in term of the relations and connections of the imaginations accession law artificial improvement or natural growth of a property shorter oed to explain this i need first to say something about the ownership of rivers the laws of most nations and the natural turn of our thoughts dictate that rivers be own by the owners of their bank except for such vast rivers as the rhine or the danube which seem too wide to come to be own through ownership of the neighbour field but even these big rivers be regard as belong to the nation through whose territory they run because we think of a nation as be big enough to match up to such rivers in our imagination civil laws say that the accession that be make to land border upon rivers follow the land ie be own by the owners of the land provide that the accession be make very gradually and imperceptibly by the rivers deposit of silt or the like this gradualness help the imagination to tie the new land to the old land when a considerable portion of land be suddenly wash away from one bank and sweep across to the other it become the property of the person who own the land on that other side after it have unite with his land and the tree and plant have spread their root into both his old land and this new bite after that and not before it be only after that unite by soil and root that our thoughtstrictly speak our imaginationsufficiently join them in short we must always distinguish the need for a system of permanent propertyrights from the rule that determine who own what the need be obvious strong and invincible the specific rule may depend on lighter and less serious view about public utility on the sentiment of private humanity and aversion to bring hardship on people on manmade laws on precedents analogies and very fine connections and turn of the imagination end of the very long footnote before leave this subject i should remark that after the laws of justice have be fix by considerations of general utility we pay a great deal of attention to the harm that come to individuals through any violation of those laws such individual harm play a large part in how strongly we blame an unjust action by the laws of society this coat or this horse be mine and ought to stay in my possession im rely on be able to go on enjoy it and when you take it from me you disappoint my expectations and doubly displease me and offend every bystander it be a public wrong because it violate the general rule of ownership and it be a private harm because in it an individual be injure the private consideration wouldnt have any place in this if the laws violate by the public wrong hadnt first be establish for without those laws the distinction between mine and thine wouldnt be know in society but unquestionably our concern for general good be intensify by our concern for particular good something that harm the community without harm any individual be often more lightly think of but when the greatest public wrong also involve a considerable private wrong its not surprise that the highest disapproval attend such wicked behaviour appendix some verbal dispute nothing be more usual than for philosophers to trespass on the territory of grammarians and engage in dispute about word while think they be handle controversies of the deepest importance and concern i be try to keep out of frivolous and endless arguments of that sort when i use the utmost caution in state the objective of my present enquiry and set out simply to collect a list of the mental qualities that be the object of love or esteem and form a part of personal merit and a catalogue of the qualities that be the object of censure or reproach and detract from the character of the person who have them add some thoughts about the origins of these sentiments of praise or blame i avoid the term virtue and vice on every occasion when there might be some difficulty about themdifficulty arise from the fact that some of the qualities on my first list be usually call talents rather than virtues and that some of the items on my second list be often call defect rather than vices you might expect me now before end this moral enquiry to draw sharp line between virtues and talents and between vices and defect and to explain the rationales and the origins of those line well i be not go to an exploration of those line would end up be a merely grammatical enquiry but i shall offer four reflections which will contain all that i intend to say on this subject i dont find that in english or any other modern language the boundaries be exactly fix between virtues and talents vices and defect or that a precise definition can be give of the one as distinguish from the other we might try this the only admirable qualities that count as virtues be ones that be voluntary but think about such qualities as courage equanimity patience selfcontrol which almost every language classify as virtues although they depend little if at all on our choice or we might try this its only the qualities that prompt us to act our part in society that be entitle to be call virtues those be indeed the most valuable qualities but they be commonly call the social virtues and that adjective presuppose that some virtues be not social a third try intellectual endowments dont count as virtues only moral endowments do because they be the only ones that lead to action but many of the qualities that be usually call intellectual virtueseg prudence penetration discernment discretionalso have a considerable influence on conduct or we might try this qualities of the heartmeaning ones the exercise of which be accompany by a feel or sentimentare the genuine virtues whereas qualities of the head be not but that wont do either because industry frugality temperance perseverance and many other praiseworthy power or habit be generally call virtues and the exercise of them doesnt involve any immediate sentiment in the person concern in the middle of this welter of suggestions and refutations it be fortunate that the question cant possibly be of any importance because it be purely verbal a moral and philosophical discourse neednt enter into all these whims of language which be so variable in different dialects and even in the same dialect at different time still ill offer a view about the matter it seem to me that although everyone agree that there be virtues of many different kinds what we chiefly have in mind when we call a man virtuous or a man of virtue be his social qualities which be indeed the most valuable all the same an honest goodnatured man wouldnt get that honourable label if he be notably lack in any of the nonsocial virtues such as courage temperance economy industry understand dignity of mind who would ever say except as a joke he be a man of great virtue but a complete blockhead its not surprise that languages arent very precise in mark off virtues from talents and vices from defect because how we feel about them be not very different the sentiment of conscious worth the selfsatisfaction that come from a review of ones own conduct and character arise from the endowments of courage and ability industry and ingenuity as well as from other mental excellences and on the other side who isnt deeply embarrass when he think back on his own folly and clumsiness of behaviour feel a secret sting whenever his memory bring back any past episode in which he behave with stupidity or bad manners time never erase the cruel ideas that a man have of his own foolish conduct or of hostility he have bring on himself through his own cowardice or impudence they still haunt his solitary hours damp his most aspire thoughts and show him even to himself in the most contemptible and odious colour imaginable what be we more anxious to conceal from others and not have expose by jeer and satire than such blunder infirmities and meannesses and what be we chiefly vain about isnt it our bravery or learn our wit or breed our eloquence or skill in speak our taste or abilities we display these with care if not with ostentation and we commonly show more ambition to excel in them than even in the social virtues themselves though the social virtues be really of much greater excellence goodnature and especially honesty be so indispensably require for society that although any violation of these duties hum word bring the greatest blame no special praise be give to common instance of them of the sort that seem essential for the support of human society that i think be why although men be often very free in praise the qualities of their heart they be shy about commend the endowments of their head because the virtues of the head be think to be more rare and extraordinary be experience as more usual object of pride and selfconceit so that when someone boast of have them we strongly suspect that pride and selfconceit be at work in him its hard to tell whether you hurt a man character more by call him a knave or by call him a coward or to tell whether a beastly glutton or drunkard be as odious and contemptible as a meanly selfish miser suppose i could choose my characterspecifically choose between have a friendly humane heart and extensive genius and courage and all the other virtues of demosthenes and philip combine for my own happiness and selfsatisfaction i would choose but for the worlds view of me i would choose expect to get much more general applause and admiration from that than from the figure that a man cut in life the reception he meet with in company the admiration he get from those who know himall these advantage depend as much on his good sense and judgment as on any other part of his character a man who have the best intentions in the world and be utterly remove from all injustice and violence still wont get much respect from the world unless he have at least a moderate share of intellectual competence so what be there here for us to dispute about if sense and courage temperance and industry wisdom and knowledge be agree to form a considerable part of personal merit if a man who have those qualities be better satisfy with himself and better entitle to the goodwill respect and cooperation of others than be anyone who entirely lack them if in short these endowments arouse similar sentiments to those arouse by the social virtues be there any reason for us to be so extremely scrupulous about a word or to argue about whether they be entitle to the label virtues it may be claim that the sentiment of approval produce by the accomplishments as well as be inferior to the sentiment that greet the virtues of justice and humanity be also somewhat different from it but this doesnt seem to be a sufficient reason for classify the two quite differently and give them different label within the class of characteristics that be uncontroversially class as virtues there be considerable differences in the sentiments that they produce in others the historian sallust describe the character of caesar and of cato in a way that qualify each to count as virtuous in the strictest and tightest sense of the word but their ways of be virtuous be different and the sentiments they arouse in us be also somewhat different caesar produce love cato produce admiration caesar be amiable cato be aweinspiring we would like our friends to resemble caesar but our ambition for ourselves would be to resemble cato similarly the approval we give to temperance or industry or frugality may be somewhat different from our approval of the social virtuesbut not so different as to make them completely different species of approval i believe that most people will naturally and unhesitatingly agree with what an elegant and judicious poet write virtue for mere goodnature be a fool be sense and spirit with humanity what claim do a man have to our generous assistance if he have dissipate his wealth in luxurious expense idle vanities fatuous project dissolute pleasures or extravagant gamble these vices i do call them vices bring unpitied misery and contempt on everyone who be addict to them achaeus a wise and prudent prince fell into a trap that cost him his crown and his life after he have use every reasonable precaution to guard himself against it on that account say the historian polybius he deserve both respect and compassion only those who betray him merit hatred and contempt pompeys sudden flight and rash negligence at the start of the civil war strike cicero as such notorious blunder that they wipe out his friendship towards that great man he compare the effect on him of this behaviour of pompeys with the way we would be affect by lack of cleanliness or decency or discretion in a mistress thats how cicero put it when speak in his role not as a philosopher but as a statesman and man of the world but when this same cicero be think like a philosopher he follow all the ancient moralists in present a very broad idea of virtue give that honourable label to every praiseworthy quality or endowment of the mind this lead me to hume have a longish footnote about differences in emotional response to various charactertraits focus mainly on love and admiration he throw in another example there seem to be a stronger mixture of pride in contempt than of humility in admiration and it wouldnt be hard to work out why if one make a careful study of all the passions all these various mixtures and compositions and appearances of sentiment make a challenge subject of theoretical investigation but they arent relevant to my present topic throughout the present enquiry i have always consider in a general way what qualities be praise or blame without go into all the minute differences of sentiment that they arouse the ancient moralists the best model attach little weight to any differences among the different kinds of mental endowments and defect treat them all alike as virtues or vices and bring them all within the scope of their moral reason in the classification adopt by that eloquent moralist cicero our social duties constitute merely one of four main kinds of virtue at this point hume have a footnote quote in latin a passage by cicero which he say clearly and explicitly make his hum point the ancient moralists the best model attach little weight to any differences among the different kinds of mental endowments and defect treat them all alike as virtues or vices and bring them all within the scope of their moral reason in the classification adopt by that eloquent moralist cicero our social duties constitute merely one of four main kinds of virtue at this point hume have a footnote quote in latin a passage by cicero which he say clearly and explicitly make his hum point we need only glance through the chaptertitles in aristotles ethical work to be convince that he take the virtues to include not only justice and friendship but also courage temperance magnificence magnanimity modesty prudence and manly openness for some of the ancients all morality be sum up in sustain and abstain ie be patient and continent thats a morality that tell us to put up with the blow that fate land on us and to refrain from various kinds of misconduct hum point presumably be that such a morality be notably distant from emphasize virtue in anything like his or our sense of the word epictetus hardly ever mention the sentiment of humanity and compassion except to warn his disciples against it the virtue of the stoics seem to consist mainly in a firm temperament and a good intellect with them as with solomon and the eastern moralists folly and wisdom be equivalent to vice and virtue respectively men will praise thee say david when thou dost well unto thyself psalm the greek poet euripedes say i hate a wise man who isnt wise to himself plutarch doesnt let systems of morality cramp his style in his philosophy any more than in his history when he compare the great men of greece and rome he set out all their blemish and accomplishments of whatever kind include everything significant that could either lower or raise their moral stand his moral discourse contain the same free and natural censure of men and manners livys description of the character of hannibal be regard as bias but it do allow him many eminent virtues accord to livy before hannibal there have never be anyone as well equip as he be for both of his opposite rolescommanding and obeyingso that it would be hard to decide whether he be value more by the general whom he obey or by the army which he command there be noone to whom the general hasdrubal would more willingly entrust the conduct of any dangerous enterprise and noone under whom the soldier reveal more courage and confidence great boldness in face danger great prudence in the midst of it no labour could fatigue his body or subdue his mind cold and heat mean nothing to him food and drink he seek as something need to keep him alive not as gratifications of luxurious appetites wake or rest he use indiscriminately by night or by day these great virtues be balance by great vicesinhuman cruelty treacherousness that be extreme even for a carthaginian no truth no faith no respect for oaths or promise or religion the character of pope alexander vi as draw by the historian guicciardini be pretty similar but less bias and it show that even the moderns when they speak naturally use the same moral language as the ancients this pope say the historian have a singular capacity and judgment admirable prudence a wonderful talent for persuasion and in any important enterprise incredible diligence and dexterity but these virtues be infinitely outweigh by his vicesno faith no religion insatiable greed extravagant ambition and more than barbarous cruelty polybius regard the sicilian leader agathocles as the most cruel and impious of all tyrants but he still rebuke timaeus for give such a onesidedly negative account of him from timaeus himself polybius say we learn this about agathocles he take refuge in syracuse flee the dirt and smoke and toil of his former profession as a potter from such humble beginnings he rise quite quickly to be the master of all sicily he put the carthaginian state in the utmost danger and he die as an old man in possession of sovereign dignity if all that be right say polybius shouldnt it be grant that there be something prodigious and extraordinary about him and that he have great talents and capacity for business and action his historian oughtnt have record only what tend to his reproach and infamy but also what might redound to his praise and honour we may notice that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary wasnt attend to much by the ancients in their moral reason as witness the fact that they often treat the question can virtue be teach as genuinely open hume refer to plato seneca horace and one other writer then they rightly think that cowardice meanness frivolity anxiety impatience folly and many other qualities of the mind might appear ridiculous and deform contemptible and odious even though they be independent of the will and it couldnt be suppose that everyone always have the power to attain every kind of mental excellence any more than the power to become physically beautiful why in their moral enquiries have modern philosophers often follow such a different course from that of the ancients in later time philosophy of all kinds and especially ethics have be more closely unite with theology than be ever the case with the heathens and that have make a big difference because theology wont bargain or compromise but bend every branch of knowledge to its own purpose without much regard to the phenomena of nature or to the unbiassed sentiments of the mind because of this intransigence reason and even language have be warp from their natural course and people have try to establish verbal distinctions where the difference in the object be virtually imperceptible philosophers or rather theologians disguise as philosophers have treat all morals as on a par with civil laws guard by the sanction of reward and punishment and this have inevitably lead them to put the voluntaryinvoluntary distinction at the foundation of their whole theory well anyone may use word in whatever sense he like but they ought to concede that people often have sentiments of blame and praise that they direct at items that dont fall within the scope of will or choice and that we oughtif not as moralists then as theoretical philosophersto give some satisfactory theory and explanation of this phenomenon a blemish a fault a vice a crimethese expressions seem to express different degrees of censure and disapproval but they be all basically pretty
