an essay towards a new theory of vision by george berkeley content sect design distance of itself invisible remote distance perceive rather by experience than by sense near distance think to be perceive by the angle of the optic ax difference between this and the former manner of perceive distance also by diverge ray this depend not on experience these the common account but not satisfactory some ideas perceive by the mediation of others no idea which be not itself perceive can be the mean of perceive another distance perceive by mean of some other idea those line and angle mention in optics be not themselves perceive hence the mind do not perceive distance by line and angle also because they have no real existence and because they be insufficient to explain the phenomena the ideas that suggest distance be st the sensation arise from the turn of the eye betwixt which and distance there be no necessary connection scarce room for mistake in this matter no regard have to the angle of the optic ax judgment of distance make with both eye the result of experience ndly confusedness of appearance this the occasion of those judgments attribute to diverge ray objection answer what deceive the writers of optics in this matter the cause why one idea may suggest another this apply to confusion and distance thirrdly the strain of the eye the occasion which suggest distance have in their own nature no relation to it a difficult case propose by dr barrow as repugnant to all the know theories this case contradict a receive principle in catoptrics it be show to agree with the principles we have lay down this phenomenon illustrate it confirm the truth of the principle whereby it be explain vision when distinct and when confuse the different effect of parallel diverge and converge ray how converge and diverge ray come to suggest the same distance a person extreme purblind would judge aright in the forementioned case line and angle why useful in optics the not understand this a cause of mistake a query propose by mr molyneux in his dioptrics consider one bear blind would not at first have any idea of distance by sight this not agreeable to the common principles the proper object of sight not without the mind nor the image of any thing without the mind this more fully explain in what sense we must be understand to see distance and external things distance and things place at a distance not otherwise perceive by the eye than by the ear the ideas of sight more apt to be confound with the ideas of touch than those of hear be how this come to pass strictly speak we never see and feel the same thing object of sight twofold mediate and immediate these hard to separate in our thoughts the receive account of our perceive magnitude by sight false magnitude perceive as immediately as distance two kinds of sensible extension neither of which be infinitely divisible the tangible magnitude of an object steady the visible not by what mean tangible magnitude be perceive by sight this further enlarge on no necessary connection between confusion or faintness of appearance and small or great magnitude the tangible magnitude of an object more heed than the visible and why an instance of this men do not measure by visible feet or inch no necessary connection between visible and tangible extension greater visible magnitude might signify lesser tangible magnitude the judgments we make of magnitude depend altogether on experience distance and magnitude see as shame or anger but we be prone to think otherwise and why the moon seem greater in the horizon than in the meridian the cause of this phenomenon assign the horizontal moon why greater at one time than another the account we have give prove to be true and confirm by the moon appear greater in a mist objection answer the way wherein faintness suggest greater magnitude illustrate appearance of the horizontal moon why think difficult to explain attempt towards the solution of it make by several but in vain the opinion of dr wallis it be show to be unsatisfactory how line and angle may be of use in compute apparent magnitudes one bear blind be make to see what judgment he would make of magnitude the minimum visible the same to all creatures objection answer the eye at all time perceive the same number of visible point two imperfections in the visive faculty answer to which we may conceive two perfections in neither of these two ways do microscopes improve the sight the case of microscopical eye consider the sight admirably adapt to the end of see difficulty concern erect vision the common way of explain it the same show to be false not distinguish between ideas of sight and touch cause of mistake in this matter the case of one bear blind proper to be consider such a one might by touch attain to have ideas of upper and lower which modes of situation he would attribute only to things tangible he would not at first sight think anything he saw high or low erect or invert this illustrate by an example by what mean he would come to denominate visible object high or low etc why he should think those object highest which be paint on the lowest part of his eye and vice versa how he would perceive by sight the situation of external object our propension to think the contrary no argument against what have be say objection answer an object could not be know at first sight by the colour nor by the magnitude thereof nor by the figure in the first act of vision no tangible thing would be suggest by sight difficulty propose concern number number of things visible would not at first sight suggest the like number of things tangible number the creature of the mind one bear blind would not at first sight number visible things as others do the situation of any object determine with respect only to object of the same sense no distance great or small between a visible and tangible thing the not observe this cause of difficulty in erect vision which otherwise include nothing unaccountable what be mean by the picture be invert cause of mistake in this matter image in the eye not picture of external object in what sense they be picture in this affair we must carefully distinguish between ideas of sight and touch difficult to explain by word the true theory of vision the question whether there be any idea common to sight and touch state abstract extension inquire into it be incomprehensible abstract extension not the object of geometry the general idea of a triangle consider vacuum or pure space not common to sight and touch there be no idea or kind of idea common to both sense first argument in proof hereof second argument visible figure and extension not distinct ideas from colour third argument confirmation draw from mr molyneuxs problem of a sphere and a cube publish by mr locke which be falsely solve if the common supposition be true more might be say in proof of our tenet but this suffice further reflection on the forego problem the same thing doth not affect both sight and touch the same idea of motion not common to sight and touch the way wherein we apprehend motion by sight easily collect from what hath be say qu how visible and tangible ideas come to have the same name if not of the same kind this account for without suppose them of the same kind obj that a tangible square be liker to a visible square than to a visible circle ans that a visible square be fitter than a visible circle to represent a tangible square but it doth not hence follow that a visible square be like a tangible square why we be more apt to confound visible with tangible ideas than other sign with the things signify several other reason hereof assign reluctancy in reject any opinion no argument of its truth proper object of vision the language of nature in it there be much admirable and deserve our attention question propose concern the object of geometry at first view we be apt to think visible extension the object of geometry visible extension show not to be the object of geometry word may as well be think the object of geometry as visible extension it be propose to inquire what progress an intelligence that could see but not feel might make in geometry he can not understand those part which relate to solids and their surface and line generate by their section nor even the elements of plane geometry the proper object of sight incapable of be manage as geometrical figure the opinion of those who hold plane figure to be the immediate object of sight consider plan no more the immediate object of sight than solids difficult to enter precisely into the thoughts of the abovementioned intelligence the object of geometry its not be sufficiently understand cause of difficulty and useless labour in that science an essay towards a new theory of vision my design be to show the manner wherein we perceive by sight the distance magnitude and situation of object also to consider the difference there be betwixt the ideas of sight and touch and whether there be any idea common to both sense it be i think agree by all that distance of itself and immediately can not be see for distance be a line direct endwise to the eye it project only one point in the fund of the eye which point remain invariably the same whether the distance be longer or shorter i find it also acknowledge that the estimate we make of the distance of object considerably remote be rather an act of judgment ground on experience than of sense for example when i perceive a great number of intermediate object such as house field rivers and the like which i have experience to take up a considerable space i thence form a judgment or conclusion that the object i see beyond them be at a great distance again when an object appear faint and small which at a near distance i have experience to make a vigorous and large appearance i instantly conclude it to be far off and this it be evident be the result of experience without which from the faintness and littleness i should not have infer anything concern the distance of object but when an object be place at so near a distance as that the interval between the eye bear any sensible proportion to it the opinion of speculative men be that the two optic ax the fancy that we see only with one eye at once be explode concur at the object do there make an angle by mean of which accord as it be greater or lesser the object be perceive to be nearer or farther off betwixt which and the forego manner of estimate distance there be this remarkable difference that whereas there be no apparent necessary connection between small distance and a large and strong appearance or between great distance and a little and faint appearance there appear a very necessary connection between an obtuse angle and near distance and an acute angle and farther distance it do not in the least depend upon experience but may be evidently know by anyone before he have experience it that the nearer the concurrence of the optic ax the greater the angle and the remoter their concurrence be the lesser will be the angle comprehend by them there be another way mention by optic writers whereby they will have us judge of those distance in respect of which the breadth of the pupil hath any sensible bigness and that be the greater or lesser divergency of the ray which issue from the visible point do fall on the pupil that point be judge nearest which be see by most diverge ray and that remoter which be see by less diverge ray and so on the apparent distance still increase as the divergency of the ray decrease till at length it become infinite when the ray that fall on the pupil be to sense parallel and after this manner it be say we perceive distance when we look only with one eye in this case also it be plain we be not behold to experience it be a certain necessary truth that the nearer the direct ray fall on the eye approach to a parallelism the farther off be the point of their intersection or the visible point from whence they flow i have here set down the common current account that be give of our perceive near distance by sight which though they be unquestionably receive for true by mathematicians and accordingly make use of by them in determine the apparent place of object do nevertheless seem to me very unsatisfactory and that for these follow reason first it be evident that when the mind perceive any idea not immediately and of itself it must be by the mean of some other idea thus for instance the passions which be in the mind of another be of themselves to me invisible i may nevertheless perceive them by sight though not immediately yet by mean of the colour they produce in the countenance we often see shame or fear in the look of a man by perceive the change of his countenance to red or pale moreover it be evident that no idea which be not itself perceive can be the mean of perceive any other idea if i do not perceive the redness or paleness of a man face themselves it be impossible i should perceive by them the passions which be in his mind now from sect it be plain that distance be in its own nature imperceptible and yet it be perceive by sight it remain therefore that it be bring into view by mean of some other idea that be itself immediately perceive in the act of vision but those line and angle by mean whereof some mathematicians pretend to explain the perception of distance be themselves not at all perceive nor be they in truth ever think of by those unskilful in optics i appeal to anyones experience whether upon sight of an object he compute its distance by the bigness of the angle make by the meet of the two optic ax or whether he ever think of the greater or lesser divergency of the ray which arrive from any point to his pupil everyone be himself the best judge of what he perceive and what not in vain shall all the mathematicians in the world tell me that i perceive certain line and angle which introduce into my mind the various ideas of distance so long as i myself be conscious of no such thing since therefore those angle and line be not themselves perceive by sight it follow from sect that the mind doth not by them judge of the distance of object secondly the truth of this assertion will be yet farther evident to anyone that consider those line and angle have no real existence in nature be only an hypothesis frame by the mathematicians and by them introduce into optics that they might treat of that science in a geometrical way the third and last reason i shall give for reject that doctrine be that though we should grant the real existence of those optic angle etc and that it be possible for the mind to perceive them yet these principles would not be find sufficient to explain the phenomena of distance as shall be show hereafter now it be already show that distance be suggest to the mind by the mediation of some other idea which be itself perceive in the act of see it remain that we inquire what ideas or sensations there be that attend vision unto which we may suppose the ideas of distance be connect and by which they be introduce into the mind and first it be certain by experience that when we look at a near object with both eye accord as it approach or recede from us we alter the disposition of our eye by lessen or widen the interval between the pupils this disposition or turn of the eye be attend with a sensation which seem to me to be that which in this case bring the idea of greater or lesser distance into the mind not that there be any natural or necessary connection between the sensation we perceive by the turn of the eye and greater or lesser distance but because the mind have by constant experience find the different sensations correspond to the different dispositions of the eye to be attend each with a different degree of distance in the object there have grow an habitual or customary connection between those two sort of ideas so that the mind no sooner perceive the sensation arise from the different turn it give the eye in order to bring the pupils nearer or farther asunder but it withal perceive the different idea of distance which be wont to be connect with that sensation just as upon hear a certain sound the idea be immediately suggest to the understand which custom have unite with it nor do i see how i can easily be mistake in this matter i know evidently that distance be not perceive of itself that by consequence it must be perceive by mean of some other idea which be immediately perceive and vary with the different degrees of distance i know also that the sensation arise from the turn of the eye be of itself immediately perceive and various degrees thereof be connect with different distance which never fail to accompany them into my mind when i view an object distinctly with both eye whose distance be so small that in respect of it the interval between the eye have any considerable magnitude i know it be a receive opinion that by alter the disposition of the eye the mind perceive whether the angle of the optic ax be make greater or lesser and that accordingly by a kind of natural geometry it judge the point of their intersection to be nearer or farther off but that this be not true i be convince by my own experience since i be not conscious that i make any such use of the perception i have by the turn of my eye and for me to make those judgments and draw those conclusions from it without know that i do so seem altogether incomprehensible from all which it follow that the judgment we make of the distance of an object view with both eye be entirely the result of experience if we have not constantly find certain sensations arise from the various disposition of the eye attend with certain degrees of distance we should never make those sudden judgments from them concern the distance of object no more than we would pretend to judge a man thoughts by his pronounce word we have never hear before secondly an object place at a certain distance from the eye to which the breadth of the pupil bear a considerable proportion be make to approach be see more confusedly and the nearer it be bring the more confuse appearance it make and this be find constantly to be so there ariseth in the mind an habitual connection between the several degrees of confusion and distance the greater confusion still imply the lesser distance and the lesser confusion the greater distance of the object this confuse appearance of the object doth therefore seem to be the medium whereby the mind judgeth of distance in those case wherein the most approve writers of optics will have it judge by the different divergency with which the ray flow from the radiate point fall on the pupil no man i believe will pretend to see or feel those imaginary angle that the ray be suppose to form accord to their various inclinations on his eye but he can not choose see whether the object appear more or less confuse it be therefore a manifest consequence from what bath be demonstrate that instead of the greater or lesser divergency of the ray the mind make use of the greater or lesser confusedness of the appearance thereby to determine the apparent place of an object nor doth it avail to say there be not any necessary connection between confuse vision and distance great or small for i ask any man what necessary connection he see between the redness of a blush and shame and yet no sooner shall he behold that colour to arise in the face of another but it bring into his and the idea of that passion which hath be observe to accompany it what seem to have mislead the writers of optics in this matter be that they imagine men judge of distance as they do of a conclusion in mathematics betwixt which and the premise it be indeed absolutely requisite there be an apparent necessary connection but it be far otherwise in the sudden judgments men make of distance we be not to think that brutes and children or even grow reasonable men whenever they perceive an object to approach or depart from them do it by virtue of geometry and demonstration that one idea may suggest another to the mind it will suffice that they have be observe to go together without any demonstration of the necessity of their coexistence or without so much as know what it be that make them so to coexist of this there be innumerable instance of which no one can be ignorant thus greater confusion have be constantly attend with nearer distance no sooner be the former idea perceive but it suggest the latter to our thoughts and if it have be the ordinary course of nature that the farther off an object be place the more confuse it should appear it be certain the very same perception that now make us think an object approach would then have make us to imagine it go farther off that perception abstract from custom and experience be equally fit to produce the idea of great distance or small distance or no distance at all thirdly an object be place at the distance above specify and bring nearer to the eye we may nevertheless prevent at least for some time the appearances grow more confuse by strain the eye in which case that sensation supply the place of confuse vision in aid the mind to judge of the distance of the object it be esteem so much the nearer by how much the effort or strain of the eye in order to distinct vision be greater i have here set down those sensations or ideas that seem to be the constant and general occasion of introduce into the mind the different ideas of near distance it be true in most case that divers other circumstances contribute to frame our idea of distance to wit the particular number size kind etc of the things see concern which as well as all other the forementioned occasion which suggest distance i shall only observe they have none of them in their own nature any relation or connection with it nor be it possible they should ever signify the various degrees thereof otherwise than as by experience they have be find to be connect with them i shall proceed upon these principles to account for a phenomenon which have hitherto strangely puzzle the writers of optics and be so far from be account for by any of their theories of vision that it be by their own confession plainly repugnant to them and of consequence if nothing else could be object be alone sufficient to bring their credit in question the whole difficulty i shall lay before you in the word of the learn dr barrow with which he conclude his optic lecture i have here deliver what my thoughts have suggest to me concern that part of optics which be more properly mathematical as for the other part of that science which be rather physical do consequently abound with plausible conjecture instead of certain principles there have in them scarce anything occur to my observation different from what have be already say by kepler scheinerus descartes and others and methinks i have better say nothing at all than repeat that which have be so often say by others i think it therefore high time to take my leave of this subject but before i quit it for good and all the fair and ingenuous deal that i owe both to you and to truth obligeth me to acquaint you with a certain untoward difficulty which seem directly opposite to the doctrine i have be hitherto inculcate at least admit of no solution from it in short it be this before the double convex glass or concave speculum ebf let the point a be place at such a distance that the ray proceed from a after refraction or reflection be bring to unite somewhere in the axab and suppose the point of union ie the image of the point a as hath be already set forth to be z between which and b the vertex of the glass or speculum conceive the eye to be anywhere place the question now be where the point a ought to appear experience show that it do not appear behind at the point z and it be contrary to nature that it should since all the impression which affect the sense come from towards a but from our tenets it should seem to follow that it would appear before the eye at a vast distance off so great as should in some sort surpass all sensible distance for since if we exclude all anticipations and prejudice every object appear by so much the farther off by how much the ray it send to the eye be less diverge and that object be think to be most remote from which parallel ray proceed unto the eye reason would make one think that object should appear at yet a greater distance which be see by converge ray moreover it may in general be ask concern this case what it be that determine the apparent place of the point a and maketh it to appear after a constant manner sometimes nearer at other time farther off to which doubt i see nothing that can be answer agreeable to the principles we have lay down except only that the point a ought always to appear extremely remote but on the contrary we be assure by experience that the point a appear variously distant accord to the different situations of the eye between the point b and z and that it doth never if at all seem farther off than it would if it be behold by the naked eye but on the contrary it doth sometimes appear much nearer nay it be even certain that by how much the ray fall on the eye do more converge by so much the nearer doth the object seem to approach for the eye be place close to the point b the object a appear nearly in its own natural place if the point b be take in the glass or at the same distance if in the speculum the eye be bring back to o the object seem to draw near and be come to p it behold it still nearer and so on little and little till at length the eye be place somewhere suppose at q the object appear extremely near begin to vanish into mere confusion all which doth seem repugnant to our principles at least not rightly to agree with them nor be our tenet alone strike at by this experiment but likewise all others that ever come to my knowledge be every whit as much endanger by it the ancient one especially which be most commonly receive and come nearest to mine seem to be so effectually overthrow thereby that the most learn tacquet have be force to reject that principle as false and uncertain on which alone he have build almost his whole catoptrics and consequently by take away the foundation hath himself pull down the superstructure he have raise on it which nevertheless i do not believe he would have do have he but consider the whole matter more thoroughly and examine the difficulty to the bottom but as for me neither this nor any other difficulty shall have so great an influence on me as to make me renounce that which i know to be manifestly agreeable to reason especially when as it here fall out the difficulty be found in the peculiar nature of a certain odd and particular case for in the present case something peculiar lie hide which be involve in the subtilty of nature will perhaps hardly be discover till such time as the manner of vision be more perfectly make know concern which i must own i have hitherto be able to find out nothing that have the least show of probability not to mention certainty i shall therefore leave this knot to be untie by you wish you may have better success in it than i have have the ancient and receive principle which dr barrow here mention as the main foundation of tacquets catoptrics be that every visible point see by reflection from a speculum shall appear place at the intersection of the reflect ray and the perpendicular of incidence which intersection in the present case happen to be behind the eye it greatly shake the authority of that principle whereon the aforementioned author proceed throughout his whole catoptrics in determine the apparent place of object see by reflection from any kind of speculum let us now see how this phenomenon agree with our tenets the eye the nearer it be place to the point b in the forego figure the more distinct be the appearance of the object but as it recede to o the appearance grow more confuse and at p it see the object yet more confuse and so on till the eye be bring back to z see the object in the greatest confusion of all wherefore by sect the object should seem to approach the eye gradually as it recede from the point b that be at o it should in consequence of the principle i have lay down in the aforesaid section seem nearer than it do at b and at p nearer than at o and at q nearer than at p and so on till it quite vanish at z which be the very matter of fact as anyone that please may easily satisfy himself by experiment this case be much the same as if we should suppose an englishman to meet a foreigner who use the same word with the english but in a direct contrary signification the englishman would not fail to make a wrong judgment of the ideas annex to those sound in the mind of him that use them just so in the present case the object speak if i may so say with word that the eye be well acquaint with that be confusions of appearance but whereas heretofore the greater confusions be always wont to signify nearer distance they have in this case a direct contrary signification be connect with the greater distance whence it follow that the eye must unavoidably be mistake since it will take the confusions in the sense it have be use to which be directly oppose to the true this phenomenon as it entirely subvert the opinion of those who will have us judge of distance by line and angle on which supposition it be altogether inexplicable so it seem to me no small confirmation of the truth of that principle whereby it be explain but in order co a more full explication of this point and to show how far the hypothesis of the mind judge by the various divergency of ray may be of use in determine the apparent place of an object it will be necessary to premise some few things which be already well know to those who have any skill in dioptrics first any radiate point be then distinctly see when the ray proceed from it be by the refractive power of the crystalline accurately reunite in the retina or fund of the eye but if they be reunite either before they arrive at the retina or after they have pass it then there be confuse vision secondly suppose in the adjacent figure np represent an eye duly frame and retain its natural figure in fig the ray fall nearly parallel on the eye be by the crystalline ab refract so as their focus or point of union f fall exactly on the retina but if the ray fall sensibly diverge on the eye as in fig then their focus fall beyond the retina or if the ray be make to converge by the lens qs before they come at the eye as in fig their focus f will fall before the retina in which two last case it be evident from the forego section that the appearance of the point z be confuse and by how much the greater be the convergency or divergency of the ray fall on the pupil by so much the farther will the point of their reunion be from the retina either before or behind it and consequently the point z will appear by so much the more confuse and this by the bye may show us the difference between confuse and faint vision confuse vision be when the ray proceed from each distinct point of the object be not accurately recollect in one correspond point on the retina but take up some space thereon so that ray from different point become mix and confuse together this be oppose to a distinct vision and attend near object faint vision be when by reason of the distance of the object or grossness of the interjacent medium few ray arrive from the object to the eye this be oppose to vigorous or clear vision and attend remote object but to return the eye or to speak truly the mind perceive only the confusion itself without ever consider the cause from which it proceed doth constantly annex the same degree of distance to the same degree of confusion whether that confusion be occasion by converge or by diverge ray it matter not whence it follow that the eye view the object z through the glass qs which by refraction causeth the ray zq zs etc to converge should judge it to be at such a nearness at which if it be place it would radiate on the eye with ray diverge to that degree as would produce the same confusion which be now produce by converge ray ie would cover a portion of the retina equal to dc vid fig supra but then this must be understand to use dr barrows phrase seclusis praenotionibus et praejudiciis in case we abstract from all other circumstances of vision such as the figure size faintness etc of the visible object all which do ordinarily concur to form our idea of distance the mind have by frequent experience observe their several sort or degrees to be connect with various distance it plainly follow from what hath be say that a person perfectly purblind ie that could not see an object distinctly but when place close to his eye would not make the same wrong judgment that others do in the forementioned case for to him greater confusions constantly suggest greater distance he must as he recede from the glass and the object grow more confuse judge it to be at a farther distance contrary to what they do who have have the perception of the object grow more confuse connect with the idea of approach hence also it doth appear there may be good use of computation by line and angle in optics not that the mind judgeth of distance immediately by them but because it judgeth by somewhat which be connect with them and to the determination whereof they may be subservient thus the mind judge of the distance of an object by the confusedness of its appearance and this confusedness be greater or lesser to the naked eye accord as the object be see by ray more or less diverge it follow that a man may make use of the divergency of the ray in compute the apparent distance though not for its own sake yet on account of the confusion with which it be connect but so it be the confusion itself be entirely neglect by mathematicians as have no necessary relation with distance such as the greater or lesser angle of divergency be conceive to have and these especially for that they fall under mathematical computation be alone regard in determine the apparent place of object as though they be the sole and immediate cause of the judgments the mind make of distance whereas in truth they should not at all be regard in themselves or any otherwise than as they be suppose to be the cause of confuse vision the not consider of this have be a fundamental and perplex oversight for proof whereof we need go no farther than the case before us it have be observe that the most diverge ray bring into the mind the idea of nearest distance and that still as the divergency decrease the distance increase and it be think the connexion between the various degrees of divergency and distance be immediate this naturally lead one to conclude from an illgrounded analogy that converge ray shall make an object appear at an immense distance and that as the convergency increase the distance if it be possible should do so likewise that this be the cause of dr barrows mistake be evident from his own word which we have quote whereas have the learn doctor observe that diverge and converge ray how opposite soever they may seem do nevertheless agree in produce the same effect to wit confusedness of vision greater degrees whereof be produce indifferently either as the divergency or convergency and the ray increaseth and that it be by this effect which be the same in both that either the divergency or convergency be perceive by the eye i say have he but consider this it be certain he would have make a quite contrary judgment and rightly conclude that those ray which fall on the eye with greater degrees of convergency should make the object from whence they proceed appear by so much the nearer but it be plain it be impossible for any man to attain to a right notion of this matter so long as he have regard only to line and angle and do not apprehend the true nature of vision and how far it be of mathematical consideration before we dismiss this subject it be fit we take notice of a query relate thereto propose by the ingenious mr molyneux be his treatise of dioptricspar i prop sect where speak of this difficulty he have these word and so he ie dr barrow leave this difficulty to the solution of others which i after so great an example shall do likewise but with the resolution of the same admirable author of not quit the evident doarine which we have before lay down for determine the locus objecti on account of be press by one difficulty which seem inexplicable till a more intimate knowledge of the visive faculty be obtain by mortals in the meantime i propose it to the consideration of the ingenious whether the locus apparens of an object place as in this th section be not as much before the eye as the distinct base be behind the eye to which query we may venture to answer in the negative for in the present case the rule for determine the distance of the distinct base or respective focus from the glass be this as the difference between the distance of the object and focus be to the focus or focal length so the distance of the object from the glass be to the distance of the respective focus or distinct base from the glass molyneux dioptr par i prop let us now suppose the object to be place at the distance of the focal length and one half of the focal length from the glass and the eye close to the glass hence it will follow by the rule that the distance of the distinct base behind the eye be double the true distance of the object before the eye if therefore mr molyneuxs conjecture hold good it would follow that the eye should see the object twice as far off as it really be and in other case at three or four time its due distance or more but this manifestly contradict experience the object never appear at farthest beyond its due distance whatever therefore be build on this supposition vid corol i prop ibid come to the grind along with it from what hath be premise it be a manifest consequence that a man bear blind be make to see would at first have no idea of distance by sight the sun and star the remotest object as well as the nearer would all seem to be in his eye or rather in his mind the object intromit by sight would seem to him as in truth they be no other than a new set of thoughts or sensations each whereof be as near to him as the perceptions of pain or pleasure or the most inward passions of his soul for our judge object provide by sight to be at any distance or without the mind be vid sect entirely the effect of experience which one in those circumstances could not yet have attain to it be indeed otherwise upon the common supposition that men judge of distance by the angle of the optic ax just as one in the dark or a blindman by the angle comprehend by two stick one whereof he hold in each hand for if this be true it would follow that one blind from his birth be make to see should stand in need of no new experience in order to perceive distance by sight but that this be false have i think be sufficiently demonstrate and perhaps upon a strict inquiry we shall not find that even those who from their birth have grow up in a continue habit of see be irrecoverably prejudice on the other side to wit in think what they see to be at a distance from them for at this time it seem agree on all hand by those who have have any thoughts of that matter that colour which be the proper and immediate object of sight be not without the mind but then it will be say by sight we have also the ideas of extension and figure and motion all which may well be think without and at some distance from the mind though colour should not in answer to this i appeal to any man experience whether the visible extension of any object doth not appear as near to him as the colour of that object nay whether they do not both seem to be in the very same place be not the extension we see colour and be it possible for us so much as in think to separate and abstract colour from extension now where the extension be there surely be the figure and there the motion too i speak of those which be perceive by sight but for a fuller explication of this point and to show that the immediate object of sight be not so much as the ideas or resemblances of things place at a distance it be requisite that we look nearer into the matter and carefully observe what be mean in common discourse when one say that which he see be at a distance from him suppose for example that look at the moon i should say it be fifty or sixty semidiameters of the earth distant from me let us see what moon this be speak of it be plain it can not be the visible moon or anything like the visible moon or that which i see which be only a round luminous plane of about thirty visible point in diameter for in case i be carry from the place where i stand directly towards the moon it be manifest the object vary still as i go on and by the time that i be advance fifty or sixty semidiameters of the earth i shall be so far from be near a small round luminous flat that i shall perceive nothing like it this object have long since disappear and if i would recover it it must be by go back to the earth from whence i set out again suppose i perceive by sight the faint and obscure idea of something which i doubt whether it be a man or a tree or a tower but judge it to be at the distance of about a mile it be plain i can not mean that what i see be a mile off or that it be the image or liken of anything which be a mile off since that every step i take towards it the appearance alter and from be obscure small and faint grow clear large and vigorous and when i come to the miles end that which i saw first be quite lose neither do i find anything in the liken of it in these and the like instance the truth of the matter stand thus have of a long time experience certain ideas perceivable by touch as distance tangible figure and solidity to have be connect with certain ideas of sight i do upon perceive these ideas of sight forthwith conclude what tangible ideas be by the wonted ordinary course of nature like to follow look at an object i perceive a certain visible figure and colour with some degree of faintness and other circumstances which from what i have formerly observe determine me to think that if i advance forward so many pace or miles i shall be affect with such and such ideas of touch so that in truth and strictness of speech i neither see distance itself nor anything that i take to be at a distance i say neither distance nor things place at a distance be themselves or their ideas truly perceive by sight this i be persuade of as to what concern myself and i believe whoever will look narrowly into his own thoughts and examine what he mean by say he see this or that thing at a distance will agree with me that what he see only suggest to his understand that after have pass a certain distance to be measure by the motion of his body which be perceivable by touch he shall come to perceive such and such tangible ideas which have be usually connect with such and such visible ideas but that one might be deceive by these suggestions of sense and that there be no necessary connexion between visible and tangible ideas suggest by them we need go no farther than the next lookingglass or picture to be convince note that when i speak of tangible ideas i take the word idea for any the immediate object of sense or understand in which large signification it be commonly use by the moderns from what we have show it be a manifest consequence that the ideas of space outness and things place at a distance be not strictly speak the object of sight they be not otherwise perceive by the eye than by the ear sit in my study i hear a coach drive along the street i look through the casement and see it i walk out and enter into it thus common speech would incline one to think i hear saw and touch the same thing to wit the coach it be nevertheless certain the ideas intromit by each sense be widely different and distinct from each other but have be observe constantly to go together they be speak of as one and the same thing by the variation of the noise i perceive the different distance of the coach and know that it approach before i look out thus by the ear i perceive distance just after the same manner as i do by the eye i do not nevertheless say i hear distance in like manner as i say that i see it the ideas perceive by hear not be so apt to be confound with the ideas of touch as those of sight be so likewise a man be easily convince that body and external things be not properly the object of hear but only sound by the mediation whereof the idea of this or that body or distance be suggest to his thoughts but then one be with more difficulty bring to discern the difference there be betwixt the ideas of sight and touch though it be certain a man no more see and feel the same thing than he hear and feel the same thing one reason of which seem to be this it be think a great absurdity to imagine that one and the same thing should have any more than one extension and one figure but the extension and figure of a body be let into the mind two ways and that indifferently either by sight or touch it seem to follow that we see the same extension and the same figure which we feel but if we take a close and accurate view of things it must be acknowledge that we never see and feel one and the same object that which be see be one thing and that which be felt be another if the visible figure and extension be not the same with the tangible figure and extension we be not to infer that one and the same thing have divers extensions the true consequence be that the object of sight and touch be two distinct things it may perhaps require some think rightly to conceive this distinction and the difficulty seem not a little increase because the combination of visible ideas hath constantly the same name as the combination of tangible ideas wherewith it be connect which doth of necessity arise from the use and end of language in order therefore to treat accurately and unconfusedly of vision we must bear in mind that there be two sort of object apprehend by the eye the one primarily and immediately the other secondarily and by intervention of the former those of the first sort neither be nor appear to be without the mind or at any distance off they may indeed grow greater or smaller more confuse or more clear or more faint but they do not can not approach or recede from us whenever we say an object be at a distance whenever we say it draw near or go farther off we must always mean it of the latter sort which properly belong to the touch and be not so truly perceive as suggest by the eye in like manner as thoughts by the ear no sooner do we hear the word of a familiar language pronounce in our ears but the ideas correspond thereto present themselves to our mind in the very same instant the sound and the mean enter the understand so closely be they unite that it be not in our power to keep out the one except we exclude the other also we even act in all respect as if we hear the very thoughts themselves so likewise the secondary object or those which be only suggest by sight do often more strongly affect us and be more regard than the proper object of that sense along with which they enter into the mind and with which they have a far more strict connexion than ideas have with word hence it be we find it so difficult to discriminate between the immediate and mediate object of sight and be so prone to attribute to the former what belong only to the latter they be as it be most closely twist blend and incorporate together and the prejudice be confirm and rivet in our thoughts by a long tract of time by the use of language and want of reflexion however i believe anyone that shall attentively consider what we have already say and shall say upon this subject before we have do especially if he pursue it in his own thoughts may be able to deliver himself from that prejudice sure i be it be worth some attention to whoever would understand the true nature of vision i have now do with distance and proceed to show how it be that we perceive by sight the magnitude of object it be the opinion of some that we do it by angle or by angle in conjunction with distance but neither angle nor distance be perceivable by sight and the things we see be in truth at no distance from us it follow that as we have show line and angle not to be the medium the mind make use of in apprehend the apparent place so neither be they the medium whereby it apprehend the apparent magnitude of object it be well know that the same extension at a near distance shall subtend a greater angle and at a farther distance a lesser angle and by this principle we be tell the mind estimate the magnitude of an object compare the angle under which it be see with its distance and thence infer the magnitude thereof what incline men to this mistake beside the humour of make one see by geometry be that the same perceptions or ideas which suggest distance do also suggest magnitude but if we examine it we shall find they suggest the latter as immediately as the former i say they do not first suggest distance and then leave it to the judgment to use that as a medium whereby to collect the magnitude but they have as close and immediate a connexion with the magnitude as with the distance and suggest magnitude as independently of distance as they do distance independently of magnitude all which will be evident to whoever consider what hath be already say and what follow it hath be show there be two sort of object apprehend by sight each whereof hath its distinct magnitude or extension the one properly tangible ie to be perceive and measure by touch and not immediately fall under the sense of see the other properly and immediately visible by mediation of which the former be bring in view each of these magnitudes be greater or lesser accord as they contain in them more or fewer point they be make up of point or minimums for whatever may be say of extension in abstract it be certain sensible extension be not infinitely divisible there be a minimum tangibile and a minimum visibile beyond which sense can not perceive this everyones experience will inform him the magnitude of the object which exist without the mind and be at a distance continue always invariably the same but the visible object still change as you approach to or recede from the tangible object it hath no fix and determinate greatness whenever therefore we speak of the magnitude of anything for instance a tree or a house we must mean the tangible magnitude otherwise there can be nothing steady and free from ambiguity speak of it but though the tangible and visible magnitude in truth belong to two distinct object i shall nevertheless especially since those object be call by the same name and be observe to coexist to avoid tediousness and singularity of speech sometimes speak of them as belong to one and the same thing now in order to discover by what mean the magnitude of tangible object be perceive by sight i need only reflect on what pass in my own mind and observe what those things be which introduce the ideas of greater or lesser into my thoughts when i look on any object and these i find to be first the magnitude or extension of the visible object which be immediately perceive by sight be connect with that other which be tangible and place at a distance secondly the confusion or distinctness and thirdly the vigorousness or faintness of the aforesaid visible appearance ceteris paribus by how much the greater or lesser the visible object be by so much the greater or lesser do i conclude the tangible object to be but be the idea immediately perceive by sight never so large yet if it be withal confuse i judge the magnitude of the thing to be but small if it be distinct and clear i judge it greater and if it be faint i apprehend it to be yet greater what be here mean by confusion and faintness hath be explain in sect moreover the judgments we make of greatness do in like manner as those of distance depend on the disposition of the eye also on the figure number and situation of object and other circumstances that have be observe to attend great or small tangible magnitudes thus for instance the very same quantity of visible extension which in the figure of a tower doth suggest the idea of great magnitude shall in the figure of a man suggest the idea of much smaller magnitude that this be owe to the experience we have have of the usual bigness of a tower and a man no one i suppose need be tell it be also evident that confusion or faintness have no more a necessary connexion with little or great magnitude than they have with little or great distance as they suggest the latter so they suggest the former to our mind and by consequence if it be not for experience we should no more judge a faint or confuse appearance to be connect with great or little magnitude than we should that it be connect with great or little distance nor will it be find that great or small visible magnitude hath any necessary relation to great or small tangible magnitude so that the one may certainly be infer from the other but before we come to the proof of this it be fit we consider the difference there be betwixt the extension and figure which be the proper object of touch and that other which be term visible and how the former be principally though not immediately take notice of when we look at any object this have be before mention but we shall here inquire into the cause thereof we regard the object that environ us in proportion as they be adapt to benefit or injure our own body and thereby produce in our mind the sensation of pleasure or pain now body operate on our organs by an immediate application and the hurt or advantage arise therefrom depend altogether on the tangible and not at all on the visible qualities of any object this be a plain reason why those should be regard by us much more than these and for this end the visive sense seem to have be bestow on animals to wit that by the perception of visible ideas which in themselves be not capable of affect or any wise alter the frame of their body they may be able to foresee from the experience they have have what tangible ideas be connect with such and such visible ideas and damage or benefit which be like to ensue upon the application of their own body to this or that body which be at a distance which foresight how necessary it be to the preservation of an animal everyones experience can inform him hence it be that when we look at an object the tangible figure and extension thereof be principally attend to whilst there be small heed take of the visible figure and magnitude which though more immediately perceive do less concern us and be not fit to produce any alteration in our body that the matter of fact be true will be evident to anyone who consider that a man place at ten foot distance be think as great as if he be place at a distance only of five foot which be true not with relation to the visible but tangible greatness of the object the visible magnitude be far greater at one station than it be at the other inch feet etc be settle state lengths whereby we measure object and estimate their magnitude we say for example an object appear to be six inch or six foot long now that this can not be mean of visible inch etc be evident because a visible inch be itself no constant determinate magnitude and can not therefore serve to mark out and determine the magnitude of any other thing take an inch mark upon a ruler view it successively at the distance of half a foot a foot a foot and a half etc from the eye at each of which and at all the intermediate distance the inch shall have a different visible extension ie there shall be more or fewer point discern in it now i ask which of all these various extensions be that state determinate one that be agree on for a common measure of other magnitudes no reason can be assign why we should pitch on one more than another and except there be some invariable determinate extension fix on to be mark to the word inch it be plain it can be use to little purpose and to say a thing contain this or that number of inch shall imply no more than that it be extend without bring any particular idea of that extension into the mind farther an inch and a foot from different distance shall both exhibit the same visible magnitude and yet at the same time you shall say that one seem several time greater than the other from all which it be manifest that the judgments we make of the magnitude of object by sight be altogether in reference to their tangible extension whenever we say an object be great or small of this or that determinate measure i say it must be mean of the tangible and not the visible extension which though immediately perceive be nevertheless little take notice of now that there be no necessary connexion between these two distinct extensions be evident from hence because our eye might have be frame in such a manner as to be able to see nothing but what be less than the minimum tangibile in which case it be not impossible we might have perceive all the immediate object of sight the very same that we do now but unto those visible appearances there would not be connect those different tangible magnitudes that be now which show the judgments we make of the magnitude of things place at a distance from the various greatness of the immediate object of sight do not arise from any essential or necessary but only a customary tie which have be observe between them moreover it be not only certain that any idea of sight might not have be connect with this or that idea of touch which we now observe to accompany it but also that the greater visible magnitudes might have be connect with and introduce into our mind lesser tangible magnitudes and the lesser visible magnitudes greater tangible magnitudes nay that it actually be so we have daily experience that object which make a strong and large appearance not seem near so great as another the visible magnitude whereof be much less but more faint and the appearance upper or which be the same thing paint lower on the retina which faintness and situation suggest both greater magnitude and greater distance from which and from sect and it be manifest that as we do not perceive the magnitudes of object immediately by sight so neither do we perceive them by the mediation of anything which have a necessary connexion with them those ideas that now suggest unto us the various magnitudes of external object before we touch them might possibly have suggest no such thing or they might have signify them in a direct contrary manner so that the very same ideas on the perception whereof we judge an object to be small might as well have serve to make us conclude it great those ideas be in their own nature equally fit to bring into our mind the idea of small or great or no size at all of outward object just as the word of any language be in their own nature indifferent to signify this or that thing or nothing at all as we see distance so we see magnitude and we see both in the same way that we see shame or anger in the look of a man those passions be themselves invisible they be nevertheless let in by the eye along with colour and alterations of countenance which be the immediate object of vision and which signify them for no other reason than barely because they have be observe to accompany them without which experience we should no more have take blush for a sign of shame than of gladness we be nevertheless exceed prone to imagine those things which be perceive only by the mediation of others to be themselves the immediate object of sight or at least to have in their own nature a fitness to be suggest by them before ever they have be experience to coexist with them from which prejudice everyone perhaps will not find it easy to emancipate himself by any but the clearest convictions of reason and there be some ground to think that if there be one only invariable and universal languages in the world and that men be bear with the faculty of speak it it would be the opinion of many that the ideas of other mens mind be properly perceive by the ear or have at least a necessary and inseparable tie with the sound that be affix to them all which seem to arise from want of a due application of our discern faculty thereby to discriminate between the ideas that be in our understand and consider them apart from each other which would preserve us from confound those that be different and make us see what ideas do and what do not include or imply this or that other idea there be a celebrate phenomenon the solution whereof i shall attempt to give by the principles that have be lay down in reference to the manner wherein we apprehend by sight the magnitude of object the apparent magnitude of the moon when place in the horizon be much greater than when it be in the meridian though the angle under which the diameter of the moon be see be not observe greater in the former case than in the latter and the horizontal moon doth not constantly appear of the same bigness but at some time seemeth far greater than at others now in order to explain the reason of the moon appear greater than ordinary in the horizon it must be observe that the particles which compose our atmosphere intercept the ray of light proceed from any object to the eye and by how much the greater be the portion of atmosphere interjacent between the object and the eye by so much the more be the ray intercept and by consequence the appearance of the object render more faint every object appear more vigorous or more faint in proportion as it sendeth more or fewer ray into the eye now between the eye and the moon when situate in the horizon there lie a far greater quantity of atmosphere than there do when the moon be in the meridian whence it come to pass that the appearance of the horizontal moon be fainter and therefore by sect it should be think bigger in that situation than in the meridian or in any other elevation above the horizon farther the air be variously impregnate sometimes more and sometimes less with vapours and exhalations fit to retund and intercept the ray of light it follow that the appearance of the horizontal moon hath not always an equal faintness and by consequence that luminary though in the very same situation be at one time judge greater than at another that we have here give the true account of the phenomena of the horizontal moon will i suppose be farther evident to anyone from the follow considerations first it be plain that which in this case suggest the idea of greater magnitude must be something which be itself perceive for that which be unperceived can not suggest to our perception any other thing secondly it must be something that do not constantly remain the same but be subject to some change or variation since the appearance of the horizontal moon vary be at one time greater than at another and yet thirdly it can not be the visible figure or magnitude since that remain the same or be rather lesser by how much the moon be nearer to the horizon it remain therefore that the true cause be that affection or alteration of the visible appearance which proceed from the greater paucity of ray arrive at the eye and which i term faintness since this answer all the forementioned condition and i be not conscious of any other perception that doth add to this that in misty weather it be a common observation that the appearance of the horizontal moon be far larger than usual which greatly conspire with and strengthen our opinion neither would it prove in the least irreconcilable with what we have say if the horizontal moon should chance sometimes to seem enlarge beyond its usual extent even in more serene weather for we must not only have regard to the mist which happen to be in the place where we stand we ought also to take into our thoughts the whole sum of vapours and exhalations which lie betwixt the eye and the moon all which cooperate to render the appearance of the moon more faint and thereby increase its magnitude it may chance to appear greater than it usually do even in the horizontal position at a time when though there be no extraordinary fog or haziness just in the place where we stand yet the air between the eye and the moon take all together may be load with a greater quantity of intersperse vapours and exhalations than at other time it may be object that in consequence of our principles the interposition of a body in some degree opaque which may intercept a great part of the ray of light should render the appearance of the moon in the meridian as large as when it be view in the horizon to which i answer it be not faintness anyhow apply that suggest greater magnitude there be no necessary but only an experimental connexion between those two things it follow that the faintness which enlarge the appearance must be apply in such sort and with such circumstances as have be observe to attend the vision of great magnitudes when from a distance we behold great object the particles of the intermediate air and vapours which be themselves unperceivable do interrupt the ray of light and thereby render the appearance less strong and vivid now faintness of appearance cause in this sort hath be experience to coexist with great magnitude but when it be cause by the interposition of an opaque sensible body this circumstance alter the case so that a faint appearance this way cause doth not suggest greater magnitude because it hath not be experience to coexist with it faintness as well as all other ideas or perceptions which suggest magnitude or distance doth it in the same way that word suggest the notions to which they be annex now it be know a word pronounce with certain circumstances or in a certain context with other word hath not always the same import and signification that it hath when pronounce in some other circumstances or different context of word the very same visible appearance as to faintness and all other respect if place on high shall not suggest the same magnitude that it would if it be see at an equal distance on a level with the eye the reason whereof be that we be rarely accustom to view object at a great height our concern lie among things situate rather before than above us and accordingly our eye be not place on the top of our head but in such a position as be most convenient for us to see distant object stand in our way and this situation of them be a circumstance which usually attend the vision of distant object we may from hence account for what be commonly observe an object appear of different magnitude even with respect to its horizontal extension on the top of a steeple for example an hundred feet high to one stand below from what it would if place at an hundred feet distance on a level with his eye for it hath be show that the judgment we make on the magnitude of a thing depend not on the visible appearance alone but also on divers other circumstances any one of which be omit or vary may suffice to make some alteration in our judgment hence the circumstances of view a distant object in such a situation as be usual and suit with the ordinary posture of the head and eye be omit and instead thereof a different situation of the object which require a different posture of the head take place it be not to be wonder at if the magnitude be judge different but it will be demand why an high object should constantly appear less than an equidistant low object of the same dimension for so it be observe to be it may indeed be grant that the variation of some circumstances may vary the judgment make on the magnitude of high object which we be less use to look at but it do not hence appear why they should be judge less rather than greater i answer that in case the magnitude of distant object be suggest by the extent of their visible appearance alone and think proportional thereto it be certain they would then be judge much less than now they seem to be vide sect but several circumstances concur to form the judgment we make on the magnitude of distant object by mean of which they appear far larger than others whose visible appearance hath an equal or even greater extension it follow that upon the change or omission of any of those circumstances which be wont to attend the vision of distant object and so come to influence the judgments make on their magnitude they shall proportionably appear less than otherwise they would for any of those things that cause an object to be think greater than in proportion to its visible extension be either omit or apply without the usual circumstances the judgment depend more entirely on the visible extension and consequently the object must be judge less thus in the present case the situation of the thing see be different from what it usually be in those object we have occasion to view and whose magnitude we observe it follow that the very same object be an hundred feet high should seem less than if it be an hundred feet off on or nearly on a level with the eye what have be here set forth seem to me to have no small share in contribute to magnify the appearance of the horizontal moon and deserve not to be pass over in the explication of it if we attentively consider the phenomenon before us we shall find the not discern between the mediate and immediate object of sight to be the chief cause of the difficulty that occur in the explication of it the magnitude of the visible moon or that which be the proper and immediate object of vision be not greater when the moon be in the horizon than when it be in the meridian how come it therefore to seem greater in one situation than the other what be it can put this cheat on the understand it have no other perception of the moon than what it get by sight and that which be see be of the same extent i say the visible appearance hath the same or rather a less magnitude when the moon be view in the horizontal than when in the meridional position and yet it be esteem greater in the former than in the latter herein consist the difficulty which doth vanish and admit of a most easy solution if we consider that as the visible moon be not greater in the horizon than in the meridian so neither be it think to be so it hath be already show that in any act of vision the visible object absolutely or in itself be little take notice of the mind still carry its view from that to some tangible ideas which have be observe to be connect with it and by that mean come to be suggest by it so that when a thing be say to appear great or small or whatever estimate be make of the magnitude of any thing this be mean not of the visible but of the tangible object this duly consider it will be no hard matter to reconcile the seem contradiction there be that the moon should appear of a different bigness the visible magnitude thereof remain still the same for by sect the very same visible extension with a different faintness shall suggest a different tangible extension when therefore the horizontal moon be say to appear greater than the meridional moon this must be understand not of a greater visible extension but a of greater tangible or real extension which by reason of the more than ordinary faintness of the visible appearance be suggest to the mind along with it many attempt have be make by learn men to account for this appearance gassendus descartes hobbes and several others have employ their thoughts on that subject but how fruitless and unsatisfactory their endeavour have be be sufficiently show in the transactionsphil trans num p where you may see their several opinions at large set forth and confute not without some surprize at the gross blunder that ingenious men have be force into by endeavour to reconcile this appearance with the ordinary principles of optics since the write of which there hath be publish in the transactions numb p another paper relate to the same affair by the celebrate dr wallis wherein he attempt to account for that phenomenon which though it seem not to contain anything new or different from what have be say before by others i shall nevertheless consider in this place his opinion in short be this we judge not of the magnitude of an object by the visual angle alone but by the visual angle in conjunction with the distance hence though the angle remain the same or even become less yet if withal the distance seem to have be increase the object shall appear greater now one way whereby we estimate the distance of anything be by the number and extent of the intermediate object when therefore the moon be see in the horizon the variety of field house etc together with the large prospect of the wide extend land or sea that lie between the eye and the utmost limb of the horizon suggest unto the mind the idea of greater distance and consequently magnify the appearance and this accord to dr wallis be the true account of the extraordinary largeness attribute by the mind to the horizontal moon at a time when the angle subtend by its diameter be not one jot greater than it use to be with reference to this opinion not to repeat what hath be already say concern distance i shall only observe first that if the prospect of interjacent object be that which suggest the idea of farther distance and this idea of farther distance be the cause that bring into the mind the idea of greater magnitude it should hence follow that if one look at the horizontal moon from behind a wall it would appear no bigger than ordinary for in that case the wall interpose cut off all that prospect of sea and land etc which might otherwise increase the apparent distance and thereby the apparent magnitude of the moon nor will it suffice to say the memory doth even then suggest all that extent of land etc which lie within the horizon which suggestion occasion a sudden judgment of sense that the moon be farther off and larger than usual for ask any man who from such a station behold the horizontal moon shall think her greater than usual whether he hath at that time in his mind any idea of the intermediate object or long tract of land that lie between his eye and the extreme edge of the horizon and whether it be that idea which be the cause of his make the aforementioned judgment he will i suppose reply in the negative and declare the horizontal moon shall appear greater than the meridional though he never think of all or any of those things that lie between him and it secondly it seem impossible by this hypothesis to account for the moon appear in the very same situation at one time greater than at another which nevertheless have be show to be very agreeable to the principles we have lay down and receive a most easy and natural explication from them for the further clear up of this point it be to be observe that what we immediately and properly see be only light and colour in sundry situations and shade and degrees of faintness and clearness confusion and distinctness all which visible object be only in the mind nor do they suggest ought external whether distance or magnitude otherwise than by habitual connexion as word do things we be also to remark that beside the strain of the eye and beside the vivid and faint the distinct and confuse appearances which bear some proportion to line and angle have be substitute instead of them in the forego part of this treatise there be other mean which suggest both distance and magnitude particularly the situation of visible point of object as upper or lower the one suggest a farther distance and greater magnitude the other a nearer distance and lesser magnitude all which be an effect only of custom and experience there be really nothing intermediate in the line of distance between the uppermost and lowermost which be both equidistant or rather at no distance from the eye as there be also nothing in upper or lower which by necessary connexion should suggest greater or lesser magnitude now as these customary experimental mean of suggest distance do likewise suggest magnitude so they suggest the one as immediately as the other i say they do not vide sect first suggest distance and then leave the mind from thence to infer or compute magnitude jut suggest magnitude as immediately and directly as they suggest distance this phenomenon of the horizontal moon be a clear instance of the insufficiency of line and angle for explain the way wherein the mind perceive and estimate the magnitude of outward object there be nevertheless a use of computation by them in order to determine the apparent magnitude of things so far as they have a connexion with and be proportional to those other ideas or perceptions which be the true and immediate occasion that suggest to the mind the apparent magnitude of things but this in general may i think be observe concern mathematical computation in optics that it can never be very precise and exact since the judgments we make of the magnitude of external things do often depend on several circumstances which be not proportionable to or capable of be define by line and angle from what have be say we may safely deduce this consequence to wit that a man bear blind and make to see would at first open of his eye make a very different judgment of the magnitude of object intromit by them from what others do he would not consider the ideas of sight with reference to or as have any connexion with the ideas of touch his view of them be entirely terminate within themselves he can no otherwise judge them great or small than as they contain a greater or lesser number of visible point now it be certain that any visible point can cover or exclude from view only one other visible point it follow that whatever object intercept the view of another hath an equal number of visible point with it and consequently they shall both be think by him to have the same magnitude hence it be evident one in those circumstances would judge his thumb with which he might hide a tower or hinder its be see equal to that tower or his hand the interposition whereof might conceal experimental mean the firmament from his view equal to the firmament how great an inequality soever there may in our apprehensions seem to be betwixt those two things because of the customary and close connexion that have grow up in our mind between the object of sight and touch whereby the very different and distinct ideas of those two sense be so blend and confound together as to be mistake for one and the same thing out of which prejudice we can not easily extricate ourselves for the better explain the nature of vision and set the manner wherein we perceive magnitudes in a due light i shall proceed to make some observations concern matter relate thereto whereof the want of reflexion and duly separate between tangible and visible ideas be apt to create in us mistake and confuse notions and first i shall observe that the minimum visibile be exactly equal in all be whatsoever that be endow with the visive faculty no exquisite formation of the eye no peculiar sharpness of sight can make it less in one creature than in another for it not be distinguishable into part nor in any wise a consist of them it must necessarily be the same to all for suppose it otherwise and that the minimum visibile of a mite for instance be less than the minimum visibile of a man the latter therefore may by detraction of some part be make equal to the former it doth therefore consist of part which be inconsistent with the notion of a minimum visibile or point it will perhaps be object that the minimum visibile of a man doth really and in itself contain part whereby it surpass that of a mite though they be not perceivable by the man to which i answer the minimum visibile have in like manner as all other the proper and immediate object of sight be show not to have any existence without the mind of him who see it it follow there can not be any pan of it that be not actually perceive and therefore visible now for any object to contain distinct visible part and at the same time to be a minimum visibile be a manifest contradiction of these visible point we see at all time an equal number it be every whit as great when our view be contract and bound by near object as when it be extend to larger and remoter for it be impossible that one minimum visibile should obscure or keep out of sight mote than one other it be a plain consequence that when my view be on all side bound by the wall of my study see just as many visible point as i could in case that by the removal of the studywalls and all other obstructions i have a full prospect of the circumjacent field mountains sea and open firmament for so long as i be shut up within the wall by their interposition every point of the external object be cover from my view but each point that be see be able to cover or exclude from sight one only other correspond point it follow that whilst my sight be confine to those narrow wall i see as many point or minima visibilia as i should be those wall away by look on all the external object whose prospect be intercept by them whenever therefore we be say to have a greater prospect at one time than another this must be understand with relation not to the proper and immediate but the secondary and mediate object of vision which as hath be show properly belong to the touch the visive faculty consider with reference to its immediate object may be find to labour of two defect first in respect of the extent or number of visible point that be at once perceivable by it which be narrow and limit to a certain degree it can take in at one view but a certain determinate number of minima visibilia beyond which it can not extend its prospect secondly our sight be defective in that its view be not only narrow but also for the most part confuse of those things that we take in at one prospect we can see but a few at once clearly and unconfusedly and the more we fix our sight on any one object by so much the darker and more indistinct shall the rest appear correspond to these two defect of sight we may imagine as many perfections to wit st that of comprehend in one view a greater number of visible point dly of be able to view them all equally and at once with the utmost clearness and distinction that those perfections be not actually in some intelligences of a different order and capacity from ours it be impossible for us to know in neither of those two ways do microscopes contribute to the improvement of sight for when we look through a microscope we neither see more visible point nor be the collateral point more distinct than when we look with the naked eye at object place in a due distance a microscope bring us as it be into a new world it present us with a new scene of visible object quite different from what we behold with the naked eye but herein consist the most remarkable difference to wit that whereas the object perceive by the eye alone have a certain connexion with tangible object whereby we be teach to foresee what will ensue upon the approach or application of distant object to the part of our own body which much conduceth to its preservation there be not the like connexion between things tangible and those visible object that be perceive by help of a fine microscope hence it be evident that be our eye turn into the nature of microscopes we should not be much benefit by the change we should be deprive of the forementioned advantage we at present receive by the visive faculty and have leave us only the empty amusement of see without any other benefit arise from it but in that case it will perhaps be say our sight would be endue with a far greater sharpness and penetration than it now hath but it be certain from what we have already show that the minimum visibile be never greater or lesser but in all case constantly the same and in the case of microscopical eye i see only this difference to wit that upon the cease of a certain observable connexion betwixt the divers perceptions of sight and touch which before enable us to regulate our action by the eye it would now be render utterly unserviceable to that purpose upon the whole it seem that if we consider the use and end of sight together with the present state and circumstances of our be we shall not find any great cause to complain of any defect or imperfection in it or easily conceive how it could be mend with such admirable wisdom be that faculty contrive both for the pleasure and convenience of life have finish what i intend to say concern the distance and magnitude of object i come now to treat of the manner wherein the mind perceive by sight their situation among the discoveries of the last age it be repute none of the least that the manner of vision hath be more clearly explain than ever it have be before there be at this day no one ignorant that the picture of external object be paint on the retina or fund of the eye that we can see nothing which be not so paint and that accord as the picture be more distinct or confuse so also be the perception we have of the object but then in this explication of vision there occur one mighty difficulty the object be paint in an invert order on the bottom of the eye the upper part of any object be paint on the lower part of the eye and the lower part of the object on the upper part of the eye and so also as to right and leave since therefore the picture be thus invert it be demand how it come to pass that we see the object erect and in their natural posture in answer to this difficulty we be tell that the mind perceive an impulse of a ray of light on the upper part of the eye consider this ray as come in a direct line from the lower part of the object and in like manner trace the ray that strike on the lower part of the eye it be direct to the upper part of the object thus in the adjacent figure c the lower point of the object abc be project on c the upper part of the eye so likewise the highest point a be project on a the lowest part of the eye which make the representation cba invert but the mind consider the stroke that be make on c as come in the straight line cc from the lower end of the object and the stroke or impulse on a as come in the line aa from the upper end of the object be direct to make a right judgment of the situation of the object abc notwithstanding the picture of it be invert this be illustrate by conceive a blind man who hold in his hand two stick that cross each other doth with them touch the extremities of an object place in a perpendicular situation it be certain this man will judge that to be the upper part of the object which he touch with the stick hold in the undermost hand and that to be the lower part of the object which he touch with the stick in his uppermost hand this be the common explication of the erect appearance of object which be generally receive and acquiesce in be as mr molyneux tell us diopt par c p allow by all men as satisfactory but this account to me do not seem in any degree true do i perceive those impulses decussations and directions of the ray of light in like manner as hath be set forth then indeed it would not be altogether void of probability and there might be some pretence for the comparison of the blind man and his cross stick but the case be far otherwise i know very well that i perceive no such thing and of consequence i can not thereby make an estimate of the situation of object i appeal to anyones experience whether he be conscious to himself that he think on the intersection make by the radious sic pencil or pursue the impulses they give in right line whenever he perceive by sight the position of any object to me it seem evident that cross and trace of the ray be never think on by children idiots or in truth by any other save only those who have apply themselves to the study of optics and for the mind to judge of the situation of object by those things without perceive them or to perceive them without know it be equally beyond my comprehension add to this that the explain the manner of vision by the example of cross stick and hunt for the object along the ax of the radious pencil doth suppose the proper object of sight to be perceive at a distance from us contrary to what hath be demonstrate it remain therefore that we look for some other explication of this difficulty and i believe it not impossible to find one provide we examine it to the bottom and carefully distinguish between the ideas of sight and touch which can not be too oft inculcate in treat of vision but more especially throughout the consideration of this affair we ought to carry that distinction in our thoughts for that from want of a right understand thereof the difficulty of explain erect vision seem chiefly to arise in order to disentangle our mind from whatever prejudice we may entertain with relation to the subject in hand nothing seem more apposite than the take into our thoughts the case of one bear blind and afterwards when grow up make to see and though perhaps it may not be an easy task to divest ourselves entirely of the experience receive from sight so as to be able to put our thoughts exactly in the posture of such a ones we must nevertheless as far as possible endeavour to frame true conceptions of what might reasonably be suppose to pass in his mind it be certain that a man actually blind and who have continue so from his birth would by the sense of feel attain to have ideas of upper and lower by the motion of his hand he might discern the situation of any tangible object place within his fi reach that part on which he felt himself support or towards which he perceive his body to gravitate he would term lower and the contrary to this upper and accordingly denominate whatsoever object he touch but then whatever judgments he make concern the situation of object be confine to those only that be perceivable by touch all those things that be intangible and of a spiritual nature his thoughts and desire his passions and in general all the modifications of the soul to these he would never apply the term upper and lower except only in a metaphorical sense he may perhaps by way of allusion speak of high or low thoughts but those term in their proper signification would never be apply to anything that be not conceive to exist without the mind for a man bear blind and remain in the same state could mean nothing else by the word higher and lower than a greater or lesser distance from the earth which distance he would measure by the motion or application of his hand or some other part of his body it be therefore evident that all those things which in respect of each other would by him be think higher or lower must be such as be conceive to exist without his mind in the ambient space whence it plainly follow that such a one if we suppose him make to see would not at first sight think anything he saw be high or low erect or invert for it hath be already demonstrate in sect that he would not think the things he perceive by sight to be at any distance from him or without his mind the object to which he have hitherto be use to apply the term up and down high and low be such only as affect or be some way perceive by his couch but the proper object of vision make a new set of ideas perfectly distinct and different from the former and which can in no sort make themselves perceive by touch there be therefore nothing at all that could induce him to think those term applicable to them nor would he ever think it till such time as he have observe their connexion with tangible object and the same prejudice begin to insinuate itself into his understand which from their infancy have grow up in the understand of other men to set this matter in a clearer light i shall make use of an example suppose the abovementioned blind person by his touch perceive a man to stand erect let us inquire into the manner of this by the application of his hand to the several part of a human body he have perceive different tangible ideas which be collect into sundry complex ones have distinct name annex to them thus one combination of a certain tangible figure bulk and consistency of part be call the head another the hand a third the foot and so of the rest all which complex ideas could in his understand be make up only of ideas perceivable by touch he have also by his touch obtain an idea of earth or grind towards which he perceive the part of his body to have a natural tendency now by erect nothing more be mean than that perpendicular position of a man wherein his feet be nearest to the earth if the blind person by move his hand over the part of the man who stand before him perceive the tangible ideas that compose the head to be farthest from and those that compose the feet to be nearest to that other combination of tangible ideas which he call earth he will denominate that man erect but if we suppose him on a sudden to receive his sight and that he behold a man stand before him it be evident in that case he would neither judge the man he see to be erect nor invert for he never have know those term apply to any other save tangible things or which exist in the space without him and what he see neither be tangible nor perceive as exist without he could not know that in propriety of language they be applicable to it afterwards when upon turn his head or eye up and down to the right and leave he shall observe the visible object to change and shall also attain to know that they be call by the same name and connect with the object perceive by touch then indeed he will come to speak of them and their situation in the same term that he have be use to apply to tangible things and those that he perceive by turn up his eye he will call upper and those that by turn down his eye he will call lower and this seem to me the true reason why he should think those object uppermost that be paint on the lower part of his eye for by turn the eye up they shall be distinctly see as likewise those that be paint on the highest part of the eye shall be distinctly see by turn the eye down and be for that reason esteem lowest for we have show that to the immediate object of sight consider in themselves he would not attribute the term high and low it must therefore be on account of some circumstances which be observe to attend them and these it be plain be the action of turn the eye up and down which suggest a very obvious reason why the mind should denominate the object of sight accordingly high or low and without this motion of the eye this turn it up and down in order to discern different object doubtless erect inverse and other the like term relate to the position of tangible object would never have be transfer or in any degree apprehend to belong to the ideas of sight the mere act of see include nothing in it to that purpose whereas the different situations of the eye naturally direct the mind to make a suitable judgment of the situation of object intromit by it farther when he have by experience learn the connexion there be between the several ideas of sight and touch he will be able by the perception he have of the situation of visible things in respect of one another to make a sudden and true estimate of the situation of outward tangible things correspond to them and thus it be he shall perceive by sight the situation of external object which do not properly fall under that sense i know we be very prone to think that if just make to see we should judge of the situation of visible things as we do now but we be also as prone to think that at first sight we should in the same way apprehend the distance and magnitude of object as we do now which hath be show to be a false and groundless persuasion and for the like reason the same censure may be pass on the positive assurance that most men before they have think sufficiently of the matter might have of their be able to determine by the eye at first view whether object be erect or inverse it will perhaps be object co our opinion that a man for instance be think erect when his feet be next the earth and invert when his head be next the earth it doth hence follow that by the mere act of vision without any experience or alter the situation of the eye we should have determine whether he be erect or invert for both the earth itself and the limbs of the man who stand thereon be equally perceive by sight one can not choose see what part of the man be nearest the earth and what part farthest from it ie whether he be erect or invert to which i answer the ideas which constitute the tangible earth and man be entirely different from those which constitute the visible earth and man nor be it possible by virtue of the visive faculty alone without superadding any experience of touch or alter the position of the eye ever to have know or so much as suspect there have be any relation or connexion between them hence a man at first view would not denominate anything he saw earth or head or foot and consequently he could not tell by the mere act of vision whether the head or feet be nearest the earth nor indeed would we have thereby any think of earth or man erect or inverse at all which will be make yet more evident if we nicely observe and make a particular comparison between the ideas of both sense that which i see be only variety of light and colour that which i feel be hard or soft hot or cold rough or smooth what similitude what connexion have those ideas with these or how be it possible that anyone should see reason to give one and the same name to combinations of ideas so very different before he have experience their coexistence we do not find there be any necessary connexion betwixt this or that tangible quality and any colour whatsoever and we may sometimes perceive colour where there be nothing to be felt all which doth make it manifest that no man at first receive of his sight would know there be any agreement between this or that particular object of his sight and any object of touch he have be already acquaint with the colour therefore of the head would to him no more suggest the idea of head than they would the idea of foot farther we have at large show vid sect and there be no discoverable necessary connexion between any give visible magnitude and any one particular tangible magnitude but that it be entirely the result of custom and experience and depend on foreign and accidental circumstances that we can by the perception of visible extension inform ourselves what may be the extension of any tangible object connect with it hence it be certain that neither the visible magnitude of head or foot would bring along with them into the mind at first open of the eye the respective tangible magnitudes of those part by the forego section it be plain the visible figure of any part of the body hath no necessary connexion with the tangible figure thereof so as at first sight to suggest it to the mind for figure be the termination of magnitude whence it follow that no visible magnitude have in its own nature an aptness to suggest any one particular tangible magnitude so neither can any visible figure be inseparably connect with its correspond tangible figure so as of itself and in a way prior to experience it might suggest it to the understand this will be farther evident if we consider that what seem smooth and round to the touch may to sight if view through a microscope seem quite otherwise from all which lay together and duly consider we may clearly deduce this inference in the first act of vision no idea enter by the eye would have a perceivable connexion with the ideas to which the name earth man head foot etc be annex in the understand of a person blind from his birth so as in any sort to introduce them into his mind or make themselves be call by the same name and repute the same things with them as afterwards they come to be there doth nevertheless remain one difficulty which perhaps may seem to press hard on our opinion and deserve not to be pass over for though it be grant that neither the colour size nor figure of the visible feet have any necessary connexion with the ideas that compose the tangible feet so as to bring them at first sight into my mind or make me in danger of confound them before i have be use to and for some time experience their connexion yet thus much seem undeniable namely that the number of the visible feet be the same with that of the tangible feet i may from hence without any experience of sight reasonably conclude that they represent or be connect with the feet rather than the head i say it seem the idea of two visible feet will sooner suggest to the mind the idea of two tangible feet than of one head so that the blind man upon first reception of the visive faculty might know which be the feet or two and which the head or one in order to get clear of this seem difficulty we need only observe that diversity of visible object doth not necessarily infer diversity of tangible object correspond to them a picture paint with great variety of colour affect the touch in one uniform manner it be therefore evident that i do not by any necessary consecution independent of experience judge of the number of things tangible from the number of things visible i should not therefore at first open my eye conclude that because i see two i shall feel two how therefore can i before experience teach me know that the visible legs because two be connect with the tangible legs or the visible head because one be connect with the tangible head the truth be the things i see be so very different and heterogeneous from the things i feel that the perception of the one would never have suggest the other to my thoughts or enable me to pass the least judgment thereon until i have experience their connexion but for a fuller illustration of this matter it ought to be consider that number however some may reckon it amongst the primary qualities be nothing fix and settle really exist in things themselves it be entirely the creature of the mind consider either an idea by itself or any combination of ideas to which it give one name and so make it pass for an unit accord as the mind variously combine its ideas the unit vary and as the unit so the number which be only a collection of units doth also vary we call a window one a chimney one and yet a house in which there be many windows and many chimneys hath an equal right to be call one and many house go to the make of the city in these and the like instance it be evident the unit constantly relate to the particular draught the mind make of its ideas to which it affix name and wherein it include more or less as best suit its own end and purpose whatever therefore the mind consider as one that be an unit every combination of ideas be consider as one thing by the mind and in token thereof be mark by one name now this name and combine together of ideas be perfectly arbitrary and do by the mind in such sort as experience show it to be most convenient without which our ideas have never be collect into such sundry distinct combinations as they now be hence it follow that a man bear blind and afterwards when grow up make to see would not in the first act of vision parcel out the ideas of sight into the same distinct collections that others do who have experience which do regularly coexist and be proper to be bundle up together under one name he would not for example make into one complex idea and thereby esteem an unit all those particular ideas which constitute the visible head or foot for there can be no reason assign why he should do so barely upon his see a man stand upright before him there crowd into his mind the ideas which compose the visible man in company with all the other ideas of sight perceive at the same time but all these ideas offer at once to his view he would not distribute into sundry distinct combinations till such time as by observe the motion of the part of the man and other experience he come to know which be to be separate and which to be collect together from what hath be premise it be plain the object of sight and touch make if i may so say two set of ideas which be widely different from each other to object of either kind we indifferently attribute the term high and low right and leave and suchlike denote the position or situation of things but then we must well observe that the position of any object be determine with respect only to object of the same sense we say any object of touch be high or low accord as it be more or less distant from the tangible earth and in like manner we denominate any object of sight high or low in proportion as it be more or less distant from the visible earth but to define the situation of visible things with relation to the distance they bear from any tangible thing or vice versa this be absurd and perfectly unintelligible for all visible things be equally in the mind and take up no part of the external space and consequently be equidistant from any tangible thing which exist without the mind or rather to speak truly the proper object of sight be at no distance neither near nor far from any tangible thing for if we inquire narrowly into the matter we shall find that those things only be compare together in respect of distance which exist after the same manner or appertain unto the same sense for by the distance between any two point nothing more be mean than the number of intermediate point if the give point be visible the distance between them be mark out by the number of the interjacent visible point if they be tangible the distance between them be a line consist of tangible point but if they be one tangible and the other visible the distance between them doth neither consist of point perceivable by sight nor by touch ie it be utterly inconceivable this perhaps will not find an easy admission into all mens understand however i should gladly be inform whether it be not true by anyone who will be at the pain to reflect a little and apply it home to his thoughts the not observe what have be deliver in the two last section seem to have occasion no small part of the difficulty that occur in the business of erect appearances the head which be paint nearest the earth seem to be farthest from it and on the other hand the feet which be paint farthest from the earth be think nearest to it herein lie the difficulty which vanish if we express the thing more clearly and free from ambiguity thus how come it that to the eye the visible head which be nearest the tangible earth seem farthest from the earth and the visible feet which be farthest from the tangible earth seem nearest the earth the question be thus propose who see not the difficulty be found on a supposition that the eye or visive faculty or rather the soul by mean thereof should judge of the situation of visible object with reference to their distance from the tangible earth whereas it be evident the tangible earth be not perceive by sight and it hath be show in the two last precede section that the location of visible object be determine only by the distance they bear from one another and that it be nonsense to talk of distance far or near between a visible and tangible thing if we confine our thoughts to the proper object of sight the whole be plain and easy the head be paint farthest from and the feet nearest to the visible earth and so they appear to be what be there strange or unaccountable in this let us suppose the picture in the fund of the eye to be the immediate object of the sight the consequence be that things should appear in the same posture they be paint in and be it not so the head which be see seem farthest from the earth which be see and the feet which be see seem nearest to the earth which be see and just so they be paint but say you the picture of the man be invert and yet the appearance be erect i ask what mean you by the picture of the man or which be the same thing the visible man be invert you tell me it be invert because the heel be uppermost and the head undermost explain me this you say that by the head be undermost you mean that it be nearest to the earth and by the heel be uppermost that they be farthest from the earth i ask again what earth you mean you can not mean the earth that be paint on the eye or the visible earth for the picture of the head be farthest from the picture of the earth and the picture of the feet nearest to the picture of the earth and accordingly the visible head be farthest from the visible earth and the visible feet nearest to it it remain therefore that you mean the tangible earth and so determine the situation of visible things with respect to tangible things contrary to what hath be demonstrate in sect and the two distinct provinces of sight and touch should be consider apart and as if their object have no intercourse no manner of relation one to another in point of distance or position farther what greatly contribute to make us mistake in this matter be that when we think of the picture in the fund of the eye we imagine ourselves look on the fund of anothers eye or another look on the fund of our own eye and behold the picture paint thereon suppose two eye a and b a from some distance look on the picture in b see them invert and for that reason conclude they be invert in b but this be wrong there be project in little on the bottom of a the image of the picture of suppose man earth etc which be paint on b and besides these the eye b itself and the object which environ it together with another earth be project in a larger size on a now by the eye a these larger image be deem the true object and the lesser only picture in miniature and it be with respect to those greater image that it determine the situation of the smaller image so that compare the little man with the great earth a judge him invert or that the feet be farthest from and the head nearest to the great earth whereas if a compare the little man with the little earth then he will appear erect ie his head shall seem farthest from and his feet nearest to the little earth but we must consider that b do not see two earth as a do it see only what be represent by the little picture in a and consequently shall judge the man erect for in truth the man in b be not invert for there the feet be next the earth but it be the representation of it in a which be invert for there the head of the representation of the picture of the man in b be next the earth and the feet farthest from the earth mean the earth which be without the representation of the picture in b for if you take the little image of the picture in b and consider them by themselves and with respect only to one another they be all erect and in their natural posture farther there lie a mistake in our imagine that the picture of external object be paint on the bottom of the eye it hath be show there be no resemblance between the ideas of sight and things tangible it hath likewise be demonstrate that the proper object of sight do not exist without the mind whence it clearly follow that the picture paint on the bottom of the eye be not the picture of external object let anyone consult his own thoughts and then say what affinity what liken there be between that certain variety and disposition of colour which constitute the visible man or picture of a man and that other combination of far different ideas sensible by touch which compose the tangible man but if this be the case how come they to be account picture or image since that suppose them to copy or represent some originals or other to which i answer in the forementioned instance the eye a take the little image include within the representation of the other eye b to be picture or copy whereof the archetypes be not things exist without but the larger picture project on its own fund and which by a be not think picture but the originals or true things themselves though if we suppose a third eye c from a due distance to behold the fund of a then indeed the things project thereon shall to c seem picture or image in the same sense that those project on b do to a rightly to conceive this point we must carefully distinguish between the ideas of sight and touch between the visible and tangible eye for certainly on the tangible eye nothing either be or seem to be paint again the visible eye as well as all other visible object hath be show to exist only in the mind which perceive its own ideas and compare them together call some picture in respect of others what hath be say be rightly comprehend and lay together doth i think afford a full and genuine explication of the erect appearance of object which phenomenon i must confess i do not see how it can be explain by any theories of vision hitherto make public in treat of these things the use of language be apt to occasion some obscurity and confusion and create in us wrong ideas for language be accommodate to the common notions and prejudice of men it be scarce possible to deliver the naked and precise truth without great circumlocution impropriety and to an unwary reader seem contradictions i do therefore once for all desire whoever shall think it worth his while to understand what i have write concern vision that he would not stick in this or that phrase or manner of expression but candidly collect my mean from the whole sum and tenor of my discourse and lay aside the word as much as possible consider the bare notions themselves and then judge whether they be agreeable to truth and his own experience or no we have show the way wherein the mind by mediation of visible ideas doth perceive or apprehend the distance magnitude and situation of tangible object we come now to inquire more particularly concern the difference between the ideas of sight and touch which be call by the same name and see whether there be any idea common to both sense from what we have at large set forth and demonstrate in the forego part of this treatise it be plain there be no one selfsame numerical extension perceive both by sight and touch but that the particular figure and extensions perceive by sight however they may be call by the same name and repute the same things with those perceive by touch be nevertheless different and have an existence distinct and separate from them so that the question be not now concern the same numerical ideas but whether there be any one and the same sort of species of ideas equally perceivable to both sense or in other word whether extension figure and motion perceive by sight be not specifically distinct from extension figure and motion perceive by touch but before i come more particularly to discuss this matter i find it proper to consider extension in abstract for of this there be much talk and i be apt to think that when men speak of extension as be an idea common to two sense it be with a secret supposition that we can single out extension from all other tangible and visible qualities and form thereof an abstract idea which idea they will have common both to sight and touch we be therefore to understand by extension in abstract an idea of extension for instance a line or surface entirely strip of all other sensible qualities and circumstances that might determine it to any particular existence it be neither black nor white nor red nor hath it any colour at all or any tangible quality whatsoever and consequently it be of no finite determinate magnitude for that which bound or distinguish one extension from another be some quality or circumstance wherein they disagree now i do not find that i can perceive imagine or any wise frame in my mind such an abstract idea as be here speak of a line or surface which be neither black nor white nor blue nor yellow etc nor long nor short nor rough nor smooth nor square nor round etc be perfectly incomprehensible this i be sure of as to myself how far the faculties of other men may reach they best can tell it be commonly say that the object of geometry be abstract extension but geometry contemplate figure now figure be the termination of magnitude but we have show that extension in abstract hath no finite determinate magnitude whence it clearly follow that it can have no figure and consequently be not the object of geometry it be indeed a tenet as well of the modern as of the ancient philosophers that all general truths be concern universal abstract ideas without which we be tell there could be no science no demonstration of any general proposition in geometry but it be no hard matter do i think it necessary to my present purpose to show that proposition and demonstrations in geometry might be universal though they who make them never think of abstract general ideas of triangles or circle after reiterate endeavour to apprehend the general idea a triangle i have find it altogether incomprehensible and surely if anyone be able to introduce that idea into my mind it must be the author of the essay concern human understand he who have so far distinguish himself from the generality of writers by the clearness and significancy of what he say let us therefore see how this celebrate author describe the general or abstract idea of a triangle it must be say he neither oblique nor rectangular neither equilateral equicrural nor scalenum but all and none of these at once in effect it be somewhat imperfect that can not exist an idea wherein some part of several different and inconsistent ideas be put together essay on hum understand b iv c s this be the idea which he think needful for the enlargement of knowledge which be the subject of mathematical demonstration and without which we could never come to know any general proposition concern triangles that author acknowledge it doth require some pain and skill to form this general idea of a triangle ibid but have he call to mind what he say in another place to wit that ideas of mix modes wherein any inconsistent ideas be put together can not so much as exist in the mind ie be conceive vid b iii c s ibid i say have this occur to his thoughts it be not improbable he would have own it above all the pain and skill he be master of to form the abovementioned idea of a triangle which be make up of manifest star contradictions that a man who lay so great a stress on clear and determinate ideas should nevertheless talk at this rate seem very surprise but the wonder will lessen if it be consider that the source whence this opinion flow be the prolific womb which have bring forth innumerable errors and difficulties in all part of philosophy and in all the sciences but this matter take in its full extent be a subject too comprehensive to be insist on in this place and so much for extension in abstract some perhaps may think pure space vacuum or trine dimension to be equally the object of sight and touch but though we have a very great propension to think the ideas of outness and space to be the immediate object of sight yet if i mistake not in the forego part of this essay that hath be clearly demonstrate to be a mere delusion arise from the quick and sudden suggestion of fancy which so closely connect the idea of distance with those of sight that we be apt to think it be itself a proper and immediate object of that sense till reason correct the mistake it have be show that there be no abstract ideas of figure and that it be impossible for us by any precision of think to frame an idea of extension separate from all other visible and tangible qualities which shall be common both to sight and touch the question now remain be whether the particular extensions figure and motion perceive by sight be of the same kind with the particular extensions figure and motion perceive by touch in answer to which i shall venture to lay down the follow proposition the extension figure and motion perceive by sight be specifically distinct from the ideas of touch call by the same name nor be there any such thing as one idea or kind of idea common to both sense this proposition may without much difficulty be collect from what hath be say in several place of this essay but because it seem so remote from and contrary to the receive notions and settle opinion of mankind i shall attempt to demonstrate it more particularly and at large by the follow arguments when upon perception of an idea i range it under this or that sort it be because it be perceive after the same manner or because it have a liken or conformity with or affect me in the same way as the ideas of the sort i rank it under in short it must not be entirely new but have something in it old and already perceive by me it must i say have so much at least in common with the ideas i have before know and name as to make me give it the same name with them but it have be if i mistake not clearly make out that a man bear blind would not at first reception of his sight think the things he saw be of the same nature with the object of touch or have anything in common with them but that they be a new set of ideas perceive in a new manner and entirely different from all he have ever perceive before so that he would not call them by the same name nor repute them to be of the same sort with anything he have hitherto know secondly light and colour be allow by all to constitute a son or species entirely different from the ideas of touch nor will any man i presume say they can make themselves perceive by that sense but there be no other immediate object of sight besides light and colour it be therefore a direct consequence that there be no idea common to both sense it be a prevail opinion even amongst those who have think and writ most accurately concern our ideas and the ways whereby they enter into the understand that something more be perceive by sight than barely light and colour with their variations mr locke termeth sight the most comprehensive of all our sense convey to our mind the ideas of light and colour which be peculiar only to that sense and also the far different ideas of space figure and motion essay on human understand b ii c s space or distance we have show be not otherwise the object of sight than of hear vid sect and as for figure and extension i leave it to anyone that shall calmly attend to his own clear and distinct ideas to decide whether he have any idea intromit immediately and properly by sight save only light and colour or whether it de possible for him to frame in his mind a distinct abstract idea of visible extension or figure exclusive of all colour and on the other hand whether he can conceive colour without visible extension for my own part i must confess i be not able to attain so great a nicety of abstraction in a strict sense i see nothing but light and colour with their several shade and variations he who beside these doth also perceive by sight ideas far different and distinct from them hath that faculty in a degree more perfect and comprehensive than i can pretend to it must be own that by the mediation of light and colour other far different ideas be suggest to my mind but so they be by hear which beside sound which be peculiar to that sense doth by their mediation suggest not only space figure and motion but also all other ideas whatsoever that can be signify by word thirdly it be i think an axiom universally receive that quantities of the same kind may be add together and make one entire sum mathematicians add line together but they do not add a line to a solid or conceive it as make one sum with a surface these three kinds of quantity be think incapable of any such mutual addition and consequently of be compare together in the several ways of proportion be by then esteem entirely disparate and heterogeneous now let anyone try in his thoughts to add a visible line or surface to a tangible line or surface so as to conceive them make one continue sum or whole he that can do this may think them homogeneous but he that can not must by the forego axiom think them heterogeneous a blue and a red line i can conceive add together into one sum and make one continue line but to make in my thoughts one continue line of a visible and tangible line add together be i find a task far more difficult and even insurmountable and i leave it to the reflexion and experience of every particular person to determine for himself a farther confirmation of our tenet may be draw from the solution of mr molyneuxs problem publish by mr locke in his essay which i shall set down as it there lie together with mr lock opinion of it suppose a man bear blind and now adult and teach by his touch to distinguish between a cube and a sphere of the same metal and nighly sic of the same bigness so as to tell when he felt one and tother which be the cube and which the sphere suppose then the cube and sphere place on a table and the blind man to be make to see quaere whether by his sight before he touch them he could now distinguish and tell which be the globe which the cube to which the acute and judicious proposer answer not for though he have obtain the experience of how a globe how a cube affect his touch yet he have not yet attain the experience that what affect his touch so or so must affect his sight so or so or that a protuberant angle in the cube that press his hand unequally shall appear to his eye as it doth in the cube i agree with this think gentleman whom i be proud to call my friend in his answer to this his problem and be of opinion that the blind man at first sight would not be able with certainty to say which be the globe which the cube whilst he only saw them essay on human understand b ii c s now if a square surface perceive by touch be of the same sort with a square surface perceive by sight it be certain the blind man here mention might know a square surface as soon as he saw it it be no more but introduce into his mind by a new inlet an idea he have be already well acquaint with since therefore he be suppose to have know by his touch that a cube be a body terminate by square surface and that a sphere be not terminate by square surface upon the supposition that a visible and tangible square differ only in numero it follow that he might know by the unerring mark of the square surface which be the cube and which not while he only saw them we must therefore allow either that visible extension and figure be specifically distinct from tangible extension and figure or else that the solution of this problem give by those two thoughtful and ingenious men be wrong much more might be lay together in proof of the proposition i have advance but what have be say be if i mistake not sufficient to convince anyone that shall yield a reasonable attention and as for those that will not be at the pain of a little think no multiplication of word will ever suffice to make them understand the truth or rightly conceive my mean i can not let go the abovementioned problem without some reflexion on it it hath be evident that a man blind from his birth would not at first sight denominate anything he saw by the name he have be use to appropriate to ideas of touch vid sect cube sphere table be word he have know apply to things perceivable by touch but to things perfectly intangible he never know them apply those word in their wonted application always mark out to his mind body or solid things which be perceive by the resistance they give but there be no solidity no resistance or protrusion perceive by sight in short the ideas of sight be all new perceptions to which there be no name annex in his mind he can not therefore understand what be say to him concern them and to ask of the two body he saw place on the table which be the sphere which the cube be to him a question downright banter and unintelligible nothing he see be able to suggest to his thoughts the idea of body distance or in general of anything he have already know it be a mistake to think the same thing affect both sight and touch if the same angle or square which be the object of touch be also the object of vision what should hinder the blind man at first sight from know it for though the manner wherein it affect the sight be different from that wherein it affect his touch yet there be beside his manner or circumstance which be new and unknown the angle or figure which be old and know he can not choose but discern it visible figure and extension have be demonstrate to be of a nature entirely different and heterogeneous from tangible figure and extension it remain that we inquire concern now that visible motion be not of the same sort with tangible motion seem to need no farther proof it be an evident corollary from what we have show concern the difference there be between visible and tangible extension but for a more full and express proof hereof we need only observe that one who have not yet experience vision would not at first sight know motion whence it clearly follow that motion perceivable by sight be of a sort distinct from motion perceivable by touch the antecedent i prove thus by touch he could not perceive any motion but what be up or down to the right or leave nearer or farther from him besides these and their several varieties or complications it be impossible he should have any idea of motion he would not therefore think anything to be motion or give the name motion to any idea which he could not range under some or other of those particular kinds thereof but from sect it be plain that by the mere act of vision he could not know motion upwards or downwards to the right or leave or in any other possible direction from which i conclude he would not know motion at all at first sight as for the idea of motion in abstract i shall not waste paper about it but leave it to my reader to make the best he can of it to me it be perfectly unintelligible the consideration of motion may furnish a new field for inquiry but since the manner wherein the mind apprehend by sight the motion of tangible object with the various degrees thereof may be easily collect from what hath be say concern the manner wherein that sense doth suggest their various distance magnitudes and situations i shall not enlarge any farther on this subject but proceed to consider what may be allege with greatest appearance of reason against the proposition we have show to be true for where there be so much prejudice to be encounter a bare and naked demonstration of the truth will scarce suffice we must also satisfy the scruple that men may raise in favour of their preconceive notions show whence the mistake arise how it come to spread and carefully disclose and root out those false persuasions that an early prejudice might have implant in the mind first therefore it will be demand how visible extension and figure come to be call by the same name with tangible extension and figure if they be not of the same kind with them it must be something more than humour or accident that could occasion a custom so constant and universal as this which have obtain in all age and nations of the world and amongst all rank of men the learn as well as the illiterate to which i answer we can no more argue a visible and tangible square to be of the same species from their be call by the same name than we can that a tangible square and the monosyllable consist of six letter whereby it be mark be of the same species because they be both call by the same name it be customary to call write word and the things they signify by the same name for word not be regard in their own nature or otherwise than as they be mark of things it have be superfluous and beside the design of language to have give them name distinct from those of the things mark by them the same reason hold here also visible figure be the mark of tangible figure and from sect it be plain that in themselves they be little regard or upon any other score than for their connexion with tangible figure which by nature they be ordain to signify and because this language of nature doth not vary in different age or nations hence it be that in all time and place visible figure be call by the same name as the respective tangible figure suggest by them and not because they be alike or of the same sort with them but say you surely a tangible square be liker to a visible square than to a visible circle it have four angle and as many side so also have the visible square but the visible circle have no such thing be bound by one uniform curve without right line or angle which make it unfit to represent the tangible square but very fit to represent the tangible circle whence it clearly follow that visible figure be pattern of or of the same species with the respective tangible figure represent by them that they be like unto them and of their own nature fit to represent them as be of the same sort and that they be in no respect arbitrary sign as word i answer it must be acknowledge the visible square be fitter than the visible circle to represent the tangible square but then it be not because it be liker or more of a species with it but because the visible square contain in it several distinct part whereby to mark the several distinct correspond part of a tangible square whereas the visible circle doth not the square perceive by touch hath four distinct equal side so also hath it four distinct equal angle it be therefore necessary that the visible figure which shall be most proper to mark it contain four distinct equal part correspond to the four side of the tangible square as likewise four other distinct and equal part whereby to denote the four equal angle of the tangible square and accordingly we see the visible figure contain in them distinct visible part answer to the distinct tangible part of the figure signify or suggest by them but it will not hence follow that any visible figure be like unto or of the same species with its correspond tangible figure unless it be also show that not only the number but also the kind of the part be the same in both to illustrate this i observe that visible figure represent tangible figure much after the same manner that write word do sound now in this respect word be not arbitrary it not be indifferent what write word stand for any sound but it be requisite that each word contain in it so many distinct character as there be variations in the sound it stand for thus the single letter a be proper to mark one simple uniform sound and the word adultery be accommodate to represent the sound annex to it in the formation whereof there be eight different collisions or modifications of the air by the organs of speech each of which produce a difference of sound it be fit the word represent it should consist of as many distinct character thereby to mark each particular difference or part of the whole sound and yet nobody i presume will say the single letter a or the word adultery be like unto or of the same species with the respective sound by them represent it be indeed arbitrary that in general letter of any language represent sound at all but when that be once agree it be not arbitrary what combination of letter shall represent this or that particular sound i leave this with the reader to pursue and apply it in his own thoughts it must be confess that we be not so apt to confound other sign with the things signify or to think them of the same species as we be visible and tangible ideas but a little consideration will show us how this may be without our suppose them of a like nature these sign be constant and universal their connexion with tangible ideas have be learn at our first entrance into the world and ever since almost every moment of our live it have be occur to our thoughts and fasten and strike deeper on our mind when we observe that sign be variable and of human institution when we remember there be a time they be not connect in our mind with those things they now so readily suggest but that their signification be learn by the slow step of experience this preserve us from confound them but when we find the same sign suggest the same things all over the world when we know they be not of human institution and can not remember that we ever learn their signification but think that at first sight they would have suggest to us the same things they do now all this persuade us they be of the same species as the things respectively represent by them and that it be by a natural resemblance they suggest them to our mind add to this that whenever we make a nice survey of any object successively direct the optic axis to each point thereof there be certain line and figure describe by the motion of the head or eye which be in truth perceive by feel do nevertheless so mix themselves as it be with the ideas of sight that we can scarce think but they appertain to that sense again the ideas of sight enter into the mind several at once more distinct and unmingled than be usual in the other sense beside the touch sound for example perceive at the same instant be apt to coalesce if i may so say into one sound but we can perceive at the same time great variety of visible object very separate and distinct from each other now tangible extension be make up of several distinct coexistent part we may hence gather another reason that may dispose us to imagine a liken or an analogy between the immediate object of sight and touch but nothing certainly doth more contribute to blend and confound them together than the strict and close connexion they have with each other we can not open our eye but the ideas of distance body and tangible figure be suggest by them so swift and sudden and unperceived be the transition from visible to tangible ideas that we can scarce forbear think them equally the immediate object of vision the prejudice which be ground on these and whatever other cause may be assign thereof stick so fast that it be impossible without obstinate strive and labour of the mind to get entirely clear of it but then the reluctancy we find in reject any opinion can be no argument of its truth to whoever consider what have be already show with regard to the prejudice we entertain concern the distance magnitude and situation of object prejudice so familiar to our mind so confirm and inveterate as they will hardly give way to the clearest demonstration upon the whole i think we may fairly conclude that the proper object of vision constitute an universal language of the author of nature whereby we be instruct how to regulate our action in order to attain those things that be necessary to the preservation and wellbeing of our body as also to avoid whatever may be hurtful and destructive of them it be by their information that we be principally guide in all the transactions and concern of life and the manner wherein they signify and mark unto us the object which be at a distance be the same with that of languages and sign of human appointment which do not suggest the things signify by any liken or identity of nature but only by an habitual connexion that experience have make us to observe between them suppose one who have always continue blind be tell by his guide that after he have advance so many step he shall come to the brink of a precipice or be stop by a wall must not this to him seem very admirable and surprizing he can not conceive how it be possible for mortals to frame such predictions as these which to him would seem as strange and unaccountable as prophesy doth to others even they who be bless with the visive faculty may though familiarity make it less observe find therein sufficient cause of admiration the wonderful art and contrivance wherewith it be adjust to those end and purpose for which it be apparently design the vast extent number and variety of object that be at once with so much ease and quickness and pleasure suggest by it all these afford subject for much and please speculation and may if anything give us some glimmer analogous prenotion of things which be place beyond the certain discovery and comprehension of our present state i do not design to trouble myself with draw corollaries from the doctrine i have hitherto lay down if it bear the test others may so far as they shall think convenient employ their thoughts in extend it farther and apply it to whatever purpose it may be subservient to only i can not forbear make some inquiry concern the object of geometry which the subject we have be upon doth naturally lead one to we have show there be no such idea as that of extension in abstract and that there be two kinds of sensible extension and figure which be entirely distinct and heterogeneous from each other now it be natural to inquire which of these be the object of geometry some things there be which at first sight incline one to think geometry conversant about visible extension the constant use of the eye both in the practical and speculative part of that science doth very much induce us thereto it would without doubt seem odd to a mathematician to go about to convince him the diagram he saw upon paper be not the figure or even the liken of the figure which make the subject of the demonstration the contrary be hold an unquestionable truth not only by mathematicians but also by those who apply themselves more particularly to the study of logic i mean who consider the nature of science certainty and demonstration it be by them assign as one reason of the extraordinary clearness and evidence of geometry that in this science the reason be free from those inconvenience which attend the use of arbitrary sign the very ideas themselves be copy out and expose to view upon paper but by the bye how well this agree with what they likewise assert of abstract ideas be the object of geometrical demonstration i leave to be consider to come to a resolution in this point we need only observe what hath be say in sect where it be show that visible extensions in themselves be little regard and have no settle determinable greatness and that men measure altogether by the application of tangible extension to tangible extension all which make it evident that visible extension and figure be not the object of geometry it be therefore plain that visible figure be of the same use in geometry that word be and the one may as well be account the object of that science as the other neither of them be otherwise concern therein than as they represent or suggest to the mind the particular tangible figure connect with them there be indeed this difference between the signification of tangible figure by visible figure and of ideas by word that whereas the latter be variable and uncertain depend altogether on the arbitrary appointment of men the former be fix and immutably the same in all time and place a visible square for instance suggest to the mind the same tangible figure in europe that it doth in america hence it be that the voice of the author of nature which speak to our eye be not liable to that misinterpretation and ambiguity that languages of human contrivance be unavoidably subject to though what have be say may suffice to show what ought to be determine with relation to the object of geometry i shall nevertheless for the fuller illustration thereof consider the case of an intelligence or unbodied spirit which be suppose to see perfectly well ie to have a clear perception of the proper and immediate object of sight but to have no sense of touch whether there be any such be in nature or no be beside my purpose to inquire it sufficeth that the supposition contain no contradiction in it let us now examine what proficiency such a one may be able to make in geometry which speculation will lead us more clearly to see whether the ideas of sight can possibly be the object of that science first then it be certain the aforesaid intelligence could have no idea of a solid or quantity of three dimension which followeth from its not have any idea of distance we indeed be prone to think that we have by sight the ideas of space and solids which ariseth from our imagine that we do strictly speak see distance and some part of an object at a greater distance than others which hath be demonstrate to be the effect of the experience we have have what ideas of touch be connect with such and such ideas attend vision but the intelligence here speak of be suppose to have no experience of touch he would not therefore judge as we do nor have any idea of distance outness or profundity nor consequently of space or body either immediately or by suggestion whence it be plain he can have no notion of those part of geometry which relate to the mensuration of solids and their convex or concave surface and contemplate the properties of line generate by the section of a solid the conceive of any part whereof be beyond the reach of his faculties farther he can not comprehend the manner wherein geometers describe a right line or circle the rule and compass with their use be things of which it be impossible he should have any notion nor be it an easier matter for him to conceive the place of one plane or angle on another in order to prove their equality since that supposeth some idea of distance or external space all which make it evident our pure intelligence could never attain to know so much as the first elements of plane geometry and perhaps upon a nice inquiry it will be find he can not even have an idea of plane figure any more than he can of solids since some idea of distance be necessary to form the idea of a geometrical plane as will appear to whoever shall reflect a little on it all that be properly perceive by the visive faculty amount to no more than colour with their variations and different proportion of light and shade but the perpetual mutability and fleetingness of those immediate object of sight render them incapable of be manage after the manner of geometrical figure nor be it in any degree useful that they should it be true there be divers of them perceive at once and more of some and less of others but accurately to compute their magnitude and assign precise determinate proportion between things so variable and inconstant if we suppose it possible to be do must yet be a very trifle and insignificant labour i must confess men be tempt to think that flat or plane figure be immediate object of sight though they acknowledge solids be not and this opinion be ground on what be observe in paint wherein it seem the ideas immediately imprint on the mind be only of plan variously colour which by a sudden act of the judgment be change into solids but with a little attention we shall find the plan here mention as the immediate object of sight be not visible but tangible plan for when we say that picture be plan we mean thereby that they appear to the touch smooth and uniform but then this smoothness and uniformity or in other word this planeness of the picture be not perceive immediately by vision for it appeareth to the eye various and multiform from all which we may conclude that plan be no more the immediate object of sight than solids what we strictly see be not solids nor yet plan variously colour they be only diversity of colour and some of these suggest to the mind solids and other plane figure just as they have be experience to be connect with the one or the other so that we see plan in the same way that we see solids both be equally suggest by the immediate object of sight which accordingly be themselves denominate plan and solids but though they be call by the same name with the things mark by them they be nevertheless of a nature entirely different as hath be demonstrate what hath be say be if i mistake not sufficient to decide the question we propose to examine concern the ability of a pure spirit such as we have describe to know geometry it be indeed no easy matter for us to enter precisely into the thoughts of such an intelligence because we can not without great pain cleverly separate and disentangle in our thoughts the proper object of sight from those of touch which be connect with them this indeed in a complete degree seem scarce possible to be perform which will not seem strange to us if we consider how hard it be for anyone to hear the word of his native language pronounce in his ears without understand them though he endeavour to disunite the mean from the sound it will nevertheless intrude into his thoughts and he shall find it extreme difficult if not impossible to put himself exactly in the posture of a foreigner that never learn the language so as to be affect barely with the sound themselves and not perceive the signification annex to them by this time i suppose it be clear that neither abstract nor visible extension make the object of geometry the not discern of which may perhaps have create some difficulty and useless labour in mathematics sure i be that somewhat relate thereto have occur to my thoughts which though after the most anxious and repeat examination i be force to think it true doth nevertheless seem so far out of the common road of geometry that i know not whether it may not be think presumption if i should make it public in an age wherein that science hath receive such mighty improvements by new methods great part whereof as well as of the ancient discoveries may perhaps lose their reputation and much of that ardour with which men study the abstruse and fine geometry be abate if what to me and those few to whom i have impart it seem evidently true should really prove to be so
