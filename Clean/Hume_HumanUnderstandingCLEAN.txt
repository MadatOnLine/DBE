nature may be treat after two different manners each of which have its peculiar merit and may contribute to the entertainment instruction and reformation of mankind the one consider man chiefly as bear for action and as influence in his measure by taste and sentiment pursue one object and avoid another accord to the value which these object seem to possess and accord to the light in which they present themselves as virtue of all object be allow to be the most valuable this species of philosophers paint her in the most amiable colour borrow all help from poetry and eloquence and treat their subject in an easy and obvious manner and such as be best fit to please the imagination and engage the affections they select the most strike observations and instance from common life place opposite character in a proper contrast and allure us into the paths of virtue by the view of glory and happiness direct our step in these paths by the soundest precepts and most illustrious examples they make us feel the difference between vice and virtue they excite and regulate our sentiments and so they can but bend our hearts to the love of probity and true honour they think that they have fully attain the end of all their labour the other species of philosophers consider man in the light of a reasonable rather than an active be and endeavour to form his understand more than cultivate his manners they regard human nature as a subject of speculation and with a narrow scrutiny examine it in order to find those principles which regulate our understand excite our sentiments and make us approve or blame any particular object action or behaviour they think it a reproach to all literature that philosophy should not yet have fix beyond controversy the foundation of morals reason and criticism and should for ever talk of truth and falsehood vice and virtue beauty and deformity without be able to determine the source of these distinctions while they attempt this arduous task they be deter by no difficulties but proceed from particular instance to general principles they still push on their enquiries to principles more general and rest not satisfy till they arrive at those original principles by which in every science all human curiosity must be bound though their speculations seem abstract and even unintelligible to common readers they aim at the approbation of the learn and the wise and think themselves sufficiently compensate for the labour of their whole live if they can discover some hide truths which may contribute to the instruction of posterity it be certain that the easy and obvious philosophy will always with the generality of mankind have the preference above the accurate and abstruse and by many will be recommend not only as more agreeable but more useful than the other it enter more into common life mould the heart and affections and by touch those principles which actuate men reform their conduct and bring them nearer to that model of perfection which it describe on the contrary the abstruse philosophy be found on a turn of mind which can not enter into business and action vanish when the philosopher leave the shade and come into open day nor can its principles easily retain any influence over our conduct and behaviour the feel of our heart the agitation of our passions the vehemence of our affections dissipate all its conclusions and reduce the profound philosopher to a mere plebeian this also must be confess that the most durable as well as justest fame have be acquire by the easy philosophy and that abstract reasoners seem hitherto to have enjoy only a momentary reputation from the caprice or ignorance of their own age but have not be able to support their renown with more equitable posterity it be easy for a profound philosopher to commit a mistake in his subtile reason and one mistake be the necessary parent of another while he push on his consequences and be not deter from embrace any conclusion by its unusual appearance or its contradiction to popular opinion but a philosopher who purpose only to represent the common sense of mankind in more beautiful and more engage colour if by accident he fall into error go no farther but renew his appeal to common sense and the natural sentiments of the mind return into the right path and secure himself from any dangerous illusions the fame of cicero flourish at present but that of aristotle be utterly decay la bruyere pass the seas and still maintain his reputation but the glory of malebranche be confine to his own nation and to his own age and addison perhaps will be read with pleasure when locke shall be entirely forget the mere philosopher be a character which be commonly but little acceptable in the world as be suppose to contribute nothing either to the advantage or pleasure of society while he live remote from communication with mankind and be wrap up in principles and notions equally remote from their comprehension on the other hand the mere ignorant be still more despise nor be anything deem a surer sign of an illiberal genius in an age and nation where the sciences flourish than to be entirely destitute of all relish for those noble entertainments the most perfect character be suppose to lie between those extremes retain an equal ability and taste for book company and business preserve in conversation that discernment and delicacy which arise from polite letter and in business that probity and accuracy which be the natural result of a just philosophy in order to diffuse and cultivate so accomplish a character nothing can be more useful than compositions of the easy style and manner which draw not too much from life require no deep application or retreat to be comprehend and send back the student among mankind full of noble sentiments and wise precepts applicable to every exigence of human life by mean of such compositions virtue become amiable science agreeable company instructive and retirement entertain man be a reasonable be and as such receive from science his proper food and nourishment but so narrow be the bound of human understand that little satisfaction can be hop for in this particular either from the extent of security or his acquisitions man be a sociable no less than a reasonable be but neither can he always enjoy company agreeable and amuse or preserve the proper relish for them man be also an active be and from that disposition as well as from the various necessities of human life must submit to business and occupation but the mind require some relaxation and can not always support its bend to care and industry it seem then that nature have point out a mix kind of life as most suitable to the human race and secretly admonish them to allow none of these bias to draw too much so as to incapacitate them for other occupations and entertainments indulge your passion for science say she but let your science be human and such as may have a direct reference to action and society abstruse think and profound research prohibit and will severely punish by the pensive melancholy which they introduce by the endless uncertainty in which they involve you and by the cold reception which your pretend discoveries shall meet with when communicate be a philosopher but amidst all your philosophy be still a man be the generality of mankind content to prefer the easy philosophy to the abstract and profound without throw any blame or contempt on the latter it might not be improper perhaps to comply with this general opinion and allow every man to enjoy without opposition his own taste and sentiment but as the matter be often carry farther even to the absolute reject of all profound reason or what be commonly call metaphysics we shall now proceed to consider what can reasonably be plead in their behalf we may begin with observe that one considerable advantage which result from the accurate and abstract philosophy be its subserviency to the easy and humane which without the former can never attain a sufficient degree of exactness in its sentiments precepts or reason all polite letter be nothing but picture of human life in various attitudes and situations and inspire us with different sentiments of praise or blame admiration or ridicule accord to the qualities of the object which they set before us an artist must be better qualify to succeed in this undertake who besides a delicate taste and a quick apprehension possess an accurate knowledge of the internal fabric the operations of the understand the work of the passions and the various species of sentiment which discriminate vice and virtue how painful soever this inward search or enquiry may appear it become in some measure requisite to those who would describe with success the obvious and outward appearances of life and manners the anatomist present to the eye the most hideous and disagreeable object but his science be useful to the painter in delineate even a venus or an helen while the latter employ all the richest colour of his art and give his figure the most graceful and engage air he must still carry his attention to the inward structure of the human body the position of the muscle the fabric of the bone and the use and figure of every part or organ accuracy be in every case advantageous to beauty and just reason to delicate sentiment in vain would we exalt the one by depreciate the other besides we may observe in every art or profession even those which most concern life or action that a spirit of accuracy however acquire carry all of them nearer their perfection and render them more subservient to the interest of society and though a philosopher may live remote from business the genius of philosophy if carefully cultivate by several must gradually diffuse itself throughout the whole society and bestow a similar correctness on every art and call the politician will acquire greater foresight and subtility in the subdivide and balance of power the lawyer more method and finer principles in his reason and the general more regularity in his discipline and more caution in his plan and operations the stability of modern governments above the ancient and the accuracy of modern philosophy have improve and probably will still improve by similar gradations be there no advantage to be reap from these study beyond the gratification of an innocent curiosity yet ought not even this to be despise as be one accession to those few safe and harmless pleasures which be bestow on the human race the sweetest and most inoffensive path of life lead through the avenues of science and learn and whoever can either remove any obstructions in this way or open up any new prospect ought so far to be esteem a benefactor to mankind and though these research may appear painful and fatigue it be with some mind as with some body which be endow with vigorous and florid health require severe exercise and reap a pleasure from what to the generality of mankind may seem burdensome and laborious obscurity indeed be painful to the mind as well as to the eye but to bring light from obscurity by whatever labour must need be delightful and rejoice but this obscurity in the profound and abstract philosophy be object to not only as painful and fatigue but as the inevitable source of uncertainty and error here indeed lie the justest and most plausible objection against a considerable part of metaphysics that they be not properly a science but arise either from the fruitless efforts of human vanity which would penetrate into subject utterly inaccessible to the understand or from the craft of popular superstitions which be unable to defend themselves on fair grind raise these intangling brambles to cover and protect their weakness chase from the open country these robbers fly into the forest and lie in wait to break in upon every unguarded avenue of the mind and overwhelm it with religious fear and prejudice the stoutest antagonist if he remit his watch a moment be oppress and many through cowardice and folly open the gate to the enemies and willingly receive them with reverence and submission as their legal sovereigns but be this a sufficient reason why philosophers should desist from such research and leave superstition still in possession of her retreat be it not proper to draw an opposite conclusion and perceive the necessity of carry the war into the most secret recess of the enemy in vain do we hope that men from frequent disappointment will at last abandon such airy sciences and discover the proper province of human reason for besides that many persons find too sensible an interest in perpetually recall such topics besides this say the motive of blind despair can never reasonably have place in the sciences since however unsuccessful former attempt may have prove there be still room to hope that the industry good fortune or improve sagacity of succeed generations may reach discoveries unknown to former age each adventurous genius will still leap at the arduous prize and find himself stimulate rather that discourage by the failures of his predecessors while he hop that the glory of achieve so hard an adventure be reserve for him alone the only method of free learn at once from these abstruse question be to enquire seriously into the nature of human understand and show from an exact analysis of its power and capacity that it be by no mean fit for such remote and abstruse subject we must submit to this fatigue in order to live at ease ever after and must cultivate true metaphysics with some care in order to destroy the false and adulterate indolence which to some persons afford a safeguard against this deceitful philosophy be with others overbalance by curiosity and despair which at some moments prevail may give place afterwards to sanguine hop and expectations accurate and just reason be the only catholic remedy fit for all persons and all dispositions and be alone able to subvert that abstruse philosophy and metaphysical jargon which be mix up with popular superstition render it in a manner impenetrable to careless reasoners and give it the air of science and wisdom besides this advantage of reject after deliberate enquiry the most uncertain and disagreeable part of learn there be many positive advantage which result from an accurate scrutiny into the power and faculties of human nature it be remarkable concern the operations of the mind that though most intimately present to us yet whenever they become the object of reflexion they seem involve in obscurity nor can the eye readily find those line and boundaries which dis criminate and distinguish them the object be too fine to remain long in the same aspect or situation and must be apprehend in an instant by a superior penetration derive from nature and improve by habit and reflexion it become therefore no inconsiderable part of science barely to know the different operations of the mind to separate them from each other to class them under their proper head and to correct all that seem disorder in which they lie involve when make the object of reflexion and enquiry this talk of order and distinguish which have no merit when perform with regard to external body the object of our sense rise in its value when direct towards the operations of the mind in proportion to the difficulty and labour which we meet with in perform it and if we can go no farther than this mental geography or delineation of the distinct part and power of the mind it be at least a satisfaction to go so far and the more obvious this science may appear and it be by no mean obvious the more contemptible still must the ignorance of it be esteem in all pretenders to learn and philosophy nor can there remain any suspicion that this science be uncertain and chimerical unless we should entertain such a scepticism as be entirely subversive of all speculation and even action it can not be doubt that the mind be endow with several power and faculties that these power be distinct from each other that what be really distinct to the immediate perception may be distinguish by reflexion and consequently that there be a truth and falsehood in all proposition on this subject and a truth and falsehood which lie not beyond the compass of human understand there be many obvious distinctions of this kind such as those between the will and understand the imagination and passions which fall within the comprehension of every human creature and the finer and more philosophical distinctions be no less real and certain though more difficult to be comprehend some instance especially late ones of success in these enquiries may give us a juster notion of the certainty and solidity of this branch of learn and shall we esteem it worthy the labour of a philosopher to give us a true system of the planets and adjust the position and order of those remote body while we affect to overlook those who with so much success delineate the part of the mind in which we be so intimately concern but may we not hope that philosophy if cultivate with care and encourage by the attention of the public may carry its research still farther and discover at least in some degree the secret spring and principles by which the human mind be actuate in its operations astronomers have long content themselves with prove from the phaenomena the true motion order and magnitude of the heavenly body till a philosopher at last arise who seem from the happiest reason to have also determine the laws and force by which the revolutions of the planets be govern and direct the like have be perform with regard to other part of nature and there be no reason to despair of equal success in our enquiries concern the mental power and economy if prosecute with equal capacity and caution it be probable that one operation and principle of the mind depend on another which again may be resolve into one more general and universal and how far these research may possibly be carry it will be difficult for us before or even after a careful trial exactly to determine this be certain that attempt of this kind be every day make even by those who philosophize the most negligently and nothing can be more requisite than to enter upon the enterprize with thorough care and attention that if it lie within the compass of human understand it may at last be happily achieve if not it may however be reject with some confidence and security this last conclusion surely be not desirable nor ought it to be embrace too rashly for how much must we diminish from the beauty and value of this species of philosophy upon such a supposition moralists have hitherto be accustom when they consider the vast multitude and diversity of those action that excite our approbation or dislike to search for some common principle on which this variety of sentiments might depend and though they have sometimes carry the matter too far by their passion for some one general principle it must however be confess that they be excusable in expect to find some general principles into which all the vices and virtues be justly to be resolve the like have be the endeavour of critics logicians and even politicians nor have their attempt be wholly unsuccessful though perhaps longer time greater accuracy and more ardent application may bring these sciences still nearer their perfection to throw up at once all pretensions of this kind may justly be deem more rash precipitate and dogmatical than even the boldest and most affirmative philosophy that have ever attempt to impose its crude dictate and principles on mankind what though these reason concern human nature seem abstract and of difficult comprehension this afford no presumption of their falsehood on the contrary it seem impossible that what have hitherto escape so many wise and profound philosophers can be very obvious and easy and whatever pain these research may cost us we may think ourselves sufficiently reward not only in point of profit but of pleasure if by that mean we can make any addition to our stock of knowledge in subject of such unspeakable importance but as after all the abstractedness of these speculations be no recommendation but rather a disadvantage to them and as this difficulty may perhaps be surmount by care and art and the avoid of all unnecessary detail we have in the follow enquiry attempt to throw some light upon subject from which uncertainty have hitherto deter the wise and obscurity the ignorant happy if we can unite the boundaries of the different species of philosophy by reconcile profound enquiry with clearness and truth with novelty and still more happy if reason in this easy manner we can undermine the foundations of an abstruse philosophy which seem to have hitherto serve only as a shelter to superstition and a cover to absurdity and error sect of the origin of ideas every one will readily allow that there be a considerable difference between the perceptions of the mind when a man feel the pain of excessive heat or the pleasure of moderate warmth and when he afterwards recall to his memory this sensation or anticipate it by his imagination these faculties may mimic or copy the perceptions of the sense but they never can entirely reach the force and vivacity of the original sentiment the utmost we say of them even when they operate with greatest vigour be that they represent their object in so lively a manner that we could almost say we feel or see it but except the mind be disorder by disease or madness they never can arrive at such a pitch of vivacity as to render these perceptions altogether undistinguishable all the colour of poetry however splendid can never paint natural object in such a manner as to make the description be take for a real landskip the most lively think be still inferior to the dullest sensation we may observe a like distinction to run through all the other perceptions of the mind a man in a fit of anger be actuate in a very different manner from one who only think of that emotion if you tell me that any person be in love easily understand your mean and form a just conception of his situation but never can mistake that conception for the real disorder and agitations of the passion when we reflect on our past sentiments and affections our think be a faithful mirror and copy its object truly but the colour which it employ be faint and dull in comparison of those in which our original perceptions be clothe it require no nice discernment or metaphysical head to mark the distinction between them here therefore we may divide all the perceptions of the mind into two class or species which be distinguish by their different degrees of force and vivacity the less forcible and lively be commonly denominate thoughts or ideas the other species want a name in our language and in most others suppose because it be not requisite for any but philosophical purpose to rank them under a general term or appellation let us therefore use a little freedom and call them impressions employ that word in a sense somewhat different from the usual by the term impression then mean all our more lively perceptions when we hear or see or feel or love or hate or desire or will and impressions be distinguish from ideas which be the less lively perceptions of which we be conscious when we reflect on any of those sensations or movements above mention nothing at first view may seem more unbounded than the think of man which not only escape all human power and authority but be not even restrain within the limit of nature and reality to form monsters and join incongruous shape and appearances cost the imagination no more trouble than to conceive the most natural and familiar object and while the body be confine to one planet along which it creep with pain and difficulty the think can in an instant transport us into the most distant regions of the universe or even beyond the universe into the unbounded chaos where nature be suppose to lie in total confusion what never be see or hear of may yet be conceive nor be any thing beyond the power of think except what imply an absolute contradiction but though our think seem to possess this unbounded liberty we shall find upon a nearer examination that it be really confine within very narrow limit and that all this creative power of the mind amount to no more than the faculty of compound transpose augment or diminish the materials afford us by the sense and experience when we think of a golden mountain we only join two consistent ideas gold and mountain with which we be formerly acquaint a virtuous horse we can conceive because from our own feel we can conceive virtue and this we may unite to the figure and shape of a horse which be an animal familiar to us in short all the materials of think be derive either from our outward or inward sentiment the mixture and composition of these belong alone to the mind and will or to express myself in philosophical language all our ideas or more feeble perceptions be copy of our impressions or more lively ones to prove this the two follow arguments will hope be sufficient first when we analyze our thoughts or ideas however compound or sublime we always find that they resolve themselves into such simple ideas as be copy from a precedent feel or sentiment even those ideas which at first view seem the most wide of this origin be find upon a nearer scrutiny to be derive from it the idea of god as mean an infinitely intelligent wise and good be arise from reflect on the operations of our own mind and augment without limit those qualities of goodness and wisdom we may prosecute this enquiry to what length we please where we shall always find that every idea which we examine be copy from a similar impression those who would assert that this position be not universally true nor without exception have only one and that an easy method of refute it by produce that idea which in their opinion be not derive from this source it will then be incumbent on us if we would maintain our doctrine to produce the impression or lively perception which correspond to it secondly if it happen from a defect of the organ that a man be not susceptible of any species of sensation we always find that he be as little susceptible of the correspondent ideas a blind man can form no notion of colour a deaf man of sound restore either of them that sense in which he be deficient by open this new inlet for his sensations you also open an inlet for the ideas and he find no difficulty in conceive these object the case be the same if the object proper for excite any sensation have never be apply to the organ a laplander or negro have no notion of the relish of wine and though there be few or no instance of a like deficiency in the mind where a person have never felt or be wholly incapable of a sentiment or passion that belong to his species yet we find the same observation to take place in a less degree a man of mild manners can form no idea of inveterate revenge or cruelty nor can a selfish heart easily conceive the heights of friendship and generosity it be readily allow that other be may possess many sense of which we can have no conception because the ideas of them have never be introduce to us in the only manner by which an idea can have access to the mind to wit by the actual feel and sensa tion there be however one contradictory phenomenon which may prove that it be not absolutely impossible for ideas to arise independent of their correspondent impressions believe it will readily be allow that the several distinct ideas of colour which enter by the eye or those of sound which be convey by the ear be really different from each other though at the same time resemble now if this be true of different colour it must be no less so of the different shade of the same colour and each shade produce a distinct idea independent of the rest for if this should be deny it be possible by the continual gradation of shade to run a colour insensibly into what be most remote from it and if you will not allow any of the mean to be different you can not without absurdity deny the extremes to be the same suppose therefore a person to have enjoy his sight for thirty years and to have become perfectly acquaint with colour of all kinds except one particular shade of blue for instance which it never have be his fortune to meet with let all the different shade of that colour except that single one be place before him descend gradually from the deepest to the lightest it be plain that he will perceive a blank where that shade be want and will be sensible that there be a greater distance in that place between the contiguous colour than in any other now ask whether it be possible for him from his own imagination to supply this deficiency and raise up to himself the idea of that particular shade though it have never be convey to him by his sense believe there be few but will be of opinion that he can and this may serve as a proof that the simple ideas be not always in every instance derive from the correspondent impressions though this instance be so singular that it be scarcely worth our observe and do not merit that for it alone we should alter our general maxim here therefore be a proposition which not only seem in itself simple and intelligible but if a proper use be make of it might render every dispute equally intelligible and banish all that jargon which have so long take possession of metaphysical reason and draw disgrace upon them all ideas especially abstract ones be naturally faint and obscure the mind have but a slender hold of them they be apt to be confound with other resemble ideas and when we have often employ any term though without a distinct mean we be apt to imagine it have a determinate idea annex to it on the contrary all impressions that be all sensations either outward or inward be strong and vivid the limit between them be more exactly determine nor be it easy to fall into any error or mistake with regard to them when we entertain therefore any suspicion that a philosophical term be employ without any mean or idea as be but too frequent we need but enquire from what impression be that suppose idea derive and if it be impossible to assign any this will serve to confirm our suspicion by bring ideas into so clear a light we may reasonably hope to remove all dispute which may arise concern their nature and reality but admit these term impressions and ideas in the sense above explain and understand by innate what be original or copy from no precedent perception then may we assert that all our impressions be innate and our ideas not innate to be ingenuous must own it to be my opinion that locke be betray into this question by the schoolmen who make use of undefined term draw out their dispute to a tedious length without ever touch the point in question a like ambiguity and circumlocution seem to run through that philosophers reason on this as well as most other subject sect of the association of ideas it be evident that there be a principle of connexion between the different thoughts or ideas of the mind and that in their appearance to the memory or imagination they introduce each other with a certain degree of method and regularity in our more serious think or discourse this be so observable that any particular think which break in upon the regular tract or chain of ideas be immediately remark and reject and even in our wildest and most wander reveries nay in our very dream we shall find if we reflect that the imagination run not altogether at adventure but that there be still a connexion uphold among the different ideas which succeed each other be the loosest and freest conversation to be transcribe there would immediately be observe something which connect it in all its transition or where this be want the person who break the thread of discourse might still inform you that there have secretly revolve in his mind a succession of think which have gradually lead him from the subject of conversation among different languages even where we can not suspect the least connexion or communication it be find that the word expressive of ideas the most compound do yet nearly correspond to each other a certain proof that the simple ideas comprehend in the compound ones be bind together by some universal principle which have an equal influence on all mankind though it be too obvious to escape observation that different ideas be connect together do not find that any philosopher have attempt to enumerate or class all the principles of association a subject however that seem worthy of curiosity to me there appear to be only three principles of connexion among ideas namely resemblance contiguity in time or place and cause or effect that these principles serve to connect ideas will not believe be much doubt a picture naturally lead our thoughts to the original the mention of one apartment in a build naturally introduce an enquiry or discourse concern the others and if we think of a wind we can scarcely forbear reflect on the pain which follow it but that this enumeration be complete and that there be no other principles of association except these may be difficult to prove to the satisfaction of the reader or even to a man own satisfaction all we can do in such case be to run over several instance and examine carefully the principle which bind the different thoughts to each other never stop till we render the principle as general as possible the more instance we examine and the more care we employ the more assurance shall we acquire that the enumeration which we form from the whole be complete and entire sect sceptical doubt concern the operations of the understand part all the object of human reason or enquiry may naturally be divide into two kinds to wit relations of ideas and matter of fact of the first kind be the sciences of geometry algebra and arithmetic and in short every affirmation which be either intuitively or demonstratively certain that the square of the hypothenuse be equal to the square of the two side be a proposition which express a relation between these figure that three time five be equal to the half of thirty express a relation between these number proposition of this kind be discoverable by the mere operation of think without dependence on what be anywhere existent in the universe though there never be a circle or triangle in nature the truths demonstrate by euclid would for ever retain their certainty and evidence matter of fact which be the second object of human reason be not ascertain in the same manner nor be our evidence of their truth however great of a like nature with the forego the contrary of every matter of fact be still possible because it can never imply a contradiction and be conceive by the mind with the same facility and distinctness as if ever so conformable to reality that the sun will not rise tomorrow be no less intelligible a proposition and imply no more contradiction than the affirmation that it will rise we should in vain therefore attempt to demonstrate its falsehood be it demonstratively false it would imply a contradiction and could never be distinctly conceive by the mind it may therefore be a subject worthy of curiosity to enquire what be the nature of that evidence which assure us of any real existence and matter of fact beyond the present testimony of our sense or the record of our memory this part of philosophy it be observable have be little cultivate either by the ancients or moderns and therefore our doubt and errors in the prosecution of so important an enquiry may be the more excusable while we march through such difficult paths without any guide or direction they may even prove useful by excite curiosity and destroy that implicit faith and security which be the bane of all reason and free enquiry the discovery of defect in the common philosophy if any such there be will not presume be a discouragement but rather an incitement as be usual to attempt something more full and satisfactory than have yet be propose to the public all reason concern matter of fact seem to be found on the realtion of cause and effect by mean of that relation alone we can go beyond the evidence of our memory and sense if you be to ask a man why he believe any matter of fact which be absent for instance that his friend be in the country or in france he would give you a reason and this reason would be some other fact as a letter receive from him or the knowledge of his former resolutions and promise a man find a watch or any other machine in a desert island would conclude that there have once be men in that island all our reason concern fact be of the same nature and here it be constantly suppose that there be a connexion between the present fact and that which be infer from it be there nothing to bind them together the inference would be entirely precarious the hear of an articulate voice and rational discourse in the dark assure us of the presence of some person why because these be the effect of the human make and fabric and closely connect with it if we anatomize all the other reason of this nature we shall find that they be found on the relation of cause and effect and that this relation be either near or remote direct or collateral heat and light be collateral effect of fire and the one effect may justly be infer from the other if we would satisfy ourselves therefore concern the nature of that evidence which assure us of matter of fact we must enquire how we arrive at the knowledge of cause and effect shall venture to affirm as a general proposition which admit of no exception that the knowledge of this relation be not in any instance attain by reason a priori but arise entirely from experience when we find that any particular object be constantly conjoin with each other let an object be present to a man of ever so strong natural reason and abilities if that object be entirely new to him he will not be able by the most accurate examination of its sensible qualities to discover any of its cause or effect adam though his rational faculties be suppose at the very first entirely perfect could not have infer from the fluidity and transparency of water that it would suffocate him or from the light and warmth of fire that it would consume him no object ever discover by the qualities which appear to the sense either the cause which produce it or the effect which will arise from it nor can our reason unassisted by experience ever draw any inference concern real existence and matter of fact this proposition that cause and effect be discoverable not by reason but by experience will readily be admit with regard to such object as we remember to have once be altogether unknown to us since we must be conscious of the utter inability which we then lay under of foretell what would arise from them present two smooth piece of marble to a man who have no tincture of natural philosophy he will never discover that they will adhere together in such a manner as to require great force to separate them in a direct line while they make so small a resistance to a lateral pressure such events as bear little analogy to the common course of nature be also readily confess to be know only by experience nor do any man imagine that the explosion of gunpowder or the attraction of a loadstone could ever be discover by arguments a priori in like manner when an effect be suppose to depend upon an intricate machinery or secret structure of part we make no difficulty in attribute all our knowledge of it to experience who will assert that he can give the ultimate reason why milk or bread be proper nourishment for a man not for a lion or a tiger but the same truth may not appear at first sight to have the same evidence with regard to events which have become familiar to us from our first appearance in the world which bear a close analogy to the whole course of nature and which be suppose to depend on the simple qualities of object without any secret structure of part we be apt to imagine that we could discover these effect by the mere operation of our reason without experience we fancy that be we bring on a sudden into this world we could at first have infer that one billiardball would communicate motion to another upon impulse and that we need not to have wait for the event in order to pronounce with certainty concern it such be the influence of custom that where it be strongest it not only cover our natural ignorance but even conceal itself and seem not to take place merely because it be find in the highest degree but to convince us that all the laws of nature and all the operations of body without exception be know only by experience the follow reflections may perhaps suffice be any object present to us and be we require to pronounce concern the effect which will result from it without consult past observation after what manner beseech you must the mind proceed in this operation it must invent or imagine some event which it ascribe to the object as its effect and it be plain that this invention must be entirely arbitrary the mind can never possibly find the effect in the suppose cause by the most accurate scrutiny and examination for the effect be totally different from the cause and consequently can never be discover in it motion in the second billiardball be a quite distinct event from motion in the first nor be there anything in the one to suggest the smallest hint of the other a stone or piece of metal raise into the air and leave without any support immediately fall but to consider the matter a priori be there anything we discover in this situation which can beget the idea of a downward rather than an upward or any other motion in the stone or metal and as the first imagination or invention of a particular effect in all natural operations be arbitrary where we consult not experience so must we also esteem the suppose tie or connexion between the cause and effect which bind them together and render it impossible that any other effect could result from the operation of that cause when see for instance a billiardball move in a straight line towards another even suppose motion in the second ball should by accident be suggest to me as the result of their contact or impulse may not conceive that a hundred different events might as well follow from that cause may not both these ball remain at absolute rest may not the first ball return in a straight line or leap off from the second in any line or direction all these suppositions be consistent and conceivable why then should we give the preference to one which be no more consistent or conceivable than the rest all our reason a priori will never be able to show us any foundation for this preference in a word then every effect be a distinct event from its cause it could not therefore be discover in the cause and the first invention or conception of it a priori must be entirely arbitrary and even after it be suggest the conjunction of it with the cause must appear equally arbitrary since there be always many other effect which to reason must seem fully as consistent and natural in vain therefore should we pretend to determine any single event or infer any cause or effect without the assistance of observation and experience hence we may discover the reason why no philosopher who be rational and modest have ever pretend to assign the ultimate cause of any natural operation or to show distinctly the action of that power which produce any single effect in the universe it be confess that the utmost effort of human reason be to reduce the principles productive of natural phenomena to a greater simplicity and to resolve the many particular effect into a few general cause by mean of reason from analogy experience and observation but as to the cause of these general cause we should in vain attempt their discovery nor shall we ever be able to satisfy ourselves by any particular explication of them these ultimate spring and principles be totally shut up from human curiosity and enquiry elasticity gravity cohesion of part communication of motion by impulse these be probably the ultimate cause and principles which we shall ever discover in nature and we may esteem ourselves sufficiently happy if by accurate enquiry and reason we can trace up the particular phenomena to or near to these general principles the most perfect philosophy of the natural kind only stave off our ignorance a little longer as perhaps the most perfect philosophy of the moral or metaphysical kind serve only to discover larger portion of it thus the observation of human blindness and weakness be the result of all philosophy and meet us at every turn in spite of our endeavour to elude or avoid it nor be geometry when take into the assistance of natural philosophy ever able to remedy this defect or lead us into the knowledge of ultimate cause by all that accuracy of reason for which it be so justly celebrate every part of mix mathematics proceed upon the supposition that certain laws be establish by nature in her operations and abstract reason be employ either to assist experience in the discovery of these laws or to determine their influence in particular instance where it depend upon any precise degree of distance and quantity thus it be a law of motion discover by experience that the moment or force of any body in motion be in the compound ratio or proportion of its solid content and its velocity and consequently that a small force may remove the greatest obstacle or raise the greatest weight if by any contrivance or machinery we can increase the velocity of that force so as to make it an overmatch for its antagonist geometry assist us in the application of this law by give us the just dimension of all the part and figure which can enter into any species of machine but still the discovery of the law itself be owe merely to experience and all the abstract reason in the world could never lead us one step towards the knowledge of it when we reason a priori and consider merely any object or cause as it appear to the mind independent of all observation it never could suggest to us the notion of any distinct object such as its effect much less show us the inseparable and inviolable connexion between them a man must be very sagacious who could discover by reason that crystal be the effect of heat and ice of cold without be previously acquaint with the operation of these qualities part but we have not yet attain any tolerable satisfaction with regard to the question first propose each solution still give rise to a new question as difficult as the forego and lead us on to farther enquiries when it be ask what be the nature of all our reason concern matter of fact the proper answer seem to be that they be found on the relation of cause and effect when again it be ask what be the foundation of all our reason and conclusions concern that relation it may be reply in one word experience but if we still carry on our sift humour and ask what be the foundation of all conclusions from experience this imply a new question which may be of more difficult solution and explication philosophers that give themselves air of superior wisdom and sufficiency have a hard task when they encounter persons of inquisitive dispositions who push them from every corner to which they retreat and who be sure at last to bring them to some dangerous dilemma the best expedient to prevent this confusion be to be modest in our pretensions and even to discover the difficulty ourselves before it be object to us by this mean we may make a kind of merit of our very ignorance shall content myself in this section with an easy task and shall pretend only to give a negative answer to the question here propose say then that even after we have experience of the operations of cause and effect our conclusions from that experience be not found on reason or any process of the understand this answer we must endeavour both to explain and to defend it must certainly be allow that nature have keep us at a great distance from all her secrets and have afford us only the knowledge of a few superficial qualities of object while she conceal from us those power and principles on which the influence of those object entirely depend our sense inform us of the colour weight and consistence of bread but neither sense nor reason can ever inform us of those qualities which fit it for the nourishment and support of a human body sight or feel convey an idea of the actual motion of body but as to that wonderful force or power which would carry on a move body for ever in a continue change of place and which body never lose but by communicate it to others of this we can not form the most distant conception but notwithstanding this ignorance of natural power and principles we always presume when we see like sensible qualities that they have like secret power and expect that effect similar to those which we have experience will follow from them if a body of like colour and consistence with that bread which we have formerly eat be present to us we make no scruple of repeat the experiment and foresee with certainty like nourishment and support now this be a process of the mind or think of which would willingly know the foundation it be allow on all hand that there be no know connexion between the sensible qualities and the secret power and consequently that the mind be not lead to form such a conclusion concern their constant and regular conjunction by anything which it know of their nature as to past experience it can be allow to give direct and certain information of those precise object only and that precise period of time which fell under its cognizance but why this experience should be extend to future time and to other object which for aught we know may be only in appearance similar this be the main question on which would insist the bread which formerly eat nourish me that be a body of such sensible qualities be at that time endue with such secret power but do it follow that other bread must also nourish me at another time and that like sensible qualities must always be attend with like secret power the consequence seem nowise necessary at least it must be acknowledge that there be here a consequence draw by the mind that there be a certain step take a process of think and an inference which want to be explain these two proposition be far from be the same have find that such an object have always be attend with such an effect and foresee that other object which be in appearance similar will be attend with similar effect shall allow if you please that the one proposition may justly be infer from the other know in fact that it always be infer but if you insist that the inference be make by a chain of reason desire you to produce that reason the connexion between these proposition be not intuitive there be require a medium which may enable the mind to draw such an inference if indeed it be draw by reason and argument what that medium be must confess pass my comprehension and it be incumbent on those to produce it who assert that it really exist and be the origin of all our conclusions concern matter of fact this negative argument must certainly in process of time become altogether convince if many penetrate and able philosophers shall turn their enquiries this way and no one be ever able to discover any connect proposition or intermediate step which support the understand in this conclusion but as the question be yet new every reader may not trust so far to his own penetration as to conclude because an argument escape his enquiry that therefore it do not really exist for this reason it may be requisite to venture upon a more difficult task and enumerate all the branch of human knowledge endeavour to show that none of them can afford such an argument all reason may be divide into two kinds namely demonstrative reason or that concern relations of ideas and moral reason or that concern matter of fact and existence that there be no demonstrative arguments in the case seem evident since it imply no contradiction that the course of nature may change and that an object seemingly like those which we have experience may be attend with different or contrary effect may not clearly and distinctly conceive that a body fall from the cloud and which in all other respect resemble snow have yet the taste of salt or feel of fire be there any more intelligible proposition than to affirm that all the tree will flourish in december and january and decay in may and june now whatever be intelligible and can be distinctly conceive imply no contradiction and can never be prove false by any demonstrative argument or abstract reason a priori if we be therefore engage by arguments to put trust in past experience and make it the standard of our future judgement these arguments must be probable only or such as regard matter of fact and real existence accord to the division above mention but that there be no argument of this kind must appear if our explication of that species of reason be admit as solid and satisfactory we have say that all arguments concern existence be found on the relation of cause and effect that our knowledge of that relation be derive entirely from experience and that all our experimental conclusions proceed upon the supposition that the future will be conformable to the past to endeavour therefore the proof of this last supposition by probable arguments or arguments regard existence must be evidently go in a circle and take that for grant which be the very point in question in reality all arguments from experience be found on the similarity which we discover among natural object and by which we be induce to expect effect similar to those which we have find to follow from such object and though none but a fool or madman will ever pretend to dispute the authority of experience or to reject that great guide of human life it may surely be allow a philosopher to have so much curiosity at least as to examine the principle of human nature which give this mighty authority to experience and make us draw advantage from that similarity which nature have place among different object from cause which appear similar we expect similar effect this be the sum of all our experimental conclusions now it seem evident that if this conclusion be form by reason it would be as perfect at first and upon one instance as after ever so long a course of experience but the case be far otherwise nothing so like as egg yet no one on account of this appear similarity expect the same taste and relish in all of them it be only after a long course of uniform experiment in any kind that we attain a firm reliance and security with regard to a particular event now where be that process of reason which from one instance draw a conclusion so different from that which it infer from a hundred instance that be nowise different from that single one this question propose as much for the sake of information as with an intention of raise difficulties can not find can not imagine any such reason but keep my mind still open to instruction if any one will vouchsafe to bestow it on me should it be say that from a number of uniform experiment we infer a connexion between the sensible qualities and the secret power this must confess seem the same difficulty couch in different term the question still recur on what process of argument this inference be found where be the medium the interpose ideas which join proposition so very wide of each other it be confess that the colour consistence and other sensible qualities of bread appear not of themselves to have any connexion with the secret power of nourishment and support for otherwise we could infer these secret power from the first appearance of these sensible qualities without the aid of experience contrary to the sentiment of all philosophers and contrary to plain matter of fact here then be our natural state of ignorance with regard to the power and influence of all object how be this remedied by experience it only show us a number of uniform effect result from certain object and teach us that those particular object at that particular time be endow with such power and force when a new object endow with similar sensible qualities be produce we expect similar power and force and look for a like effect from a body of like colour and consistence with bread we expect like nourishment and support but this surely be a step or progress of the mind which want to be explain when a man say have find in all past instance such sensible qualities conjoin with such secret power and when he say similar sensible qualities will always be conjoin with similar secret power he be not guilty of a tautology nor be these proposition in any respect the same you say that the one proposition be an inference from the other but you must confess that the inference be not intuitive neither be it demonstrative of what nature be it then to say it be experimental be beg the question for all inferences from experience suppose as their foundation that the future will resemble the past and that similar power will be conjoin with similar sensible qualities if there be any suspicion that the course of nature may change and that the past may be no rule for the future all experience become useless and can give rise to no inference or conclusion it be impossible therefore that any arguments from experience can prove this resem blance of the past to the future since all these arguments be found on the supposition of that resemblance let the course of things be allow hitherto ever so regular that alone without some new argument or inference prove not that for the future it will continue so in vain do you pretend to have learn the nature of body from your past experience their secret nature and consequently all their effect and influence may change without any change in their sensible qualities this happen sometimes and with regard to some object why may it not happen always and with regard to all object what logic what process of argument secure you against this supposition my practice you say refute my doubt but you mistake the purport of my question as an agent be quite satisfy in the point but as a philosopher who have some share of curiosity will not say scepticism want to learn the foundation of this inference no read no enquiry have yet be able to remove my difficulty or give me satisfaction in a matter of such importance can do better than propose the difficulty to the public even though perhaps have small hop of obtain a solution we shall at least by this mean be sensible of our ignorance if we do not augment our knowledge must confess that a man be guilty of unpardonable arrogance who conclude because an argument have escape his own investigation that therefore it do not really exist must also confess that though all the learn for several age should have employ themselves in fruitless search upon any subject it may still perhaps be rash to conclude positively that the subject must therefore pass all human comprehension even though we examine all the source of our knowledge and conclude them unfit for such a subject there may still remain a suspicion that the enumeration be not complete or the examination not accurate but with regard to the present subject there be some considerations which seem to remove all this accusation of arrogance or suspicion of mistake it be certain that the most ignorant and stupid peasants nay infants nay even brute beasts improve by experience and learn the qualities of natural object by observe the effect which result from them when a child have felt the sensation of pain from touch the flame of a candle he will be careful not to put his hand near any candle but will expect a similar effect from a cause which be similar in its sensible qualities and appearance if you assert therefore that the understand of the child be lead into this conclusion by any process of argument or ratiocination may justly require you to produce that argument nor have you any pretence to refuse so equitable a demand you can not say that the argument be abstruse and may possibly escape your enquiry since you confess that it be obvious to the capacity of a mere infant if you hesitate therefore a moment or if after reflection you produce any intricate or profound argument you in a manner give up the question and confess that it be not reason which engage us to suppose the past resemble the future and to expect similar effect from cause which be to appearance similar this be the proposition which intend to enforce in the present section if be right pretend not to have make any mighty discovery and if be wrong must acknowledge myself to be indeed a very backward scholar since can not now discover an argument which it seem be perfectly familiar to me long before be out of my cradle sect sceptical solution of these doubt part the passion for philosophy like that for religion seem liable to this inconvenience that though it aim at the correction of our manners and extirpation of our vices it may only serve by imprudent management to foster a predominant inclination and push the mind with more determine resolution towards that side which already draw too much by the bias and propensity of the natural temper it be certain that while we aspire to the magnanimous firmness of the philosophic sage and endeavour to confine our pleasures altogether within our own mind we may at last render our philosophy like that of epictetus and other stoics only a more refine system of selfishness and reason ourselves out of all virtue as well as social enjoyment while we study with attention the vanity of human life and turn all our thoughts towards the empty and transitory nature of riches and honour we be perhaps all the while flatter our natural indolence which hat the bustle of the world and drudgery of business seek a pretence of reason to give itself a full and uncontrolled indulgence there be however one species of philosophy which seem little liable to this inconvenience and that because it strike in with no disorderly passion of the human mind nor can mingle itself with any natural affection or propensity and that be the academic or sceptical philosophy the academics always talk of doubt and suspense of judgement of danger in hasty determinations of confine to very narrow bound the enquiries of the understand and of renounce all speculations which lie not within the limit of common life and practice nothing therefore can be more contrary than such a philosophy to the supine indolence of the mind its rash arrogance its lofty pretensions and its superstitious credulity every passion be mortify by it except the love of truth and that passion never be nor can be carry to too high a degree it be surprise therefore that this philosophy which in almost every instance must be harmless and innocent should be the subject of so much groundless reproach and obloquy but perhaps the very circumstance which render it so innocent be what chiefly expose it to the public hatred and resentment by flatter no irregular passion it gain few partizans by oppose so many vices and follies it raise to itself abundance of enemies who stigmatize it as libertine profane and irreligious nor need we fear that this philosophy while it endeavour to limit our enquiries to common life should ever undermine the reason of common life and carry its doubt so far as to destroy all action as well as speculation nature will always maintain her right and prevail in the end over any abstract reason whatsoever though we should conclude for instance as in the forego section that in all reason from experience there be a step take by the mind which be not support by any argument or process of the understand there be no danger that these reason on which almost all knowledge depend will ever be affect by such a discovery if the mind be not engage by argument to make this step it must be induce by some other principle of equal weight and authority and that principle will preserve its influence as long as human nature remain the same what that principle be may well be worth the pain of enquiry suppose a person though endow with the strongest faculties of reason and reflection to be bring on a sudden into this world he would indeed immediately observe a continual succession of object and one event follow another but he would not be able to discover anything farther he would not at first by any reason be able to reach the idea of cause and effect since the particular power by which all natural operations be perform never appear to the sense nor be it reasonable to conclude merely because one event in one instance precede another that therefore the one be the cause the other the effect their conjunction may be arbitrary and casual there may be no reason to infer the existence of one from the appearance of the other and in a word such a person without more experience could never employ his conjecture or reason concern any matter of fact or be assure of anything beyond what be immediately present to his memory and sense suppose again that he have acquire more experience and have live so long in the world as to have observe familiar object or events to be constantly conjoin together what be the consequence of this experience he immediately infer the existence of one object from the appearance of the other yet he have not by all his experience acquire any idea or knowledge of the secret power by which the one object produce the other nor be it by any process of reason he be engage to draw this inference but still he find himself determine to draw it and though he should be convince that his understand have no part in the operation he would nevertheless continue in the same course of think there be some other principle which determine him to form such a conclusion this principle be custom or habit for wherever the repetition of any particular act or operation produce a propensity to renew the same act or operation without be impel by any reason or process of the understand we always say that this propensity be the effect of custom by employ that word we pretend not to have give the ultimate reason of such a propensity we only point out a principle of human nature which be universally acknowledge and which be well know by its effect perhaps we can push our enquiries no farther or pretend to give the cause of this cause but must rest content with it as the ultimate principle which we can assign of all our conclusions from experience it be sufficient satisfaction that we can go so far without repine at the narrowness of our faculties because they will carry us no farther and it be certain we here advance a very intelligible proposition at least if not a true one when we assert that after the constant conjunction of two object heat and flame for instance weight and solidity we be determine by custom alone to expect the one from the appearance of the other this hypothesis seem even the only one which explain the difficulty why we draw from a thousand instance an inference which we be not able to draw from one instance that be in no respect different from them reason be incapable of any such variation the conclusions which it draw from consider one circle be the same which it would form upon survey all the circle in the universe but no man have see only one body move after be impel by another could infer that every other body will move after a like impulse all inferences from experience therefore be effect of custom not of reason the same distinction between reason and experience be maintain in all our deliberations concern the conduct of life while the experience statesman general physician or merchant be trust and follow and the unpractised novice with whatever natural talents endow neglect and despise though it be allow that reason may form very plausible conjecture with regard to the consequences of such a particular conduct in such particular circumstances it be still suppose imperfect without the assistance of experience which be alone able to give stability and certainty to the maxims derive from study and reflection but notwithstanding that this distinction be thus universally receive both in the active speculative scenes of life shall not scruple to pronounce that it be at bottom erroneous at least superficial if we examine those arguments which in any of the sciences above mention be suppose to be mere effect of reason and reflection they will be find to terminate at last in some general principle or conclusion for which we can assign no reason but observation and experience the only difference between them and those maxims which be vulgarly esteem the result of pure experience be that the former can not be establish without some process of think and some reflection on what we have observe in order to distinguish its circumstances and trace its consequences whereas in the latter the experience event be exactly and fully familiar to that which we infer as the result of any particular situation the history of a tiberius or a nero make us dread a like tyranny be our monarchs free from the restraints of laws and senates but the observation of any fraud or cruelty in private life be sufficient with the aid of a little think to give us the same apprehension while it serve as an instance of the general corruption of human nature and show us the danger which we must incur by repose an entire confidence in mankind in both case it be experience which be ultimately the foundation of our inference and conclusion there be no man so young and unexperienced as not to have form from observation many general and just maxims concern human affairs and the conduct of life but it must be confess that when a man come to put these in practice he will be extremely liable to error till time and farther experience both enlarge these maxims and teach him their proper use and application in every situation or incident there be many particular and seemingly minute circumstances which the man of greatest talent be at first apt to overlook though on them the justness of his conclusions and consequently the prudence of his con duct entirely depend not to mention that to a young beginner the general observations and maxims occur not always on the proper occasion nor can be immediately apply with due calmness and distinction the truth be an unexperienced reasoner could be no reasoner at all be he absolutely unexperienced and when we assign that character to any one we mean it only in a comparative sense and suppose him possess of experience in a smaller and more imperfect degree custom then be the great guide of human life it be that principle alone which render our experience useful to us and make us expect for the future a similar train of events with those which have appear in the past without the influence of custom we should be entirely ignorant of every matter of fact beyond what be immediately present to the memory and sense we should never know how to adjust mean to end or to employ our natural power in the production of any effect there would be an end at once of all action as well as of the chief part of speculation but here it may be proper to remark that though our conclusions from experience carry us beyond our memory and sense and assure us of matter of fact which happen in the most distant place and most remote age yet some fact must always be present to the sense or memory from which we may first proceed in draw these conclusions a man who should find in a desert country the remain of pompous build would conclude that the country have in ancient time be cultivate by civilize inhabitants but do nothing of this nature occur to him he could never form such an inference we learn the events of former age from history but then we must peruse the volumes in which this instruction be contain and thence carry up our inferences from one testimony to another till we arrive at the eyewitness and spectators of these distant events in a word if we proceed not upon some fact present to the memory or sense our reason would be merely hypothetical and however the particular link might be connect with each other the whole chain of inferences would have nothing to support it nor could we ever by its mean arrive at the knowledge of any real existence if ask why you believe any particular matter of fact which you relate you must tell me some reason and this reason will be some other fact connect with it but as you can not proceed after this manner in infinitum you must at last terminate in some fact which be present to your memory or sense or must allow that your belief be entirely without foundation what then be the conclusion of the whole matter a simple one though it must be confess pretty remote from the common theories of philosophy all belief of matter of fact or real existence be derive merely from some object present to the memory or sense and a customary conjunction between that and some other object or in other word have find in many instance that any two kinds of objectsflame and heat snow and cold have always be conjoin together if flame or snow be present anew to the sense the mind be carry by custom to expect heat or cold and to believe that such a quality do exist and will discover itself upon a nearer approach this belief be the necessary result of place the mind in such circumstances it be an operation of the soul when we be so situate as unavoidable as to feel the passion of love when we receive benefit or hatred when we meet with injuries all these operations be a species of natural instincts which no reason or process of the think and understand be able either to produce or to prevent at this point it would be very allowable for us to stop our philosophical research in most question we can never make a single step further and in all question we must terminate here at last after our most restless and curious enquiries but still our curiosity will be pardonable perhaps commendable if it carry us on to still farther research and make us examine more accurately the nature of this belief and of the customary conjunction whence it be derive by this mean we may meet with some explications and analogies that will give satisfaction at least to such as love the abstract sciences and can be entertain with speculations which however accurate may still retain a degree of doubt and uncertainty as to readers of a different taste the remain part of this section be not calculate for them and the follow enquiries may well be understand though it be neglect part nothing be more free than the imagination of man and though it can not exceed that original stock of ideas furnish by the internal and external sense it have unlimited power of mix compound separate and divide these ideas in all the varieties of fiction and vision it can feign a train of events with all the appearance of reality ascribe to them a particular time and place conceive them as existent and paint them out to itself with every circumstance that belong to any historical fact which it believe with the greatest certainty wherein therefore consist the difference between such a fiction and belief it lie not merely in any peculiar idea which be annex to such a conception as command our assent and which be want to every know fiction for as the mind have authority over all its ideas it could voluntarily annex this particular idea to any fiction and consequently be able to believe whatever it please contrary to what we find by daily experience we can in our conception join the head of a man to the body of a horse but it be not in our power to believe that such an animal have ever really exist it follow therefore that the difference between fiction and belief lie in some sentiment or feel which be annex to the latter not to the former and which depend not on the will nor can be command at pleasure it must be excite by nature like all other sentiments and must arise from the particular situation in which the mind be place at any particular juncture whenever any object be present to the memory or sense it immediately by the force of custom carry the imagination to conceive that object which be usually conjoin to it and this conception be attend with a feel or sentiment different from the loose reveries of the fancy in this consist the whole nature of belief for as there be no matter of fact which we believe so firmly that we can not conceive the contrary there would be no difference between the conception assent to and that which be reject be it not for some sentiment which distinguish the one from the other if see a billiardball move towards another on a smooth table can easily conceive it to stop upon contact this conception imply no contradiction but still it feel very differently from that conception by which represent to myself the impulse and the communication of motion from one ball to another be we to attempt a definition of this sentiment we should perhaps find it a very difficult if not an impossible task in the same manner as if we should endeavour to define the feel of cold or passion of anger to a creature who never have any experience of these sentiments belief be the true and proper name of this feel and no one be ever at a loss to know the mean of that term because every man be every moment conscious of the sentiment represent by it it may not however be improper to attempt a description of this sentiment in hop we may by that mean arrive at some analogies which may afford a more perfect explication of it say then that belief be nothing but a more vivid lively forcible firm steady conception of an object than what the imagination alone be ever able to attain this variety of term which may seem so unphilosophical be intend only to express that act of the mind which render realities or what be take for such more present to us than fictions cause them to weigh more in the think and give them a superior influence on the passions and imagination provide we agree about the thing it be needle to dispute about the term the imagination have the command over all its ideas and can join and mix and vary them in all the ways possible it may conceive fictitious object with all the circumstances of place and time it may set them in a manner before our eye in their true colour just as they might have exist but as it be impossible that this faculty of imagination can ever of itself reach belief it be evident that belief consist not in the peculiar nature or order of ideas but in the manner of their conception and in their feel to the mind confess that it be impossible perfectly to explain this feel or manner of conception we may make use of word which express something near it but its true and proper name as we observe before be belief which be a term that every one sufficiently understand in common life and in philosophy we can go no farther than assert that belief be something felt by the mind which distinguish the ideas of the judgement from the fictions of the imagination it give them more weight and influence make them appear of greater importance enforce them in the mind and render them the govern principle of our action hear at present for instance a persons voice with whom be acquaint and the sound come as from the next room this impression of my sense immediately convey my think to the person together with all the surround object paint them out to myself as exist at present with the same qualities and relations of which formerly know them possess these ideas take faster hold of my mind than ideas of an enchant castle they be very different to the feel and have a much greater influence of every kind either to give pleasure or pain joy or sorrow let us then take in the whole compass of this doctrine and allow that the sentiment of belief be nothing but a conception more intense and steady than what attend the mere fictions of the imagination and that this manner of conception arise from a customary conjunction of the object with something present to the memory or sense believe that it will not be difficult upon these suppositions to find other operations of the mind analogous to it and to trace up these phenomena to principles still more general we have already observe that nature have establish connexions among particular ideas and that no sooner one idea occur to our thoughts than it introduce its correlative and carry our attention towards it by a gentle and insensible movement these principles of connexion or association we have reduce to three namely resemblance contiguity and causation which be the only bond that unite our thoughts together and beget that regular train of reflection or discourse which in a greater or less degree take place among all mankind now here arise a question on which the solution of the present difficulty will depend do it happen in all these relations that when one of the object be present to the sense or memory the mind be not only carry to the conception of the correlative but reach a steadier and stronger conception of it than what otherwise it would have be able to attain this seem to be the case with that belief which arise from the relation of cause and effect and if the case be the same with the other relations or principles of associations this may be establish as a general law which take place in all the operations of the mind we may therefore observe as the first experiment to our present purpose that upon the appearance of the picture of an absent friend our idea of him be evidently enliven by the resemblance and that every passion which that idea occasion whether of joy or sorrow acquire new force and vigour in produce this effect there concur both a relation and a present impression where the picture bear him no resemblance at least be not intend for him it never so much as convey our think to him and where it be absent as well as the person though the mind may pass from the think of the one to that of the other it feel its idea to be rather weaken than enliven by that transition we take a pleasure in view the picture of a friend when it be set before us but when it be remove rather choose to consider him directly than by reflection in an image which be equally distant and obscure the ceremonies of the roman catholic religion may be consider as instance of the same nature the devote of that superstition usually plead in excuse for the mummeries with which they be upbraid that they feel the good effect of those external motion and posture and action in enliven their devotion and quicken their fervour which otherwise would decay if direct entirely to distant and immaterial object we shadow out the object of our faith say they in sensible type and image and render them more present to us by the immediate presence of these type than it be possible for us to do merely by an intellectual view and contemplation sensible object have always a greater influence on the fancy than any other and this influence they readily convey to those ideas to which they be relate and which they resemble shall only infer from these practice and this reason that the effect of resemblance in enliven the ideas be very common and as in every case a resemblance and a present impression must concur we be abundantly supply with experiment to prove the reality of the forego principle we may add force to these experiment by others of a different kind in consider the effect of contiguity as well as of resemblance it be certain that distance diminish the force of every idea and that upon our approach to any object though it do not discover itself to our sense it operate upon the mind with an influence which imitate an immediate impression the think on any object readily transport the mind to what be contiguous but it be only the actual presence of an object that transport it with a superior vivacity when be a few miles from home whatever relate to it touch me more nearly than when be two hundred league distant though even at that distance the reflect on anything in the neighbourhood of my friends or family naturally produce an idea of them but as in this latter case both the object of the mind be ideas notwithstanding there be an easy transition between them that transition alone be not able to give a superior vivacity to any of the ideas for want of some immediate impression no one can doubt but causation have the same influence as the other two relations of resemblance and contiguity superstitious people be fond of the reliques of saint and holy men for the same reason that they seek after type or image in order to enliven their devotion and give them a more intimate and strong conception of those exemplary live which they desire to imitate now it be evident that one of the best reliques which a devotee could procure would be the handywork of a saint and if his cloaths and furniture be ever to be consider in this light it be because they be once at his disposal and be move and affect by him in which respect they be to be consider as imperfect effect and as connect with him by a shorter chain of consequences than any of those by which we learn the reality of his existence suppose that the son of a friend who have be long dead or absent be present to us it be evident that this object would instantly revive its correlative idea and recal to our thoughts all past intimacies and familiarities in more lively colour than they would otherwise have ap peared to us this be another phaenomenon which seem to prove the principle above mention we may observe that in these phaenomena the belief of the correlative object be always presuppose without which the relation could have no effect the influence of the picture suppose that we believe our friend to have once exist continguity to home can never excite our ideas of home unless we believe that it really exist now assert that this belief where it reach beyond the memory or sense be of a similar nature and arise from similar cause with the transition of think and vivacity of conception here explain when throw a piece of dry wood into a fire my mind be immediately carry to conceive that it augment not extinguish the flame this transition of think from the cause to the effect proceed not from reason it derive its origin altogether from custom and experience and as it first begin from an object present to the sense it render the idea or conception of flame more strong and lively than any loose float reverie of the imagination that idea arise immediately the think move instantly towards it and convey to it all that force of conception which be derive from the impression present to the sense when a sword be level at my breast do not the idea of wind and pain strike me more strongly than when a glass of wine be present to me even though by accident this idea should occur after the appearance of the latter object but what be there in this whole matter to cause such a strong conception except only a present object and a customary transition to the idea of another object which we have be accustom to conjoin with the former this be the whole operation of the mind in all our conclusions concern matter of fact and existence and it be a satisfaction to find some analogies by which it may be explain the transition from a present object do in all case give strength and solidity to the relate idea here then be a kind of preestablished harmony between the course of nature and the succession of our ideas and though the power and force by which the former be govern be wholly unknown to us yet our thoughts and conceptions have still we find go on in the same train with the other work of nature custom be that principle by which this correspondence have be effect so necessary to the subsistence of our species and the regulation of our conduct in every circumstance and occurrence of human life have not the presence of an object instantly excite the idea of those object commonly conjoin with it all our knowledge must have be limit to the narrow sphere of our memory and sense and we should never have be able to adjust mean to end or employ our natural power either to the produce of good or avoid of evil those who delight in the discovery and contemplation of final cause have here ample subject to employ their wonder and admiration shall add for a further confirmation of the forego theory that as this operation of the mind by which we infer like effect from like cause and vice versa be so essential to the subsistence of all human creatures it be not probable that it could be trust to the fallacious deductions of our reason which be slow in its operations appear not in any degree during the first years of infancy and at best be in every age and period of human life extremely liable to error and mistake it be more conformable to the ordinary wisdom of nature to secure so necessary an act of the mind by some instinct or mechanical tendency which may be infallible in its operations may discover itself at the first appearance of life and think and may be independent of all the labour deductions of the understand as nature have teach us the use of our limbs without give us the knowledge of the muscle and nerve by which they be actuate so have she implant in us an instinct which carry forward the think in a correspondent course to that which she have establish among external object though we be ignorant of those power and force on which this regular course and succession of object totally depend sect of probability though there be no such thing as chance in the world our ignorance of the real cause of any event have the same influence on the understand and beget a like species of belief or opinion there be certainly a probability which arise from a superiority of chance on any side and accord as this superiority encreases and surpass the opposite chance the probability receive a proportionable encrease and beget still a higher degree of belief or assent to that side in which we discover the superiority if a die be mark with one figure or number of spot on four side and with another figure or number of spot on the two remain side it would be more probable that the former would turn up than the latter though if it have a thousand side mark in the same manner and only one side different the probability would be much higher and our belief or expectation of the event more steady and secure this process of the think or reason may seem trivial and obvious but to those who consider it more narrowly it may perhaps afford matter for curious speculation it seem evident that when the mind look forward to discover the event which may result from the throw of such a die it consider the turn up of each particular side as alike probable and this the very nature of chance to render all the particular events comprehend in it entirely equal but find a greater number of side concur in the one event than in the other the mind be carry more frequently to that event and meet it oftener in revolve the various possibilities or chance on which the ultimate result depend this concurrence of several view in one particular event beget immediately by an inexplicable contrivance of nature the sentiment of belief and give that event the advantage over its antagonist which be support by a smaller number of view and recur less frequently to the mind if we allow that belief be nothing but a firmer and stronger conception of an object than what attend the mere fictions of the imagination this operation may perhaps in some measure be account for the concurrence of these several view or glimpse imprint the idea more strongly on the imagination give it superior force and vigour render its influence on the passions and affections more sensible and in a word beget that reliance or security which constitute the nature of belief and opinion the case be the same with the probability of cause as with that of chance there be some cause which be entirely uniform and constant in produce a particular effect and no instance have ever yet be find of any failure or irregularity in their operation fire have always burn and water suffocate every human creature the production of motion by impulse and gravity be an universal law which have hitherto admit of no exception but there be other cause which have be find more irregular and uncertain nor have rhubarb always prove a purge or opium a soporific to every one who have take these medicine it be true when any cause fail of produce its usual effect philosophers ascribe not this to any irregularity in nature but suppose that some secret cause in the particular structure of part have prevent the operation our reason however and conclusions concern the event be the same as if this principle have no place be determine by custom to transfer the past to the future in all our inferences where the past have be entirely regular and uniform we expect the event with the greatest assurance and leave no room for any contrary supposition but where different effect have be find to follow from cause which be to appearance exactly similar all these various effect must occur to the mind in transfer the past to the future and enter into our consideration when we determine the probability of the event though we give the preference to that which have be find most usual and believe that this effect will exist we must not overlook the other effect but must assign to each of them a particular weight and authority in proportion as we have find it to be more or less frequent it be more probable in almost every country of europe that there will be frost sometime in january than that the weather will continue open throughout that whole month though this probability vary accord to the different climates and approach to a certainty in the more northern kingdoms here then it seem evident that when we transfer the past to the future in order to determine the effect which will result from any cause we transfer all the different events in the same proportion as they have appear in the past and conceive one to have exist a hundred time for instance another ten time and another once as a great number of view do here concur in one event they fortify and confirm it to the imagination beget that sentiment which we call belief and give its object the preference above the contrary event which be not support by an equal number of experiment and recur not so frequently to the think in transfer the past to the future let any one try to account for this operation of the mind upon any of the receive systems of philosophy and he will be sensible of the difficulty for my part shall think it sufficient if the present hint excite the curiosity of philosophers and make them sensible how defective all common theories be in treat of such curious and such sublime subject sect of the idea of necessary connexion part the great advantage of the mathematical sciences above the moral consist in this that the ideas of the former be sensible be always clear and determinate the smallest distinction between them be immediately perceptible and the same term be still expressive of the same ideas without ambiguity or variation an oval be never mistake for a circle nor an hyperbola for an ellipsis the isosceles and scalenum be distinguish by boundaries more exact than vice and virtue right and wrong if any term be define in geometry the mind readily of itself substitute on all occasion the definition for the term define or even when no definition be employ the object itself may be present to the sense and by that mean be steadily and clearly apprehend but the finer sentiments of the mind the operations of the understand the various agitations of the passions though really in themselves distinct easily escape us when survey by reflection nor be it in our power to recal the original object as often as we have occasion to contemplate it ambiguity by this mean be gradually introduce into our reason similar object be readily take to be the same and the conclusion become at last very wide of the premise one may safely however affirm that if we consider these sciences in a proper light their advantage and disadvantage nearly compensate each other and reduce both of them to a state of equality if the mind with greater facility retain the ideas of geometry clear and determinate it must carry on a much longer and more intricate chain of reason and compare ideas much wider of each other in order to reach the abstruser truths of that science and if moral ideas be apt without extreme care to fall into obscurity and confusion the inferences be always much shorter in these disquisitions and the intermediate step which lead to the conclusion much fewer than in the sciences which treat of quantity and number in reality there be scarcely a proposition in euclid so simple as not to consist of more part than be to be find in any moral reason which run not into chimera and conceit where we trace the principles of the human mind through a few step we may be very well satisfy with our progress consider how soon nature throw a bar to all our enquiries concern cause and reduce us to an acknowledgment of our ignorance the chief obstacle therefore to our improvement in the moral or metaphysical sciences be the obscurity of the ideas and ambiguity of the term the principal difficulty in the mathematics be the length of inferences and compass of think requisite to the form of any conclusion and perhaps our progress in natural philosophy be chiefly retard by the want of proper experiment and phaenomena which be often discover by chance and can not always be find when requisite even by the most diligent and prudent enquiry as moral philosophy seem hitherto to have receive less improvement than either geometry or physics we may conclude that if there be any difference in this respect among these sciences the difficulties which obstruct the progress of the former require superior care and capacity to be surmount there be no ideas which occur in metaphysics more obscure and uncertain than those of power force energy or necessary connexion of which it be every moment necessary for us to treat in all our disquisitions we shall therefore endeavour in this section to fix if possible the precise mean of these term and thereby remove some part of that obscurity which be so much complain of in this species of philosophy it seem a proposition which will not admit of much dispute that all our ideas be nothing but copy of our impressions or in other word that it be impossible for us to think of anything which we have not antecedently felt either by our external or internal sense have endeavour to explain and prove this proposition and have express my hop that by a proper application of it men may reach a greater clearness and precision in philosophical reason than what they have hitherto be able to attain complex ideas may perhaps be well know by definition which be nothing but an enumeration of those part or simple ideas that compose them but when we have push up definitions to the most simple ideas and find still some ambiguity and obscurity what resource be we then possess of by what invention can we throw light upon these ideas and render them altogether precise and determinate to our intellectual view produce the impressions or original sentiments from which the ideas be copy these impressions be all strong and sensible they admit not of ambiguity they be not only place in a full light themselves but may throw light on their correspondent ideas which lie in obscurity and by this mean we may perhaps attain a new microscope or species of optics by which in the moral sciences the most minute and most simple ideas may be so enlarge as to fall readily under our apprehension and be equally know with the grossest and most sensible ideas that can be the object of our enquiry to be fully acquaint therefore with the idea of power or necessary connexion let us examine its impression and in order to find the impression with greater certainty let us search for it in all the source from which it may possibly be derive when we look about us towards external object and consider the operation of cause we be never able in a single instance to discover any power or necessary connexion any quality which bind the effect to the cause and render the one an infallible consequence of the other we only find that the one do actually in fact follow the other the impulse of one billiardball be attend with motion in the second this be the whole that appear to the outward sense the mind feel no sen timent or inward impression from this succession of object consequently there be not in any single particular instance of cause and effect anything which can suggest the idea of power or necessary connexion from the first appearance of an object we never can conjecture what effect will result from it but be the power or energy of any cause discoverable by the mind we could foresee the effect even without experience and might at first pronounce with certainty concern it by mere dint of think and reason in reality there be no part of matter that do ever by its sensible qualities discover any power or energy or give us grind to imagine that it could produce any thing or be follow by any other object which we could denominate its effect solidity extension motion these qualities be all complete in themselves and never point out any other event which may result from them the scenes of the universe be continually shift and one object follow another in an uninterrupted succession but the power of force which actuate the whole machine be entirely conceal from us and never discover itself in any of the sensible qualities of body we know that in fact heat be a constant attendant of flame but what be the connexion between them we have no room so much as to conjecture or imagine it be impossible therefore that the idea of power can be derive from the contemplation of body in single instance of their operation because no body ever discover any power which can be the original of this idea since therefore external object as they appear to the sense give us no idea of power or necessary connexion by their operation in particular instance let us see whether this idea be derive from reflection on the operations of our own mind and be copy from any internal impression it may be say that we be every moment conscious of internal power while we feel that by the simple command of our will we can move the organs of our body or direct the faculties of our mind an act of volition produce motion in our limbs or raise a new idea in our imagination this influence of the will we know by consciousness hence we acquire the idea of power or energy and be certain that we ourselves and all other intelligent be be possess of power this idea then be an idea of reflection since it arise from reflect on the operations of our own mind and on the command which be exercise by will both over the organs of the body and faculties of the soul we shall proceed to examine this pretension and first with re gard to the influence of volition over the organs of the body this influence we may observe be a fact which like all other natural events can be know only be experience and can never be foresee from any apparent energy or power in the cause which connect it with the effect and render the one an infallible consequence of the other the motion of our body follow upon the command of our will of this we be every moment conscious but the mean by which this be effect the energy by which the will perform so extraordinary an operation of this we be so far from be immediately conscious that it must for ever escape our most diligent enquiry for first be there any principle in all nature more mysterious than the union of soul with body by which a suppose spiritual substance acquire such an influence over a material one that the most refine think be able to actuate the grossest matter be we empower by a secret wish to remove mountains or control the planets in their orbit this extensive authority would not be more extraordinary nor more beyond our comprehension but if by consciousness we perceive any power or energy in the will we must know this power we must know its connexion with the effect we must know the secret union of soul and body and the nature of both these substances by which the one be able to operate in so many instance upon the other secondly we be not able to move all the organs of the body with a like authority though we can not assign any reason besides experience for so remarkable a difference between one and the other why have the will an influence over the tongue and finger not over the heart or liver this question would never embarrass us be we conscious of a power in the former case not in the latter we should then perceive independent of experience why the authority of will over the organs of the body be circumscribe within such particular limit be in that case fully acquaint with the power or force by which it operate we should also know why its influence reach precisely to such boundaries and no farther a man suddenly strike with palsy in the leg or arm or who have newly lose those members frequently endeavour at first to move them and employ them in their usual offices here he be as much conscious of power to command such limbs as a man in perfect health be conscious of power to actuate any member which remain in its natural state and condition but consciousness never deceive consequently neither in the one case nor in the other be we ever conscious of any power we learn the influence of our will from experience alone and experience only teach us how one event constantly follow another without instruct us in the secret connexion which bind them together and render them inseparable thirdly we learn from anatomy that the immediate object of power in voluntary motion be not the member itself which be move but certain muscle and nerve and animal spirit and perhaps something still more minute and more unknown through which the motion be successively propagate ere it reach the member itself whose motion be the immediate object of volition can there be a more certain proof that the power by which this whole operation be perform so far from be directly and fully know by an inward sentiment or consciousness be to the last degree mysterious and unintelligible here the mind will a certain event immediately another event unknown to ourselves and totally different from the one intend be produce this event produce another equally unknown till at last through a long succession the desire event be produce but if the original power be felt it must be know be it know its effect also must be know since all power be relative to its effect and vice versa if the effect be not know the power can not be know nor felt how indeed can we be conscious of a power to move our limbs when we have no such power but only that to move certain animal spirit which though they produce at last the motion of our limbs yet operate in such a manner as be wholly beyond our comprehension we may therefore conclude from the whole hope without any temerity though with assurance that our idea of power be not copy from any sentiment or consciousness of power within ourselves when we give rise to animal motion or apply our limbs to their proper use and office that their motion follow the command of the will be a matter of common experience like other natural events but the power or energy by which this be effect like that in other natural events be unknown and inconceivable shall we then assert that we be conscious of a power or energy in our own mind when by an act or command of our will we raise up a new idea fix the mind to the contemplation of it turn it on all side and at last dismiss it for some other idea when we think that we have survey it with sufficient accuracy believe the same arguments will prove that even this command of the will give us no real idea of force or energy first it must be allow that when we know a power we know that very circumstance in the cause by which it be enable to produce the effect for these be suppose to be synonimous we must therefore know both the cause and effect and the relation between them but do we pretend to be acquaint with the nature of the human soul and the nature of an idea or the aptitude of the one to produce the other this be a real creation a production of something out of nothing which imply a power so great that it may seem at first sight beyond the reach of any be less than infinite at least it must be own that such a power be not felt nor know nor even conceivable by the mind we only feel the event namely the existence of an idea consequent to a command of the will but the manner in which this operation be perform the power by which it be produce be entirely beyond our comprehension secondly the command of the mind over itself be limit as well as its command over the body and these limit be not know by reason or any acquaintance with the nature of cause and effect but only by experience and observation as in all other natural events and in the operation of external object our authority over our sentiments and passions be much weaker than that over our ideas and even the latter authority be circumscribe within very narrow boundaries will any one pretend to assign the ultimate reason of these boundaries or show why the power be deficient in one case not in another thirdly this selfcommand be very different at different time a man in health possess more of it than one languish with sickness we be more master of our thoughts in the morning than in the even fast than after a full meal can we give any reason for these variations except experience where then be the power of which we pretend to be conscious be there not here either in a spiritual or material substance or both some secret mechanism or structure of part upon which the effect depend and which be entirely unknown to us render the power or energy of the will equally unknown and incomprehensible volition be surely an act of the mind with which we be sufficiently acquaint reflect upon it consider it on all side do you find anything in it like this creative power by which it raise from nothing a new idea and with a kind of fiat imitate the omnipotence of its maker if may be allow so to speak who call forth into existence all the various scenes of nature so far from be conscious of this energy in the will it require as certain experience as that of which we be possess to convince us that such extraordinary effect do ever result from a simple act of volition the generality of mankind never find any difficulty in account for the more common and familiar operations of nature such as the descent of heavy body the growth of plant the generation of animals or the nourishment of body by food but suppose that in all these case they perceive the very force or energy of the cause by which it be connect with its effect and be for ever infallible in its operation they acquire by long habit such a turn of mind that upon the appearance of the cause they immediately expect with assurance its usual attendant and hardly conceive it possible that any other event could result from it it be only on the discovery of extraordinary phaenomena such as earthquakes pestilence and prodigies of any kind that they find themselves at a loss to assign a proper cause and to explain the manner in which the effect be produce by it it be usual for men in such difficulties to have recourse to some invisible intelligent principle as the immediate cause of that event which surprise them and which they think can not be account for from the common power of nature but philosophers who carry their scrutiny a little farther immediately perceive that even in the most familiar events the energy of the cause be as unintelligible as in the most unusual and that we only learn by experience the frequent conjunction of object without be ever able to comprehend anything like connexion between them here then many philosophers think themselves oblige by reason to have recourse on all occasion to the same principle which the vulgar never appeal to but in case that appear miraculous and supernatural they acknowledge mind and intelligence to be not only the ultimate and original cause of all things but the immediate and sole cause of every event which appear in nature they pretend that those object which be commonly denominate cause be in reality nothing but occasion and that the true and direct principle of every effect be not any power or force in nature but a volition of the supreme be who will that such particular object should for ever be conjoin with each other instead of say that one billiardball move another by a force which it have derive from the author of nature it be the deity himself they say who by a particular volition move the second ball be determine to this operation by the impulse of the first ball in consequence of those general laws which he have lay down to himself in the government of the universe but philosophers advance still in their inquiries discover that as we be totally ignorant of the power on which depend the mutual operation of body we be no less ignorant of that power on which depend the operation of mind on body or of body on mind nor be we able either from our sense or consciousness to assign the ultimate principle in one case more than in the other the same ignorance therefore reduce them to the same conclusion they assert that the deity be the immediate cause of the union between soul and body and that they be not the organs of sense which be agitate by external object produce sensations in the mind but that it be a particular volition of our omnipotent maker which excite such a sensation in consequence of such a motion in the organ in like manner it be not any energy in the will that produce local motion in our members it be god himself who be please to second our will in itself impotent and to command that motion which we erroneously attribute to our own power and efficacy nor do philosophers stop at this conclusion they sometimes extend the same inference to the mind itself in its internal operations our mental vision or conception of ideas be nothing but a revelation make to us by our maker when we voluntarily turn our thoughts to any object and raise up its image in the fancy it be not the will which create that idea it be the universal creator who discover it to the mind and render it present to us thus accord to these philosophers every thing be full of god not content with the principle that nothing exist but by his will that nothing possess any power but by his concession they rob nature and all create be of every power in order to render their dependence on the deity still more sensible and immediate they consider not that by this theory they diminish instead of magnify the grandeur of those attribute which they affect so much to celebrate it argue surely more power in the deity to delegate a certain degree of power to inferior creatures than to produce every thing by his own immediate volition it argue more wisdom to contrive at first the fabric of the world with such perfect foresight that of itself and by its proper operation it may serve all the purpose of providence than if the great creator be oblige every moment to adjust its part and animate by his breath all the wheel of that stupendous machine but if we would have a more philosophical confutation of this theory perhaps the two follow reflections may suffice first it seem to me that this theory of the universal energy and operation of the supreme be be too bold ever to carry conviction with it to a man sufficiently apprize of the weakness of human reason and the narrow limit to which it be confine in all its operations though the chain of arguments which conduct to it be ever so logical there must arise a strong suspicion if not an absolute assurance that it have carry us quite beyond the reach of our faculties when it lead to conclusions so extraordinary and so remote from common life and experience we be get into fairy land long ere we have reach the last step of our theory and there we have no reason to trust our common methods of argument or to think that our usual analogies and probabilities have any authority our line be too short to fathom such immense aby and however we may flatter ourselves that we be guide in every step which we take by a kind of verisimilitude and experience we may be assure that this fancy experience have no authority when we thus apply it to subject that lie entirely out of the sphere of experience but on this we shall have occasion to touch afterwards secondly can not perceive any force in the arguments on which this theory be found we be ignorant it be true of the manner in which body operate on each other their force or energy be entirely incomprehensible but be we not equally ignorant of the manner or force by which a mind even the supreme mind operate either on itself or on body whence beseech you do we acquire any idea of it we have no sentiment or consciousness of this power in ourselves we have no idea of the supreme be but what we learn from reflection on our own faculties be our ignorance therefore a good reason for reject anything we should be lead into that principle of deny all energy in the supreme be as much as in the grossest matter we surely comprehend as little the operations of one as of the other be it more difficult to conceive that motion may arise from impulse than that it may arise from volition all we know be our profound ignorance in both case part but to hasten to a conclusion of this argument which be already draw out to too great a length we have seek in vain for an idea of power or necessary connexion in all the source from which we could suppose it to be derive it appear that in single instance of the operation of body we never can by our utmost scrutiny discover anything but one event follow another without be able to comprehend any force or power by which the cause operate or any connexion between it and its suppose effect the same difficulty occur in contemplate the operations of mind on body where we observe the motion of the latter to follow upon the volition of the former but be not able to observe or conceive the tie which bind together the motion and volition or the energy by which the mind produce this effect the authority of the will over its own faculties and ideas be not a whit more comprehensible so that upon the whole there appear not throughout all nature any one instance of connexion which be conceivable by us all events seem entirely loose and separate one event follow another but we never can observe any tie between them they seem conjoin but never connect and as we can have no idea of any thing which never appear to our outward sense or inward sentiment the necessary conclusion seem to be that we have no idea of connexion or power at all and that these word be absolutely without any mean when employ either in philosophical reason or common life but there still remain one method of avoid this conclusion and one source which we have not yet examine when any natural object or event be present it be impossible for us by any sagacity or penetration to discover or even conjecture without experience what event will result from it or to carry our foresight beyond that object which be immediately present to the memory and sense even after one instance or experiment where we have observe a particular event to follow upon another we be not entitle to form a general rule or foretell what will happen in like case it be justly esteem an unpardonable temerity to judge of the whole course of nature from one single experiment however accurate or certain but when one particular species of event have always in all instance be conjoin with another we make no any scruple of foretell one upon the appearance of the other and of employ that reason which can alone assure us of any matter of fact or existence we then call the one object cause the other effect we suppose that there be some connexion between them some power in the one by which it infallibly produce the other and operate with the greatest certainty and strongest necessity it appear then that this idea of a necessary connexion among events arise from a number of similar instance which occur of the constant conjunction of these events nor can that idea ever be suggest by any one of these instance survey in all possible light and position but there be nothing in a number of instance different from every single instance which be suppose to be exactly similar except only that after a repetition of similar instance the mind be carry by habit upon the appearance of one event to expect its usual attendant and to believe that it will exist this connexion therefore which we feel in the mind this customary transition of the imagination from one object to its usual attendant be the sentiment or impression from which we form the idea of power or necessary connexion nothing farther be in the case contemplate the subject on all side you will never find any other origin of that idea this be the sole difference between one instance from which we can never receive the idea of connexion and a number of similar instance by which it be suggest the first time a man saw the communication of motion by impulse as by the shock of two billiard ball he could not pronounce that the one event be connect but only that it be conjoin with the other after he have observe several instance of this nature he then pronounce them to be connect what alteration have happen to give rise to this new idea of connexion nothing but that he now feel these events to be connect in his imagination and can readily foretell the existence of one from the appearance of the other when we say therefore that one object be connect with another we mean only that they have acquire a connexion in our think and give rise to this inference by which they become proof of each others existence a conclusion which be somewhat extraordinary but which seem found on sufficient evidence nor will its evidence be weaken by any general diffidence of the understand or sceptical suspicion concern every conclusion which be new and extraordinary no conclusions can be more agreeable to scepticism than such as make discoveries concern the weakness and narrow limit of human reason and capacity and what stronger instance can be produce of the surprise ignorance and weakness of the understand than the present for surely if there be any relation among object which it import to us to know perfectly it be that of cause and effect on this be found all our reason concern matter of fact or existence by mean of it alone we attain any assurance concern object which be remove from the present testimony of our memory and sense the only immediate utility of all sciences be to teach us how to control and regulate future events by their cause our thoughts and enquiries be therefore every moment employ about this relation yet so imperfect be the ideas which we form concern it that it be impossible to give any just definition of cause except what be draw from something extraneous and foreign to it similar object be always conjoin with similar of this we have experience suitably to this experience therefore we may define a cause to be an object follow by another and where all the object similar to the first be follow by object similar to the second or in other word where if the first object have not be the second never have exist the appearance of a cause always convey the mind by a customary transition to the idea of the effect of this also we have experience we may therefore suitably to this experience form another definition of cause and call it an object follow by another and whose appearance always convey the think to that other but though both these definitions be draw from circumstances foreign to the cause we can not remedy this inconvenience or attain any more perfect definition which may point out that circumstance in the cause which give it a connexion with its effect we have no idea of this connexion nor even any distinct notion what it be we desire to know when we endeavour at a conception of it we say for instance that the vibration of this string be the cause of this particular sound but what do we mean by that affirmation we either mean that this vibration be follow by this sound and that all similar vibrations have be follow by similar sound or that this vibration be follow by this sound and that upon the appearance of one the mind anticipate the sense and form immediately an idea of the other we may consider the relation of cause and effect in either of these two light but beyond these we have no idea of it as to the frequent use of the word force power energy c which every where occur in common conversation as well as in philosophy that be no proof that we be acquaint in any instance with the connect principle between cause and effect or can account ultimately for the production of one thing to another these word as commonly use have very loose mean annex to them and their ideas be very uncertain and confuse no animal can put external body in motion without the sentiment of a nisus or endeavour and every animal have a sentiment or feel from the stroke or blow of an external object that be in motion these sensations which be merely animal and from which we can a priori draw no inference we be apt to transfer to inanimate object and to suppose that they have some such feel whenever they transfer or receive motion with regard to energies which be exert without our annex to them any idea of communicate motion we consider only the constant experience conjunction of the events and as we feel a customary connexion between the ideas we transfer that feel to the object as nothing be more usual than to apply to external body every internal sensation which they occasion to recapitulate therefore the reason of this section every idea be copy from some precede impression or sentiment and where we can not find any impression we may be certain that there be no idea in all single instance of the operation of body or mind there be nothing that produce any impression nor consequently can suggest any idea of power or necessary connexion but when many uniform instance appear and the same object be always follow by the same event we then begin to entertain the notion of cause and connexion we then feel a new sentiment or impression to wit a customary connexion in the think or imagination between one object and its usual attendant and this sentiment be the original of that idea which we seek for for as this idea arise from a number of similar instance and not from any single instance it must arise from that circumstance in which the number of instance differ from every individual instance but this customary connexion or transition of the imagination be the only circumstance in which they differ in every other particular they be alike the first instance which we saw of motion communicate by the shock of two billiard ball to return to this obvious illustration be exactly similar to any instance that may at present occur to us except only that we could not at first infer one event from the other which we be enable to do at present after so long a course of uniform experience know not whether the reader will readily apprehend this reason be afraid that should multiply word about it or throw it into a greater variety of light it would only become more obscure and intricate in all abstract reason there be one point of view which if we can happily hit we shall go farther towards illustrate the subject than by all the eloquence and copious expression in the world this point of view we should endeavour to reach and reserve the flower of rhetoric for subject which be more adapt to them sect of liberty and necessity part it might reasonably be expect in question which have be canvass and dispute with great eagerness since the first origin of science and philosophy that the mean of all the term at least should have be agree upon among the disputants and our enquiries in the course of two thousand years be able to pass from word to the true and real subject of the controversy for how easy may it seem to give exact definitions of the term employ in reason and make these definitions not the mere sound of word the object of future scrutiny and examination but if we consider the matter more narrowly we shall be apt to draw a quite opposite conclusion from this circumstance alone that a controversy have be long keep on foot and remain still undecided we may presume that there be some ambiguity in the expression and that the disputants affix different ideas to the term employ in the controversy for as the faculties of the mind be suppose to be naturally alike in every individual otherwise nothing could be more fruitless than to reason or dispute together it be impossible if men affix the same ideas to their term that they could so long form different opinions of the same subject especially when they communicate their view and each party turn themselves on all side in search of arguments which may give them the victory over their antagonists it be true if men attempt the discussion of question which lie entirely beyond the reach of human capacity such as those concern the origin of worlds or the economy of the intellectual system or region of spirit they may long beat the air in their fruitless contest and never arrive at any determinate conclusion but if the question regard any subject of common life and experience nothing one would think could preserve the dispute so long undecided but some ambiguous expressions which keep the antagonists still at a distance and hinder them from grapple with each other this have be the case in the long dispute question concern liberty and necessity and to so remarkable a degree that if be not much mistake we shall find that all mankind both learn and ignorant have always be of the same opinion with regard to this subject and that a few intelligible definitions would immediately have put an end to the whole controversy own that this dispute have be so much canvass on all hand and have lead philosophers into such a labyrinth of obscure sophistry that it be no wonder if a sensible reader indulge his ease so far as to turn a deaf ear to the proposal of such a question from which he can expect neither instruction or entertainment but the state of the argument here propose may perhaps serve to renew his attention as it have more novelty promise at least some decision of the controversy and will not much disturb his ease by any intricate or obscure reason hope therefore to make it appear that all men have ever agree in the doctrine both of necessity and of liberty accord to any reason able sense which can be put on these term and that the whole controversy have hitherto turn merely upon word we shall begin with examine the doctrine of necessity it be universally allow that matter in all its operations be actuate by a necessary force and that every natural effect be so precisely determine by the energy of its cause that no other effect in such particular circumstances could possibly have result from it the degree and direction of every motion be by the laws of nature prescribe with such exactness that a live creature may as soon arise from the shock of two body in motion in any other degree or direction than what be actually produce by it would we therefore form a just and precise idea of necessity we must consider whence that idea arise when we apply it to the operation of body it seem evident that if all the scenes of nature be continually shift in such a manner that no two events bore any resemblance to each other but every object be entirely new without any similitude to whatever have be see before we should never in that case have attain the least idea of necessity or of a connexion among these object we might say upon such a supposition that one object or event have follow another not that one be produce by the other the relation of cause and effect must be utterly unknown to mankind inference and reason concern the operations of nature would from that moment be at an end and the memory and sense remain the only canal by which the knowledge of any real existence could possibly have access to the mind our idea therefore of necessity and causation arise entirely from the uniformity observable in the operations of nature where similar object be constantly conjoin together and the mind be determine by custom to infer the one from the appearance of the other these two circumstances form the whole of that necessity which we ascribe to matter beyond the constant conjunction of similar object and the consequent inference from one to the other we have no notion of any necessity or connexion if it appear therefore that all mankind have ever allow without any doubt or hesitation that these two circumstances take place in the voluntary action of men and in the operations of mind it must follow that all mankind have ever agree in the doctrine of necessity and that they have hitherto dispute merely for not understand each other as to the first circumstance the constant and regular conjunction of similar events we may possibly satisfy ourselves by the follow ing considerations it be universally acknowledge that there be a great uniformity among the action of men in all nations and age and that human nature remain still the same in its principles and operations the same motives always produce the same action the same events follow from the same cause ambition avarice selflove vanity friendship generosity public spirit these passions mix in various degrees and distribute through society have be from the begin of the world and still be the source of all the action and enterprises which have ever be observe among mankind would you know the sentiments inclinations and course of life of the greeks and romans study well the temper and action of the french and english you can not be much mistake in transfer to the former most of the observations which you have make with regard to the latter mankind be so much the same in all time and place that history inform us of nothing new or strange in this particular its chief use be only to discover the constant and universal principles of human nature by show men in all varieties of circumstances and situations and furnish us with materials from which we may form our observations and become acquaint with the regular spring of human action and behaviour these record of war intrigue factions and revolutions be so many collections of experiment by which the politician or moral philosopher fix the principles of his science in the same manner as the physician or natural philosopher become acquaint with the nature of plant minerals and other external object by the experiment which he form concern them nor be the earth water and other elements examine by aristotle and hippocrates more like to those which at present lie under our observation than the men describe by polybius and tacitus be to those who now govern the world should a traveller return from a far country bring us an account of men wholly different from any with whom we be ever acquaint men who be entirely divest of avarice ambition or revenge who know no pleasure but friendship generosity and public spirit we should immediately from these circumstances detect the falsehood and prove him a liar with the same certainty as if he have stuff his narration with stories of centaurs and dragons miracles and prodigies and if we would explode any forgery in history we can not make use of a more convince argument than to prove that the action ascribe to any person be directly contrary to the course of nature and that no human motives in such circumstances could ever induce him to such a conduct the veracity of quintus curtius be as much to be suspect when he describe the supernatural courage of alexander by which he be hurry on singly to attack multitudes as when he describe his supernatural force and activity by which he be able to resist them so readily and universally do we acknowledge a uniformity in human motives and action as well as in the operations of body hence likewise the benefit of that experience acquire by long life and a variety of business and company in order to instruct us in the principles of human nature and regulate our future conduct as well as speculation by mean of this guide we mount up to the knowledge of mens inclinations and motives from their action expressions and even gesture and again descend to the interpretation of their action from our knowledge of their motives and inclinations the general observations treasure up by a course of experience give us the clue of human nature and teach us to unravel all its intricacies pretexts and appearances no longer deceive us public declarations pass for the specious colour of a cause and though virtue and honour be allow their proper weight and authority that perfect disinterestedness so often pretend to be never expect in multitudes and party seldom in their leaders and scarcely even in individuals of any rank or station but be there no uniformity in human action and be every experiment which we could form of this kind irregular and anomalous it be impossible to collect any general observations concern mankind and no experience however accurately digest by reflection would ever serve to any purpose why be the age husbandman more skilful in his call than the young beginner but because there be a certain uniformity in the operation of the sun rain and earth towards the production of vegetables and experience teach the old practitioner the rule by which this operation be govern and direct we must not however expect that this uniformity of human action should be carry to such a length as that all men in the same circumstances will always act precisely in the same manner without make any allowance for the diversity of character prejudice and opinions such a uniformity in every particular be find in no part of nature on the contrary from observe the variety of conduct in different men we be enable to form a greater variety of maxims which still suppose a degree of uniformity and regularity be the manners of men different in different age and countries we learn thence the great force of custom and education which mould the human mind from its infancy and form it into a fix and establish character be the behaviour and conduct of the one sex very unlike that of the other be it thence we become acquaint with the different character which nature have impress upon the sex and which she preserve with constancy and regularity be the action of the same person much diversify in the different periods of his life from infancy to old age this afford room for many general observations concern the gradual change of our sentiments and inclinations and the different maxims which prevail in the different age of human creatures even the character which be peculiar to each individual have a uniformity in their influence otherwise our acquaintance with the persons and our observation of their conduct could never teach us their dispositions or serve to direct our behaviour with regard to them grant it possible to find some action which seem to have no regular connexion with any know motives and be exceptions to all the measure of conduct which have ever be establish for the government of men but if we would willingly know what judgement should be form of such irregular and extraordinary action we may consider the sentiments commonly entertain with regard to those irregular events which appear in the course of nature and the operations of external object all cause be not conjoin to their usual effect with like uniformity an artificer who handle only dead matter may be disappoint of his aim as well as the politician who direct the conduct of sensible and intelligent agents the vulgar who take things accord to their first appearance attribute the uncertainty of events to such an uncertainty in the cause as make the latter often fail of their usual influence though they meet with no impediment in their operation but philosophers observe that almost in every part of nature there be contain a vast variety of spring and principles which be hide by reason of their minuteness or remoteness find that it be at least possible the contrariety of events may not proceed from any contingency in the cause but from the secret operation of contrary cause this possibility be convert into certainty by farther observation when they remark that upon an exact scrutiny a contrariety of effect always betray a contrariety of cause and proceed from their mutual opposition a peasant can give no better reason for the stop of any clock or watch than to say that it do not commonly go right but an artist easily perceive that the same force in the spring or pendulum have always the same influence on the wheel but fail of its usual effect perhaps by reason of a grain of dust which put a stop to the whole movement from the observation of several parallel instance philosophers form a maxim that the connexion between all cause and effect be equally necessary and that its seem uncertainty in some instance proceed from the secret opposition of contrary cause thus for instance in the human body when the usual symptoms of health or sickness disappoint our expectation when medicine operate not with their wonted power when irregular events follow from any particular cause the philosopher and physician be not surprise at the matter nor be ever tempt to deny in general the necessity and uniformity of those principles by which the animal economy be conduct they know that a human body be a mighty complicate machine that many secret power lurk in it which be altogether beyond our comprehension that to us it must often appear very uncertain in its operations and that therefore the irregular events which outwardly discover themselves can be no proof that the laws of nature be not observe with the greatest regularity in its internal operations and government the philosopher if he be consistent must apply the same reason to the action and volitions of intelligent agents the most irregular and unexpected resolutions of men may frequently be account for by those who know every particular circumstance of their character and situation a person of an oblige disposition give a peevish answer but he have the toothache or have not din a stupid fellow discover an uncommon alacrity in his carriage but he have meet with a sudden piece of good fortune or even when an action as sometimes happen can not be particularly account for either by the person himself or by others we know in general that the character of men be to a certain degree inconstant and irregular this be in a manner the constant character of human nature though it be applicable in a more particular manner to some persons who have no fix rule for their conduct but proceed in a continue course of caprice and inconstancy the internal principles and motives may operate in a uniform manner notwithstanding these seem irregularities in the same manner as the wind rain cloud and other variations of the weather be suppose to be govern by steady principles though not easily discoverable by human sagacity and enquiry thus it appear not only that the conjunction between motives and voluntary action be as regular and uniform as that between the cause and effect in any part of nature but also that this regular conjunc tion have be universally acknowledge among mankind and have never be the subject of dispute either in philosophy or common life now as it be from past experience that we draw all inferences concern the future and as we conclude that object will always be conjoin together which we find to have always be conjoin it may seem superfluous to prove that this experience uniformity in human action be a source whence we draw inferences concern them but in order to throw the argument into a greater variety of light we shall also insist though briefly on this latter topic the mutual dependence of men be so great in all societies that scarce any human action be entirely complete in itself or be perform without some reference to the action of others which be requisite to make it answer fully the intention of the agent the poorest artificer who labour alone expect at least the protection of the magistrate to ensure him the enjoyment of the fruit of his labour he also expect that when he carry his goods to market and offer them at a reasonable price he shall find purchasers and shall be able by the money he acquire to engage others to supply him with those commodities which be requisite for his subsistence in proportion as men extend their deal and render their intercourse with others more complicate they always comprehend in their scheme of life a greater variety of voluntary action which they expect from the proper motives to cooperate with their own in all these conclusions they take their measure from past experience in the same manner as in their reason concern external object and firmly believe that men as well as all the elements be to continue in their operations the same that they have ever find them a manufacturer reckon upon the labour of his servants for the execution of any work as much as upon the tool which he employ and would be equally surprise be his expectations disappoint in short this experimental inference and reason concern the action of others enter so much into human life that no man while awake be ever a moment without employ it have we not reason therefore to affirm that all mankind have always agree in the doctrine of necessity accord to the forego definition and explication of it nor have philosophers ever entertain a different opinion from the people in this particular for not to mention that almost every action of their life suppose that opinion there be even few of the speculative part of learn to which it be not essential what would become of history have we not a dependence on the veracity of the historian accord ing to the experience which we have have of mankind how could politics be a science if laws and form of government have not a uniform influence upon society where would be the foundation of morals if particular character have no certain or determinate power to produce particular sentiments and if these sentiments have no constant operation on action and with what pretence could we employ our criticism upon any poet or polite author if we could not pronounce the conduct and sentiments of his actors either natural or unnatural to such character and in such circumstances it seem almost impossible therefore to engage either in science or action of any kind without acknowledge the doctrine of necessity and this inference from motive to voluntary action from character to conduct and indeed when we consider how aptly natural and moral evidence link together and form only one chain of argument we shall make no scruple to allow that they be of the same nature and derive from the same principles a prisoner who have neither money nor interest discover the impossibility of his escape as well when he consider the obstinacy of the gaoler as the wall and bar with which he be surround and in all attempt for his freedom choose rather to work upon the stone and iron of the one than upon the inflexible nature of the other the same prisoner when conduct to the scaffold foresee his death as certainly from the constancy and fidelity of his guard as from the operation of the axe or wheel his mind run along a certain train of ideas the refusal of the soldier to consent to his escape the action of the executioner the separation of the head and body bleed convulsive motion and death here be a connect chain of natural cause and voluntary action but the mind feel no difference between them in pass from one link to another nor be less certain of the future event than if it be connect with the object present to the memory or sense by a train of cause cement together by what we be please to call a physical necessity the same experience union have the same effect on the mind whether the unite object be motives volition and action or figure and motion we may change the name of things but their nature and their operation on the understand never change be a man whom know to be honest and opulent and with whom live in intimate friendship to come into my house where be surround with my servants rest assure that he be not to stab me before he leave it in order to rob me of my silver standish and no more suspect this event than the fall of the house itself which be new and solidly build and found but he may have be seize with a sudden and unknown frenzy so may a sudden earthquake arise and shake and tumble my house about my ears shall therefore change the suppositions shall say that know with certainty that he be not to put his hand into the fire and hold it there till it be consume and this event think can foretell with the same assurance as that if he throw himself out at the window and meet with no obstruction he will not remain a moment suspend in the air no suspicion of an unknown frenzy can give the least possibility to the former event which be so contrary to all the know principles of human nature a man who at noon leave his purse full of gold on the pavement at char cross may as well expect that it will fly away like a feather as that he will find it untouched an hour after above one half of human reason contain inferences of a similar nature attend with more or less degrees of certainty proportion to our experience of the usual conduct of mankind in such particular situations have frequently consider what could possibly be the reason why all mankind though they have ever without hesitation acknowledge the doctrine of necessity in their whole practice and reason have yet discover such a reluctance to acknowledge it in word and have rather show a propensity in all age to profess the contrary opinion the matter think may be account for after the follow manner if we examine the operations of body and the production of effect from their cause we shall find that all our faculties can never carry us farther in our knowledge of this relation than barely to observe that particular object be constantly conjoin together and that the mind be carry by a customary transition from the appearance of one to the belief of the other but though this conclusion concern human ignorance be the result of the strictest scrutiny of this subject men still entertain a strong propensity to believe that they penetrate farther into the power of nature and perceive something like a necessary connexion between the cause and the effect when again they turn their reflections towards the operations of their own mind and feel no such connexion of the motive and the action they be thence apt to suppose that there be a difference between the effect which result from material force and those which arise from think and intelligence but be once convince that we know nothing farther of causation of any kind than merely the constant conjunction of object and the consequent inference of the mind from one to another and find that these two circumstances be universally allow to have place in voluntary action we may be more easily lead to own the same necessity common to all cause and though this reason may contradict the systems of many philosophers in ascribe necessity to the determinations of the will we shall find upon reflection that they dissent from it in word only not in their real sentiment necessity accord to the sense in which it be here take have never yet be reject nor can ever think be reject by any philosopher it may only perhaps be pretend that the mind can perceive in the operations of matter some farther connexion between the cause and effect and connexion that have not place in voluntary action of intelligent be now whether it be so or not can only appear upon examination and it be incumbent on these philosophers to make good their assertion by define or describe that necessity and point it out to us in the operations of material cause it would seem indeed that men begin at the wrong end of this question concern liberty and necessity when they enter upon it by examine the faculties of the soul the influence of the understand and the operations of the will let them first discuss a more simple question namely the operations of body and of brute unintelligent matter and try whether they can there form any idea of causation and necessity except that of a constant conjunction of object and subsequent inference of the mind from one to another if these circumstances form in reality the whole of that necessity which we conceive in matter and if these circumstances be also universally acknowledge to take place in the operations of the mind the dispute be at an end at least must be own to be thenceforth merely verbal but as long as we will rashly suppose that we have some farther idea of necessity and causation in the operations of external object at the same time that we can find nothing farther in the voluntary action of the mind there be no possibility of bring the question to any determinate issue while we proceed upon so erroneous a supposition the only method of undeceive us be to mount up higher to examine the narrow extent of science when apply to material cause and to convince ourselves that all we know of them be the constant conjunction and inference above mention we may perhaps find that it be with difficulty we be induce to fix such narrow limit to human understand but we can afterwards find no difficulty when we come to apply this doctrine to the action of the will for as it be evident that these have a regular conjunction with motives and circumstances and character and as we always draw inferences from one to the other we must be oblige to acknowledge in word that necessity which we have already avow in every deliberation of our live and in every step of our conduct and behaviour but to proceed in this reconcile project with regard to the question of liberty and necessity the most contentious question of metaphysics the most contentious science it will not require many word to prove that all mankind have ever agree in the doctrine of liberty as well as in that of necessity and that the whole dispute in this respect also have be hitherto merely verbal for what be mean by liberty when apply to voluntary action we can not surely mean that action have so little connexion with motives inclinations and circumstances that one do not follow with a certain degree of uniformity from the other and that one afford no inference by which we can conclude the existence of the other for these be plain and acknowledge matter of fact by liberty then we can only mean a power of act or not act accord to the determinations of the will that be if we choose to remain at rest we may if we choose to move we also may now this hypothetical liberty be universally allow to belong to every one who be not a prisoner and in chain here then be no subject of dispute whatever definition we may give of liberty we should be careful to observe two requisite circumstances first that it be consistent with plain matter of fact secondly that it be consistent with itself if we observe these circumstances and render our definition intelligible be persuade that all mankind will be find of one opinion with regard to it it be universally allow that nothing exist without a cause of its existence and that chance when strictly examine be a mere negative word and mean not any real power which have anywhere a be in nature but it be pretend that some cause be necessary some not necessary here then be the advantage of definitions let any one define a cause without comprehend as a part of the definition a necessary connexion with its effect and let him show distinctly the origin of the idea express by the definition and shall readily give up the whole controversy but if the forego explication of the matter be receive this must be absolutely impracticable have not object a regular conjunction with each other we should never have entertain any notion of cause and effect and this regular conjunction produce that inference of the understand which be the only connexion that we can have any comprehension of whoever attempt a definition of cause exclusive of these circumstances will be oblige either to employ unintelligible term or such as be synonymous to the term which he endeavour to define and if the definition above mention be admit liberty when oppose to necessity not to constraint be the same thing with chance which be universally allow to have no existence part there be no method of reason more common and yet none more blameable than in philosophical dispute to endeavour the refutation of any hypothesis by a pretence of its dangerous consequences to religion and morality when any opinion lead to absurdities it be certainly false but it be not certain that an opinion be false because it be of dangerous consequence such topics therefore ought entirely to be forbear as serve nothing to the discovery of truth but only to make the person of an antagonist odious this observe in general without pretend to draw any advantage from it frankly submit to an examination of this kind and shall venture to affirm that the doctrines both of necessity and of liberty as above explain be not only consistent with morality but be absolutely essential to its support necessity may be define two ways conformably to the two definitions of cause of which it make an essential part it consist either in the constant conjunction of like object or in the inference of the understand from one object to another now necessity in both these sense which indeed be at bottom the same have universally though tacitly in the school in the pulpit and in common life be allow to belong to the will of man and no one have ever pretend to deny that we can draw inferences concern human action and that those inferences be found on the experience union of like action with like motives inclinations and circumstances the only particular in which any one can differ be that either perhaps he will refuse to give the name of necessity to this property of human action but as long as the mean be understand hope the word can do no harm or that he will maintain it possible to discover something farther in the operations of matter but this it must be acknowledge can be of no consequence to morality or religion whatever it may be to natural philosophy or metaphysics we may here be mistake in assert that there be no idea of any other necessity or connexion in the action of body but surely we ascribe nothing to the action of the mind but what everyone do and must readily allow of we change no circumstance in the receive orthodox system with regard to the will but only in that with regard to material object and cause nothing therefore can be more innocent at least than this doctrine all laws be found on reward and punishments it be suppose as a fundamental principle that these motives have a regular and uniform influence on the mind and both produce the good and prevent the evil action we may give to this influence what name we please but as it be usually conjoin with the action it must be esteem a cause and be look upon as an instance of that necessity which we would here establish the only proper object of hatred or vengeance be a person or creature endow with think and consciousness and when any criminal or injurious action excite that passion it be only by their relation to the person or connexion with him action be by their very nature temporary and perish and where they proceed not from some cause in the character and disposition of the person who perform them they can neither redound to his honour if good nor infamy if evil the action themselves may be blameable they may be contrary to all the rule of morality and religion but the person be not answerable for them and as they proceed from nothing in him that be durable and constant and leave nothing of that nature behind them it be impossible he can upon their account become the object of punishment or vengeance accord to the principle therefore which deny necessity and consequently cause a man be as pure and untainted after have commit the most horrid crime as at the first moment of his birth nor be his character anywise concern in his action since they be not derive from it and the wickedness of the one can never be use as a proof of the depravity of the other men be not blame for such action as they perform ignorantly and casually whatever may be the consequences why but because the principles of these action be only momentary and terminate in them alone men be less blame for such action as they perform hastily and unpremeditately than for such as proceed from deliberation for what reason but because a hasty temper though a constant cause or principle in the mind operate only by intervals and infect not the whole character again repentance wipe off every crime if attend with a reformation of life and manners how be this to be account for but by assert that action render a person criminal merely as they be proof of criminal principles in the mind and when by an alteration of these principles they cease to be just proof they likewise cease to be criminal but except upon the doctrine of necessity they never be just proof and consequently never be criminal it will be equally easy to prove and from the same arguments that liberty accord to that definition above mention in which all men agree be also essential to morality and that no human action where it be want be susceptible of any moral qualities or can be the object either of approbation or dislike for as action be object of our moral sentiment so far only as they be indications of the internal character passions and affections it be impossible that they can give rise either to praise or blame where they proceed not from these principles but be derive altogether from external violence pretend not to have obviate or remove all objections to this theory with regard to necessity and liberty can foresee other objections derive from topics which have not here be treat of it may be say for instance that if voluntary action be subject to the same laws of necessity with the operations of matter there be a continue chain of necessary cause preordain and predetermine reach from the original cause of all to every single volition of every human creature no contingency anywhere in the universe no indifference no liberty while we act we be at the same time act upon the ultimate author of all our volitions be the creator of the world who first bestow motion on this immense machine and place all be in that particular position whence every subsequent event by an inevitable necessity must result human action therefore either can have no moral turpitude at all as proceed from so good a cause or if they have any turpitude they must involve our creator in the same guilt while he be acknowledge to be their ultimate cause and author for as a man who fire a mine be answerable for all the consequences whether the train he employ be long or short so wherever a continue chain of necessary cause be fix that be either finite or infinite who produce the first be likewise the author of all the rest and must both bear the blame and acquire the praise which belong to them our clear and unalterable ideas of morality establish this rule upon unquestionable reason when we examine the consequences of any human action and these reason must still have greater force when apply to the volitions and intentions of a be infinitely wise and powerful ignorance or importence may be plead for so limit a creature as man but those imperfections have no place in our creator he foresee he ordain he intend all those action of men which we so rashly pronounce criminal and we must therefore conclude either that they be not criminal or that the deity not man be accountable for them but as either of these position be absurd and impious it follow that the doctrine from which they be deduce can not possibly be true as be liable to all the same objections an absurd consequence if necessary prove the original doctrine to be absurd in the same manner as criminal action render criminal the original cause if the connexion between them be necessary and evitable this objection consist of two part which we shall examine separately first that if human action can be trace up by a necessary chain to the deity they can never be criminal on account of the infinite perfection of that be from whom they be derive and who can intend nothing but what be altogether good and laudable or secondly if they be criminal we must retract the attribute of perfection which we ascribe to the deity and must acknowledge him to be the ultimate author of guilt and moral turpitude in all his creatures the answer to the first objection seem obvious and convince there be many philosophers who after an exact scrutiny of all the phenomena of nature conclude that the whole consider as one system be in every period of its existence order with perfect benevolence and that the utmost possible happiness will in the end result to all create be without any mixture of positive or absolute ill or misery every physical ill say they make an essential part of this benevolent system and could not possibly be remove even by the deity himself consider as a wise agent without give entrance to greater ill or exclude greater good which will result from it from this theory some philosophers and the ancient stoics among the rest derive a topic of consolation under all afflictions while they teach their pupils that those ills under which they labour be in reality goods to the universe and that to an enlarge view which could comprehend the whole system of nature every event become an object of joy and exultation but though this topic be specious and sublime it be soon find in practice weak and ineffectual you would surely more irritate than appease a man lie under the rack pain of the gout by preach up to him the rectitude of those general laws which produce the malignant humour in his body and lead them through the proper canal to the sinews and nerve where they now excite such acute torment these enlarge view may for a moment please the imagination of a speculative man who be place in ease and security but neither can they dwell with constancy on his mind even though undisturbed by the emotions of pain or passion much less can they maintain their grind when attack by such powerful antagonists the affections take a narrower and more natural survey of their object and by an economy more suitable to the infirmity of human mind regard alone the be around us and be actuate by such events as appear good or ill to the private system the case be the same with moral as with physical ill it can not reasonably be suppose that those remote considerations which be find of so little efficacy with regard to one will have a more powerful influence with regard to the other the mind of man be so form by nature that upon the appearance of certain character dispositions and action it immediately feel the sentiment of approbation or blame nor be there any emotions more essential to its frame and constitution the character which engage our approbation be chiefly such as contribute to the peace and security of human society as the character which excite blame be chiefly such as tend to public detriment and disturbance whence it may reasonably be presume that the moral sentiments arise either mediately or immediately from a reflection of these opposite interest what though philosophical meditations establish a different opinion or conjecture that everything be right with regard to the whole and that the qualities which disturb society be in the main as beneficial and be as suitable to the primary intention of nature as those which more directly promote its happiness and welfare be such remote and uncertain speculations able to counterbalance the sentiments which arise from the natural and immediate view of the object a man who be rob of a considerable sum do he find his vexation for the loss anywise diminish by these sublime reflections why then should his moral resentment against the crime be suppose incompatible with them or why should not the acknowledgement of a real distinction between vice and virtue be reconcileable to all speculative systems of philosophy as well as that of a real distinction between personal beauty and deformity both these distinctions be found in the natural sentiments of the human mind and these sentiments be not to be controuled or alter by any philosophical theory or speculation whatsoever the second objection admit not of so easy and satisfactory an answer nor be it possible to explain distinctly how the deity can be the mediate cause of all the action of men without be the author of sin and moral turpitude these be mysteries which mere natural and unas sisted reason be very unfit to handle and whatever system she embrace she must find herself involve in inextricable difficulties and even contradictions at every step which she take with regard to such subject to reconcile the indifference and contingency of human action with prescience or to defend absolute decree and yet free the deity from be the author of sin have be find hitherto to exceed all the power of philosophy happy if she be thence sensible of her temerity when she pry into these sublime mysteries and leave a scene so full of obscurities and perplexities return with suitable modesty to her true and proper province the examination of common life where she will find difficulties enough to employ her enquiries without launch into so boundless an ocean of doubt uncertainty and contradiction sect of the reason of animals all our reason concern matter of fact be found on a species of analogy which lead us to expect from any cause the same events which we have observe to result from similar cause where the cause be entirely similar the analogy be perfect and the inference draw from it be regard as certain and conclusive nor do any man ever entertain a doubt where he see a piece of iron that it will have weight and cohesion of part as in all other instance which have ever fall under his observation but where the object have not so exact a similarity the analogy be less perfect and the inference be less conclusive though still it have some force in proportion to the degree of similarity and resemblance the anatomical observations form upon one animal be by this species of reason extend to all animals and it be certain that when the circulation of the blood for instance be clearly prove to have place in one creature as a frog or fish it form a strong presumption that the same principle have place in all these analogical observations may be carry farther even to this science of which we be now treat and any theory by which we explain the operations of the understand or the origin and connexion of the passions in man will acquire additional authority if we find that the same theory be requisite to explain the same phenomena in all other animals we shall make trial of this with regard to the hypothesis by which we have in the forego discourse endeavour to account for all experimental reason and it be hop that this new point of view will serve to confirm all our former observations first it seem evident that animals as well as men learn many things from experience and infer that the same events will always follow from the same cause by this principle they become acquaint with the more obvious properties of external object and gradually from their birth treasure up a knowledge of the nature of fire water earth stone heights depths c and of the effect which result from their operation the ignorance and inexperience of the young be here plainly distinguishable from the cunning and sagacity of the old who have learn by long observation to avoid what hurt them and to pursue what give ease or pleasure a horse that have be accustom to the field become acquaint with the proper height which he can leap and will never attempt what exceed his force and ability an old greyhound will trust the more fatigue part of the chace to the younger and will place himself so as to meet the hare in her double nor be the conjecture which he form on this occasion found in any thing but his observation and experience this be still more evident from the effect of discipline and education on animals who by the proper application of reward and punishments may be teach any course of action and most contrary to their natural instincts and propensities be it not experience which render a dog apprehensive of pain when you menace him or lift up the whip to beat him be be not even experience which make him answer to his name and infer from such an arbitrary sound that you mean him rather than any of his fellows and intend to call him when you pronounce it in a certain manner and with a certain tone and accent in all these case we may observe that the animal infer some fact beyond what immediately strike his sense and that this inference be altogether found on past experience while the creature expect from the present object the same consequences which it have always find in its observation to result from similar object secondly it be impossible that this inference of the animal can be found on any process of argument or reason by which he conclude that like events must follow like object and that the course of nature will always be regular in its operations for if there be in reality any arguments of this nature they surely lie too abstruse for the observation of such imperfect understand since it may well employ the utmost care and attention of a philosophic genius to discover and observe them animals therefore be not guide in these inferences by reason neither be children neither be the generality of mankind in their ordinary action and conclusions neither be philosophers them selves who in all the active part of life be in the main the same with the vulgar and be govern by the same maxims nature must have provide some other principle of more ready and more general use and application nor can an operation of such immense consequence in life as that of infer effect from cause be trust to the uncertain process of reason and argumentation be this doubtful with regard to men it seem to admit of no question with regard to the brute creation and the conclusion be once firmly establish in the one we have a strong presumption from all the rule of analogy that it ought to be universally admit without any exception or reserve it be custom alone which engage animals from every object that strike their sense to infer its usual attendant and carry their imagination from the appearance of the one to conceive the other in that particular manner which we denominate belief no other explication can be give of this operation in all the higher as well as lower class of sensitive be which fall under our notice and observation we shall here endeavour briefly to explain the great difference in human understand after which the reason of the difference between men and animals will easily be comprehend when we have live any time and have be accustom to the uniformity of nature we acquire a general habit by which we always transfer the know to the unknown and conceive the latter to resemble the former by mean of this general habitual principle we regard even one experiment as the foundation of reason and expect a similar event with some degree of certainty where the experiment have be make accurately and free from all foreign circumstances it be therefore consider as a matter of great importance to observe the consequences of things and as one man may very much surpass another in attention and memory and observation this will make a very great difference in their reason where there be a complication of cause to produce any effect one mind may be much larger than another and better able to comprehend the whole system of object and to infer justly their consequences one man be able to carry on a chain of consequences to a greater length than another few men can think long without run into a confusion of ideas and mistake one for another and there be various degrees of this infirmity the circumstance on which the effect depend be frequently in volved in other circumstances which be foreign and extrinsic the separation of it often require great attention accuracy and subtilty the form of general maxims from particular observation be a very nice operation and nothing be more usual from haste or a narrowness of mind which see not on all side than to commit mistake in this particular when we reason from analogies the man who have the greater experience or the greater promptitude of suggest analogies will be the better reasoner byasses from prejudice education passion party c hang more upon one mind than another after we have acquire a confidence in human testimony book and conversation enlarge much more the sphere of one man experience and think than those of another it would be easy to discover many other circumstances that make a difference in the understand of men but though animals learn many part of their knowledge from observation there be also many part of it which they derive from the original hand of nature which much exceed the share of capacity they possess on ordinary occasion and in which they improve little or nothing by the longest practice and experience these we denominate instincts and be so apt to admire as something very extraordinary and inexplicable by all the disquisitions of human understand but our wonder will perhaps cease or diminish when we consider that the experimental reason itself which we possess in common with beasts and on which the whole conduct of life depend be nothing but a species of instinct or mechanical power that act in us unknown to ourselves and in its chief operations be not direct by any such relations or comparisons of ideas as be the proper object of our intellectual faculties though the instinct be different yet still it be an instinct which teach a man to avoid the fire as much as that which teach a bird with such exactness the art of incubation and the whole economy and order of its nursery sect of miracles part there be in dr tillotsons write an argument against the real presence which be as concise and elegant and strong as any argument can possibly be suppose against a doctrine so little worthy of a serious refutation it be acknowledge on all hand say that learn prelate that the authority either of the scripture or of tradition be found merely in the testimony of the apostles who be eyewitness to those miracles of our saviour by which he prove his divine mission our evidence then for the truth of the christian religion be less than the evidence for the truth of our sense because even in the first author of our religion it be no greater and it be evident it must diminish in pass from them to their disciples nor can any one rest such confidence in their testimony as in the immediate object of his sense but a weaker evidence can never destroy a stronger and therefore be the doctrine of the real presence ever so clearly reveal in scripture it be directly contrary to the rule of just reason to give our assent to it it contradict sense though both the scripture and tradition on which it be suppose to be build carry not such evidence with them as sense when they be consider merely as external evidence and be not bring home to every ones breast by the immediate operation of the holy spirit nothing be so convenient as a decisive argument of this kind which must at least silence the most arrogant bigotry and superstition and free us from their impertinent solicitations flatter myself that have discover an argument of a like nature which if just will with the wise and learn be an everlasting check to all kinds of superstitious delusion and consequently will be useful as long as the world endure for so long presume will the account of miracles and prodigies be find in all history sacred and profane though experience be our only guide in reason concern matter of fact it must be acknowledge that this guide be not altogether infallible but in some case be apt to lead us into errors one who in our climate should expect better weather in any week of june than in one of december would reason justly and conformably to experience but it be certain that he may happen in the event to find himself mistake however we may observe that in such a case he would have no cause to complain of experience because it commonly inform us beforehand of the uncertainty by that contrariety of events which we may learn from a diligent observation all effect follow not with like certainty from their suppose cause some events be find in all countries and all age to have be constantly conjoin together others be find to have be more variable and sometimes to disappoint our expectations so that in our reason concern matter of fact there be all imaginable degrees of assurance from the highest certainty to the lowest species of moral evidence a wise man therefore proportion his belief to the evidence in such conclusions as be found on an infallible experience he expect the event with the last degree of assurance and regard his past experience as a full proof of the future existence of that event in other case he proceed with more caution he weigh the opposite experiment he consider which side be support by the greater number of experiment to that side he incline with doubt and hesitation and when at last he fix his judgement the evidence exceed not what we properly call probability all probability then suppose an opposition of experiment and observations where the one side be find to overbalance the other and to produce a degree of evidence proportion to the superiority a hundred instance or experiment on one side and fifty on another afford a doubtful expectation of any event though a hundred uniform experiment with only one that be contradictory reasonably beget a pretty strong degree of assurance in all case we must balance the opposite experiment where they be opposite and deduct the smaller number from the greater in order to know the exact force of the superior evidence to apply these principles to a particular instance we may observe that there be no species of reason more common more useful and even necessary to human life than that which be derive from the testimony of men and the report of eyewitness and spectators this species of reason perhaps one may deny to be found on the relation of cause and effect shall not dispute about a word it will be sufficient to observe that our assurance in any argument of this kind be derive from no other principle than our observation of the veracity of human testimony and of the usual conformity of facts to the report of witness it be a general maxim that no object have any discoverable connexion together and that all the inferences which we can draw from one to another be found merely on our experience of their constant and regular conjunction it be evident that we ought not to make an exception to this maxim in favour of human testimony whose connexion with any event seem in itself as little necessary as any other be not the memory tenacious to a certain degree have not men commonly an inclination to truth and a principle of probity be they not sensible to shame when detect in a falsehood be not these say discover by experience to be qualities inherent in human nature we should never repose the least confidence in human testimony a man delirious or note for falsehood and villany have no manner of authority with us and as the evidence derive from witness and human testimony be found on past experience so it vary with the experience and be regard either as a proof or a probability accord as the conjunction between any particular kind of report and any kind of object have be find to be constant or variable there be a number of circumstances to be take into consideration in all judgements of this kind and the ultimate standard by which we determine all dispute that may arise concern them be always derive from experience and observation where this experience be not entirely uniform on any side it be attend with an unavoidable contrariety in our judgements and with the same opposition and mutual destruction of argument as in every other kind of evidence we frequently hesitate concern the report of others we balance the opposite circumstances which cause any doubt or uncertainty and when we discover a superiority on any side we incline to it but still with a diminution of assurance in proportion to the force of its antagonist this contrariety of evidence in the present case may be derive from several different cause from the opposition of contrary testimony from the character or number of the witness from the manner of their deliver their testimony or from the union of all these circumstances we entertain a suspicion concern any matter of fact when the witness contradict each other when they be but few or of a doubtful character when they have an interest in what they affirm when they deliver their testimony with hesitation or on the contrary with too violent asseverations there be many other particulars of the same kind which may diminish or destroy the force of any argument derive from human testimony suppose for instance that the fact which the testimony endeavour to establish partake of the extraordinary and the marvellous in that case the evidence result from the testimony admit of a diminution greater or less in proportion as the fact be more or less unusual the reason why we place any credit in witness and historians be not derive from any connexion which we perceive a priori between testimony and reality but because we be accustom to find a conformity between them but when the fact attest be such a one as have seldom fall under our observation here be a contest of two opposite experience of which the one destroy the other as far as its force go and the superior can only operate on the mind by the force which remain the very same principle of experience which give us a certain degree of assurance in the testimony of witness give us also in this case another degree of assurance against the fact which they endeavour to establish from which contradiction there necessarily arise a counterpoize and mutual destruction of belief and authority should not believe such a story be it tell me by cato be a proverbial say in rome even during the lifetime of that philosophical patriot the incredibility of a fact it be allow might invalidate so great an authority the indian prince who refuse to believe the first relations concern the effect of frost reason justly and it naturally require very strong testimony to engage his assent to facts that arise from a state of nature with which he be unacquainted and which bore so little analogy to those events of which he have have constant and uniform experience though they be not contrary to his experience they be not conformable to it but in order to encrease the probability against the testimony of witness let us suppose that the fact which they affirm instead of be only marvellous be really miraculous and suppose also that the testimony consider apart and in itself amount to an entire proof in that case there be proof against proof of which the strongest must prevail but still with a diminution of its force in proportion to that of its antagonist a miracle be a violation of the laws of nature and as a firm and unalterable experience have establish these laws the proof against a miracle from the very nature of the fact be as entire as any argument from experience can possibly be imagine why be it more than probable that all men must die that lead can not of itself remain suspend in the air that fire consume wood and be extinguish by water unless it be that these events be find agreeable to the laws of nature and there be require a violation of these laws or in other word a miracle to prevent them nothing be esteem a miracle if it ever happen in the common course of nature it be no miracle that a man seemingly in good health should die on a sudden because such a kind of death though more unusual than any other have yet be frequently observe to happen but it be a miracle that a dead man should come to life because that have never be observe in any age or country there must therefore be a uniform experience against every miraculous event otherwise the event would not merit that appellation and as a uniform experience amount to a proof there be here a direct and full proof from the nature of the fact against the existence of any miracle nor can such a proof be destroy or the miracle render credible but by an opposite proof which be superior the plain consequence be and it be a general maxim worthy of our attention that no testimony be sufficient to establish a miracle unless the testimony be of such a kind that its falsehood would be more miraculous than the fact which it endeavour to establish and even in that case there be a mutual destruction of arguments and the superior only give us an assurance suitable to that degree of force which remain after deduct the inferior when anyone tell me that he saw a dead man restore to life immediately consider with myself whether it be more probable that this person should either deceive or be deceive or that the fact which he relate should really have happen weigh the one miracle against the other and accord to the superiority which discover pronounce my decision and always reject the greater miracle if the falsehood of his testimony would be more miraculous than the event which he relate then and not till then can he pretend to command my belief or opinion part in the forego reason we have suppose that the testimony upon which a miracle be found may possibly amount to an entire proof and that the falsehood of that testimony would be a real prodigy but it be easy to shew that we have be a great deal too liberal in our concession and that there never be a miraculous event establish on so full an evidence for first there be not to be find in all history any miracle attest by a sufficient number of men of such unquestioned goodsense education and learn as to secure us against all delusion in themselves of such undoubted integrity as to place them beyond all suspicion of any design to deceive others of such credit and reputation in the eye of mankind as to have a great deal to lose in case of their be detect in any falsehood and at the same time attest facts perform in such a public manner and in so celebrate a part of the world as to render the detection unavoidable all which circumstances be requisite to give us a full assurance in the testimony of men secondly we may observe in human nature a principle which if strictly examine will be find to diminish extremely the assurance which we might from human testimony have in any kind of prodigy the maxim by which we commonly conduct ourselves in our reason be that the object of which we have no experience resemble those of which we have that what we have find to be most usual be always most probable and that where there be an opposition of arguments we ought to give the preference to such as be found on the greatest number of past observations but though in proceed by this rule we readily reject any fact which be unusual and incredible in an ordinary degree yet in advance farther the mind observe not always the same rule but when anything be affirm utterly absurd and miraculous it rather the more readily admit of such a fact upon account of that very circumstance which ought to destroy all its authority the passion of surprise and wonder arise from miracles be an agreeable emotion give a sensible tendency towards the belief of those events from which it be derive and this go so far that even those who can not enjoy this pleasure immediately nor can believe those miraculous events of which they be inform yet love to partake of the satisfaction at secondhand or by rebound and place a pride and delight in excite the admiration of others with what greediness be the miraculous account of travellers receive their descriptions of sea and land monsters their relations of wonderful adventure strange men and uncouth manners but if the spirit of religion join itself to the love of wonder there be an end of common sense and human testimony in these circumstances lose all pretensions to authority a religionist may be an enthusiast and imagine he see what have no reality he may know his narrative to be false and yet persevere in it with the best intentions in the world for the sake of promote so holy a cause or even where this delusion have not place vanity excite by so strong a temptation operate on him more powerfully than on the rest of mankind in any other circumstances and selfinterest with equal force his auditors may not have and commonly have not sufficient judgement to canvas his evidence what judgement they have they renounce by principle in these sublime and mysterious subject or if they be ever so will to employ it passion and a heat imagination disturb the regularity of its operations their credulity increase his impudence and his impudence overpower their credulity eloquence when at its highest pitch leave little room for reason or reflection but address itself entirely to the fancy or the affections captivate the will hearers and subdue their understand happily this pitch it seldom attain but what a tully or a demosthenes could scarcely effect over a roman or athenian audience every capuchin every itinerant or stationary teacher can perform over the generality of mankind and in a higher degree by touch such gross and vulgar passions the many instance of forge miracles and prophecies and supernatural events which in all age have either be detect by contrary evidence or which detect themselves by their absurdity prove sufficiently the strong propensity of mankind to the extraordinary and the marvellous and ought reasonably to beget a suspicion against all relations of this kind this be our natural way of think even with regard to the most common and most credible events for instance there be no kind of report which rise so easily and spread so quickly especially in country place and provincial towns as those concern marriages insomuch that two young persons of equal condition never see each other twice but the whole neighbourhood immediately join them together the pleasure of tell a piece of news so interest of propagate it and of be the first reporters of it spread the intelligence and this be so well know that no man of sense give attention to these report till he find them confirm by some greater evidence do not the same passions and others still stronger incline the generality of mankind to believe and report with the greatest vehemence and assurance all religious miracles thirdly it form a strong presumption against all supernatural and miraculous relations that they be observe chiefly to abound among ignorant and barbarous nations or if a civilize people have ever give admission to any of them that people will be find to have receive them from ignorant and barbarous ancestors who transmit them with that inviolable sanction and authority which always attend receive opinions when we peruse the first histories of all nations we be apt to imagine ourselves transport into some new world where the whole frame of nature be disjoint and every element perform its operations in a different manner from what it do at present battle revolutions pestilence famine and death be never the effect of those natural cause which we experience prodigies omen oracles judgements quite obscure the few natural events that be intermingle with them but as the former grow thinner every page in proportion as we advance nearer the enlighten age we soon learn that there be nothing mysterious or su pernatural in the case but that all proceed from the usual propensity of mankind towards the marvellous and that though this inclination may at intervals receive a check from sense and learn it can never be thoroughly extirpate from human nature it be strange a judicious reader be apt to say upon the perusal of these wonderful historians that such prodigious events never happen in our days but it be nothing strange hope that men should lie in all age you must surely have see instance enough of that frailty you have yourself hear many such marvellous relations start which be treat with scorn by all the wise and judicious have at last be abandon even by the vulgar be assure that those renowned lie which have spread and flourish to such a monstrous height arise from like beginnings but be sow in a more proper soil shoot up at last into prodigies almost equal to those which they relate it be a wise policy in that false prophet alexander who though now forget be once so famous to lay the first scene of his impostures in paphlagonia where as lucian tell us the people be extremely ignorant and stupid and ready to swallow even the grossest delusion people at a distance who be weak enough to think the matter at all worth enquiry have no opportunity of receive better information the stories come magnify to them by a hundred circumstances fool be industrious in propagate the imposture while the wise and learn be content in general to deride its absurdity without inform themselves of the particular facts by which it may be distinctly refute and thus the impostor above mention be enable to proceed from his ignorant paphlagonians to the enlist of votaries even among the grecian philosophers and men of the most eminent rank and distinction in rome nay could engage the attention of that sage emperor marcus aurelius so far as to make him trust the success of a military expedition to his delusive prophecies the advantage be so great of start an imposture among an ignorant people that even though the delusion should be too gross to impose on the generality of them which though seldom be sometimes the case it have a much better chance for succeed in remote countries than if the first scene have be lay in a city renowned for arts and knowledge the most ignorant and barbarous of these barbarians carry the report abroad none of their countrymen have a large correspondence or sufficient credit and authority to contradict and beat down the delusion mens inclination to the marvellous have full opportunity to display itself and thus a story which be universally explode in the place where it be first start shall pass for certain at a thousand miles distance but have alexander fix his residence at athens the philosophers of that renowned mart of learn have immediately spread throughout the whole roman empire their sense of the matter which be support by so great authority and display by all the force of reason and eloquence have entirely open the eye of mankind it be true lucian pass by chance through paphlagonia have an opportunity of perform this good office but though much to be wish it do not always happen that every alexander meet with a lucian ready to expose and detect his impostures may add as a fourth reason which diminish the authority of prodigies that there be no testimony for any even those which have not be expressly detect that be not oppose by an infinite number of witness so that not only the miracle destroy the credit of testimony but the testimony destroy itself to make this the better understand let us consider that in matter of religion whatever be different be contrary and that it be impossible the religions of ancient rome of turkey of siam and of china should all of them be establish on any solid foundation every miracle therefore pretend to have be work in any of these religions and all of them abound in miracles as its direct scope be to establish the particular system to which it be attribute so have it the same force though more indirectly to overthrow every other system in destroy a rival system it likewise destroy the credit of those miracles on which that system be establish so that all the prodigies of different religions be to be regard as contrary facts and the evidence of these prodigies whether weak or strong as opposite to each other accord to this method of reason when we believe any miracle of mahomet or his successors we have for our warrant the testimony of a few barbarous arabians and on the other hand we be to regard the authority of titus livius plutarch tacitus and in short of all the author and witness grecian chinese and roman catholic who have relate any miracle in their particular religion say we be to regard their testimony in the same light as if they have mention that mahometan miracle and have in express term contradict it with the same certainty as they have for the miracle they relate this argument may appear over subtile and refine but be not in reality different from the reason of a judge who suppose that the credit of two witness maintain a crime against any one be destroy by the testi mony of two others who affirm him to have be two hundred league distant at the same instant when the crime be say to have be commit one of the best attest miracles in all profane history be that which tacitus report of vespasian who cure a blind man in alexandria by mean of his spittle and a lame man by the mere touch of his foot in obedience to a vision of the god serapis who have enjoin them to have recourse to the emperor for these miraculous cure the story may be see in that fine historian where every circumstance seem to add weight to the testimony and might be display at large with all the force of argument and eloquence if any one be now concern to enforce the evidence of that explode and idolatrous superstition the gravity solidity age and probity of so great an emperor who through the whole course of his life converse in a familiar manner with his friends and courtiers and never affect those extraordinary air of divinity assume by alexander and demetrius the historian a contemporary writer note for candour and veracity and withal the greatest and most penetrate genius perhaps of all antiquity and so free from any tendency to credulity that he even lie under the contrary imputation of atheism and profaneness the persons from whose authority he relate the miracle of establish character for judgement and veracity as we may well presume eyewitness of the fact and confirm their testimony after the flavian family be despoil of the empire and could no longer give any reward as the price of a lie utrumque qui interfuere nunc quoque memorant postquam nullum mendacio pretium to which if we add the public nature of the facts as relate it will appear that no evidence can well be suppose stronger for so gross and so palpable a falsehood there be also a memorable story relate by cardinal de retz which may well deserve our consideration when that intrigue politician flee into spain to avoid the persecution of his enemies he pass through saragossa the capital of aragon where he be shew in the cathedral a man who have serve seven years as a doorkeeper and be well know to every body in town that have ever pay his devotions at that church he have be see for so long a time want a leg but recover that limb by the rub of holy oil upon the stump and the cardinal assure us that he saw him with two legs this miracle be vouch by all the canons of the church and the whole company in town be appeal to for a confirmation of the fact whom the cardinal find by their zealous devotion to be thorough believers of the miracle here the relater be also contemporary to the suppose prodigy of an incredulous and libertine character as well as of great genius the miracle of so singular a nature as could scarcely admit of a counterfeit and the witness very numerous and all of them in a manner spectators of the fact to which they give their testimony and what add mightily to the force of the evidence and may double our surprise on this occasion be that the cardinal himself who relate the story seem not to give any credit to it and consequently can not be suspect of any concurrence in the holy fraud he consider justly that it be not requisite in order to reject a fact of this nature to be able accurately to disprove the testimony and to trace its falsehood through all the circumstances of knavery and credulity which produce it he know that as this be commonly altogether impossible at any small distance of time and place so be it extremely difficult even where one be immediately present by reason of the bigotry ignorance cunning and roguery of a great part of mankind he therefore conclude like a just reasoner that such an evidence carry falsehood upon the very face of it and that a miracle support by any human testimony be more properly a subject of derision than of argument there surely never be a greater number of miracles ascribe to one person than those which be lately say to have be work in france upon the tomb of abbe paris the famous jansenist with whose sanctity the people be so long delude the cure of the sick give hear to the deaf and sight to the blind be every where talk of as the usual effect of that holy sepulchre but what be more extraordinary many of the miracles be immediately prove upon the spot before judge of unquestioned integrity attest by witness of credit and distinction in a learn age and on the most eminent theatre that be now in the world nor be this all a relation of them be publish and disperse every where nor be the jesuits though a learn body support by the civil magistrate and determine enemies to those opinions in whose favour the miracles be say to have be work ever able distinctly to refute or detect them where shall we find such a number of circumstances agree to the corroboration of one fact and what have we to oppose to such a cloud of witness but the absolute impossibility or miraculous nature of the events which they relate and this surely in the eye of all reasonable people will alone be regard as a sufficient refutation be the consequence just because some human testimony have the utmost force and authority in some case when it relate the battle of philippi or pharsalia for instance that therefore all kinds of testimony must in all case have equal force and authority suppose that the caesarean and pompeian factions have each of them claim the victory in these battle and that the historians of each party have uniformly ascribe the advantage to their own side how could mankind at this distance have be able to determine between them the contrariety be equally strong between the miracles relate by herodotus or plutarch and those deliver by mariana bede or any monkish historian the wise lend a very academic faith to every report which favour the passion of the reporter whether it magnify his country his family or himself or in any other way strike in with his natural inclinations and propensities but what greater temptation than to appear a missionary a prophet an ambassador from heaven who would not encounter many dangers and difficulties in order to attain so sublime a character or if by the help of vanity and a heat imagination a man have first make a convert of himself and enter seriously into the delusion who ever scruple to make use of pious frauds in support of so holy and meritorious a cause the smallest spark may here kindle into the greatest flame because the materials be always prepare for it the avidum genus auricularum the gaze populace receive greedily without examination whatever sooths superstition and promote wonder how many stories of this nature have in all age be detect and explode in their infancy how many more have be celebrate for a time and have afterwards sink into neglect and oblivion where such report therefore fly about the solution of the phenomenon be obvious and we in conformity to regular experience and observation when we account for it by the know and natural principles of credulity and delusion and shall we rather than have a recourse to so natural a solution allow of a miraculous violation of the most establish laws of nature need not mention the difficulty of detect a falsehood in any private or even public history at the place where it be say to happen much more when the scene be remove to ever so small a distance even a court of judicature with all the authority accuracy and judgement which they can employ find themselves often at a loss to distinguish between truth and falsehood in the most recent action but the matter never come to any issue if trust to the common method of alterca tions and debate and fly rumour especially when mens passions have take part on either side in the infancy of new religions the wise and learn commonly esteem the matter too inconsiderable to deserve their attention or regard and when afterwards they would willingly detect the cheat in order to undeceive the delude multitude the season be now past and the record and witness which might clear up the matter have perish beyond recovery no mean of detection remain but those which must be draw from the very testimony itself of the reporters and these though always sufficient with the judicious and know be commonly too fine to fall under the comprehension of the vulgar upon the whole then it appear that no testimony for any kind of miracle have ever amount to a probability much less to a proof and that even suppose it amount to a proof it would be oppose by another proof derive from the very nature of the fact which it would endeavour to establish it be experience only which give authority to human testimony and it be the same experience which assure us of the laws of nature when therefore these two kinds of experience be contrary we have nothing to do but substract the one from the other and embrace an opinion either on one side or the other with that assurance which arise from the remainder but accord to the principle here explain this substraction with regard to all popular religions amount to an entire annihilation and therefore we may establish it as a maxim that no human testimony can have such force as to prove a miracle and make it a just foundation for any such system of religion beg the limitations here make may be remark when say that a miracle can never be prove so as to be the foundation of a system of religion for own that otherwise there may possibly be miracles or violations of the usual course of nature of such a kind as to admit of proof from human testimony though perhaps it will be impossible to find any such in all the record of history thus suppose all author in all languages agree that from the first of january there be a total darkness over the whole earth for eight days suppose that the tradition of this extraordinary event be still strong and lively among the people that all travellers who return from foreign countries bring us account of the same tradition without the least variation or contradiction it be evident that our present philosophers instead of doubt the fact ought to receive it as certain and ought to search for the cause whence it might be derive the decay corruption and dissolution of nature be an event render probable by so many analogies that any phenomenon which seem to have a tendency towards that catastrophe come within the reach of human testimony if that testimony be very extensive and uniform but suppose that all the historians who treat of england should agree that on the first of january queen elizabeth die that both before and after her death she be see by her physicians and the whole court as be usual with persons of her rank that her successor be acknowledge and proclaim by the parliament and that after be inter a month she again appear resume the throne and govern england for three years must confess that should be surprise at the concurrence of so many odd circumstances but should not have the least inclination to believe so miraculous an event should not doubt of her pretend death and of those other public circumstances that follow it should only assert it to have be pretend and that it neither be nor possibly could be real you would in vain object to me the difficulty and almost impossibility of deceive the world in an affair of such consequence the wisdom and solid judgement of that renowned queen with the little or no advantage which she could reap from so poor an artifice all this might astonish me but would still reply that the knavery and folly of men be such common phenomena that should rather believe the most extraordinary events to arise from their concurrence than admit of so signal a violation of the laws of nature but should this miracle be ascribe to any new system of religion men in all age have be so much impose on by ridiculous stories of that kind that this very circumstance would be a full proof of a cheat and sufficient with all men of sense not only to make them reject the fact but even reject it without farther examination though the be to whom the miracle be ascribe be in this case almighty it do not upon that account become a whit more probable since it be impossible for us to know the attribute or action of such a be otherwise than from the experience which we have of his productions in the usual course of nature this still reduce us to past observation and oblige us to compare the instance of the violation of truth in the testimony of men with those of the violation of the laws of nature by miracles in order to judge which of them be most likely and probable as the violations of truth be more common in the testimony concern religious miracles than in that concern any other matter of fact this must diminish very much the authority of the former testimony and make us form a general resolution never to lend any attention to it with whatever specious pretence it may be cover lord bacon seem to have embrace the same principles of reason we ought say he to make a collection or particular history of all monsters and prodigious birth or productions and in a word of everything new rare and extraordinary in nature but this must be do with the most severe scrutiny lest we depart from truth above all every relation must be consider as suspicious which depend in any degree upon religion as the prodigies of livy and no less so everything that be to be find in the writers of natural magic or alchemy or such author who seem all of them to have an unconquerable appetite for falsehood and fable be the better please with the method of reason here deliver as think it may serve to confound those dangerous friends or disguise enemies to the christian religion who have undertake to defend it by the principles of human reason our most holy religion be found on faith not on reason and it be a sure method of expose it to put it to such a trial as it be by no mean fit to endure to make this more evident let us examine those miracles relate in scripture and not to lose ourselves in too wide a field let us confine ourselves to such as we find in the pentateuch which we shall examine accord to the principles of these pretend christians not as the word or testimony of god himself but as the production of a mere human writer and historian here then we be first to consider a book present to us by a barbarous and ignorant people write in an age when they be still more barbarous and in all probability long after the facts which it relate corroborate by no concur testimony and resemble those fabulous account which every nation give of its origin upon read this book we find it full of prodigies and miracles it give an account of a state of the world and of human nature entirely different from the present of our fall from that state of the age of man extend to near a thousand years of the destruction of the world by a deluge of the arbitrary choice of one people as the favourites of heaven and that people the countrymen of the author of their deliverance from bondage by prodigies the most astonish imaginable desire anyone to lay his hand upon his heart and after a serious consideration declare whether he think that the falsehood of such a book support by such a testimony would be more extraordinary and miraculous than all the miracles it relate which be however necessary to make it be receive accord to the measure of probability above establish what we have say of miracles may be apply without any variation to prophecies and indeed all prophecies be real miracles and as such only can be admit as proof of any revelation if it do not exceed the capacity of human nature to foretell future events it would be absurd to employ any prophecy as an argument for a divine mission or authority from heaven so that upon the whole we may conclude that the christian religion not only be at first attend with miracles but even at this day can not be believe by any reasonable person without one mere reason be insufficient to convince us of its veracity and whoever be move by faith to assent to it be conscious of a continue miracle in his own person which subvert all the principles of his understand and give him a determination to believe what be most contrary to custom and experience sect of a particular providence and of a future state be lately engage in conversation with a friend who love sceptical paradoxes where though he advance many principles of which can by no mean approve yet as they seem to be curious and to bear some relation to the chain of reason carry on throughout this enquiry shall here copy them from my memory as accurately as can in order to submit them to the judgement of the reader our conversation begin with my admire the singular good fortune of philosophy which as it require entire liberty above all other privilege and chiefly flourish from the free opposition of sentiments and argumentation receive its first birth in an age and country of freedom and toleration and be never cramp even in its most extravagant principles by any creeds concessions or penal statutes for except the banishment of protagoras and the death of socrates which last event proceed partly from other motives there be scarcely any instance to be meet with in ancient history of this bigotted jealousy with which the present age be so much infest epicurus live at athens to an advance age in peace and tranquillity epicureans be even admit to receive the sacerdotal character and to officiate at the altar in the most sacred rites of the establish religion and the public encouragement of pension and salaries be afford equally by the wisest of all the roman emperors to the professors of every sect of philoso phy how requisite such kind of treatment be to philosophy in her early youth will easily be conceive if we reflect that even at present when she may be suppose more hardy and robust she bear with much difficulty the inclemency of the season and those harsh wind of calumny and persecution which blow upon her you admire say my friend as the singular good fortune of philosophy what seem to result from the natural course of things and to be unavoidable in every age and nation this pertinacious bigotry of which you complain as so fatal to philosophy be really her offspring who after ally with superstition separate himself entirely from the interest of his parent and become her most inveterate enemy and persecutor speculative dogmas of religion the present occasion of such furious dispute could not possibly be conceive or admit in the early age of the world when mankind be wholly illiterate form an idea of religion more suitable to their weak apprehension and compose their sacred tenets of such tales chiefly as be the object of traditional belief more than of argument or disputation after the first alarm therefore be over which arise from the new paradoxes and principles of the philosophers these teachers seem ever after during the age of antiquity to have live in great harmony with the establish superstition and to have make a fair partition of mankind between them the former claim all the learn and wise the latter possess all the vulgar and illiterate it seem then say that you leave politics entirely out of the question and never suppose that a wise magistrate can justly be jealous of certain tenets of philosophy such as those of epicurus which deny a divine existence and consequently a providence and a future state seem to loosen in a great measure the tie of morality and may be suppose for that reason pernicious to the peace of civil society know reply he that in fact these persecutions never in any age proceed from calm reason or from experience of the pernicious consequences of philosophy but arise entirely from passion and prejudice but what if should advance farther and assert that if epicurus have be accuse before the people by any of the sycophants or informers of those days he could easily have defend his cause and prove his principles of philosophy to be as salutary as those of his adversaries who endeavour with such zeal to expose him to the public hatred and jealousy wish say you would try your eloquence upon so extraordinary a topic and make a speech for epicurus which might satisfy not the mob of athens if you will allow that ancient and polite city to have contain any mob but the more philosophical part of his audience such as might be suppose capable of comprehend his arguments the matter would not be difficult upon such condition reply he and if you please shall suppose myself epicurus for a moment and make you stand for the athenian people and shall deliver you such an harangue as will fill all the urn with white bean and leave not a black one to gratify the malice of my adversaries very well pray proceed upon these suppositions come hither o ye athenians to justify in your assembly what maintain in my school and find myself impeach by furious antagonists instead of reason with calm and dispassionate enquirers your deliberations which of right should be direct to question of public good and the interest of the commonwealth be divert to the disquisitions of speculative philosophy and these magnificent but perhaps fruitless enquiries take place of your more familiar but more useful occupations but so far as in me lie will prevent this abuse we shall not here dispute concern the origin and government of worlds we shall only enquire how far such question concern the public interest and if can persuade you that they be entirely indifferent to the peace of society and security of government hope that you will presently send us back to our school there to examine at leisure the question the most sublime but at the same time the most speculative of all philosophy the religious philosophers not satisfy with the tradition of your forefathers and doctrine of your priests in which willingly acquiesce indulge a rash curiosity in try how far they can establish religion upon the principles of reason and they thereby excite instead of satisfy the doubt which naturally arise from a diligent and scrutinous enquiry they paint in the most magnificent colour the order beauty and wise arrangement of the universe and then ask if such a glorious display of intelligence could proceed from the fortuitous concourse of atoms or if chance could produce what the greatest genius can never sufficiently admire shall not examine the justness of this argument shall allow it to be as solid as my antagonists and accusers can desire it be sufficient if can prove from this very reason that the question be entirely speculative and that when in my philosophical disquisitions deny a providence and a future state undermine not the foundations of society but advance principles which they themselves upon their own topics if they argue consistently must allow to be solid and satisfactory you then who be my accusers have acknowledge that the chief or sole argument for a divine existence which never question be derive from the order of nature where there appear such mark of intelligence and design that you think it extravagant to assign for its cause either chance or the blind and unguided force of matter you allow that this be an argument draw from effect to cause from the order of the work you infer that there must have be project and forethought in the workman if you can not make out this point you allow that your conclusion fail and you pretend not to establish the conclusion in a greater latitude than the phenomena of nature will justify these be your concessions desire you to mark the consequences when we infer any particular cause from an effect we must proportion the one to the other and can never be allow to ascribe to the cause any qualities but what be exactly sufficient to produce the effect a body of ten ounces raise in any scale may serve as a proof that the counterbalance weight exceed ten ounces but can never afford a reason that it exceed a hundred if the cause assign for any effect be not sufficient to produce it we must either reject that cause or add to it such qualities as will give it a just proportion to the effect but if we ascribe to it farther qualities or affirm it capable of produce other effect we can only indulge the licence of conjecture and arbitrarily suppose the existence of qualities and energies without reason or authority the same rule hold whether the cause assign be brute unconscious matter or a rational intelligent be if the cause be know only by the effect we never ought to ascribe to it any qualities beyond what be precisely requisite to produce the effect nor can we by any rule of just reason return back from the cause and infer other effect from it beyond those by which alone it be know to us no one merely from the sight of one of zeuxiss picture could know that he be also a statuary or architect and be an artist no less skilful in stone and marble than in colour the talents and taste display in the particular work before us these we may safely conclude the workman to be possess of the cause must be proportion to the effect and if we exactly and precisely proportion it we shall never find in it any qualities that point farther or afford an inference concern any other design or perfor mance such qualities must be somewhat beyond what be merely requisite for produce the effect which we examine allow therefore the gods to be the author of the existence or order of the universe it follow that they possess that precise degree of power intelligence and benevolence which appear in their workmanship but nothing farther can ever be prove except we call in the assistance of exaggeration and flattery to supply the defect of argument and reason so far as the trace of any attribute at present appear so far may we conclude these attribute to exist the supposition of farther attribute be mere hypothesis much more the supposition that in distant regions of space or periods of time there have be or will be a more magnificent display of these attribute and a scheme of administration more suitable to such imaginary virtues we can never be allow to mount up from the universe the effect to jupiter the cause and then descend downwards to infer any new effect from that cause as if the present effect alone be not entirely worthy of the glorious attribute which we ascribe to that deity the knowledge of the cause be derive solely from the effect they must be exactly adjust to each other and the one can never refer to anything further or be the foundation of any new inference and conclusion you find certain phenomena in nature you seek a cause or author you imagine that you have find him you afterwards become so enamour of this offspring of your brain that you imagine it impossible but he must produce something greater and more perfect than the present scene of things which be so full of ill and disorder you forget that this superlative intelligence and benevolence be entirely imaginary or at least without any foundation in reason and that you have no grind to ascribe to him any qualities but what you see he have actually exert and display in his productions let your gods therefore o philosophers be suit to the present appearances of nature and presume not to alter these appearances by arbitrary suppositions in order to suit them to the attribute which you so fondly ascribe to your deities when priests and poets support by your authority o athenians talk of a golden or silver age which precede the present state of vice and miscry hear them with attention and with reverence but when philosophers who pretend to neglect authority and to cultivate reason hold the same discourse pay them not own the same obsequious submission and pious deference ask who carry them into the celestial regions who admit them into the councils of the gods who open to them the book of fate that they thus rashly affirm that their deities have execute or will execute any purpose beyond what have actually appear if they tell me that they have mount on the step or by the gradual ascent of reason and by draw inferences from effect to cause still insist that they have aid the ascent of reason by the wing of imagination otherwise they could not thus change their manner of inference and argue from cause to effect presume that a more perfect production than the present world would be more suitable to such perfect be as the gods and forget that they have no reason to ascribe to these celestial be any perfection or any attribute but what can be find in the present world hence all the fruitless industry to account for the ill appearances of nature and save the honour of the gods while we must acknowledge the reality of that evil and disorder with which the world so much abound the obstinate and intractable qualities of matter we be tell or the observance of general laws or some such reason be the sole cause which control the power and benevolence of jupiter and oblige him to create mankind and every sensible creature so imperfect and so unhappy these attribute then be it seem beforehand take for grant in their greatest latitude and upon that supposition own that such conjecture may perhaps be admit as plausible solutions of the ill phenomena but still ask why take these attribute for grant or why ascribe to the cause any qualities but what actually appear in the effect why torture your brain to justify the course of nature upon suppositions which for aught you know may be entirely imaginary and of which there be to be find no trace in the course of nature the religious hypothesis therefore must be consider only as a particular method of account for the visible phenomena of the universe but no just reasoner will ever presume to infer from it any single fact and alter or add to the phenomena in any single particular if you think that the appearances of things prove such cause it be allowable for you to draw an inference concern the existence of these cause in such complicate and sublime subject every one should be indulge in the liberty of conjecture and argument but here you ought to rest if you come backward and argue from your infer cause conclude that any other fact have exist or will exist in the course of nature which may serve as a fuller display of particular attribute must admonish you that you have depart from the method of reason at tached to the present subject and have certainly add something to the attribute of the cause beyond what appear in the effect otherwise you could never with tolerable sense or propriety add anything to the effect in order to render it more worthy of the cause where then be the odiousness of that doctrine which teach in my school or rather which examine in my garden or what do you find in this whole question wherein the security of good morals or the peace and order of society be in the least concern deny a providence you say and supreme governor of the world who guide the course of events and punish the vicious with infamy and disappointment and reward the virtuous with honour and success in all their undertake but surely deny not the course itself of events which lie open to every ones inquiry and examination acknowledge that in the present order of things virtue be attend with more peace of mind than vice and meet with a more favourable reception from the world be sensible that accord to the past experience of mankind friendship be the chief joy of human life and moderation the only source of tranquillity and happiness never balance between the virtuous and the vicious course of life but be sensible that to a welldisposed mind every advantage be on the side of the former and what can you say more allow all your suppositions and reason you tell me indeed that this disposition of things proceed from intelligence and design but whatever it proceed from the disposition itself on which depend our happiness or misery and consequently our conduct and deportment in life be still the same it be still open for me as well as you to regulate my behaviour by my experience of past events and if you affirm that while a divine providence be allow and a supreme distributive justice in the universe ought to expect some more particular reward of the good and punishment of the bad beyond the ordinary course of events here find the same fallacy which have before endeavour to detect you persist in imagine that if we grant that divine existence for which you so earnestly contend you may safely infer consequences from it and add something to the experience order of nature by argue from the attribute which you ascribe to your gods you seem not to remember that all your reason on this subject can only be draw from effect to cause and that every argument deduct from cause to effect must of necessity be a gross sophism since it be impossible for you to know anything of the cause but what you have antecedently not infer but discover to the full in the effect but what must a philosopher think of those vain reasoners who instead of regard the present scene of things as the sole object of their contemplation so far reverse the whole course of nature as to render this life merely a passage to something farther a porch which lead to a greater and vastly different build a prologue which serve only to introduce the piece and give it more grace and propriety whence do you think can such philosophers derive their idea of the gods from their own conceit and imagination surely for if they derive it from the present phenomena it would never point to anything farther but must be exactly adjust to them that the divinity may possibly be endow with attribute which we have never see exert may be govern by principles of action which we can not discover to be satisfy all this will freely be allow but still this be mere possibility and hypothesis we never can have reason to in infer any attribute or any principles of action in him but so far as we know them to have be exert and satisfy be there any mark of a distributive justice in the world if you answer in the affirmative conclude that since justice here exert itself it be satisfy if you reply in the negative conclude that you have then no reason to ascribe justice in our sense of it to the gods if you hold a medium between affirmation and negation by say that the justice of the gods at present exert itself in part but not in its full extent answer that you have no reason to give it any particular extent but only so far as you see it at present exert itself thus bring the dispute o athenians to a short issue with my antagonists the course of nature lie open to my contemplation as well as to theirs the experience train of events be the great standard by which we all regulate our conduct nothing else can be appeal to in the field or in the senate nothing else ought ever to be hear of in the school or in the closet in vain would our limit understand break through those boundaries which be too narrow for our fond imagination while we argue from the course of nature and infer a particular intelligent cause which first bestow and still preserve order in the universe we embrace a principle which be both uncertain and useless it be uncertain because the subject lie entirely beyond the reach of human experience it be useless because our knowledge of this cause be derive entirely from the course of nature we can never accord to the rule of just reason return back from the cause with any new inference or make additions to the common and experience course of nature establish any new principles of conduct and behaviour observe say find he have finish his harangue that you neglect not the artifice of the demagogues of old and as you be please to make me stand for the people you insinuate yourself into my favour by embrace those principles to which you know have always express a particular attachment but allow you to make experience as indeed think you ought the only standard of our judgement concern this and all other question of fact doubt not but from the very same experience to which you appeal it may be possible to refute this reason which you have put into the mouth of epicurus if you saw for instance a halffinished build surround with heap of brick and stone and mortar and all the instrument of masonry could you not infer from the effect that it be a work of design and contrivance and could you not return again from this infer cause to infer new additions to the effect and conclude that the build would soon be finish and receive all the further improvements which art could bestow upon it if you saw upon the seashore the print of one human foot you would conclude that a man have pass that way and that he have also leave the trace of the other foot though efface by the roll of the sand or inundation of the water why then do you refuse to admit the same method of reason with regard to the order of nature consider the world and the present life only as an imperfect build from which you can infer a superior intelligence and argue from that superior intelligence which can leave nothing imperfect why may you not infer a more finish scheme or plan which will receive its completion in some distant point of space or time be not these methods of reason exactly similar and under what pretence can you embrace the one while you reject the other the infinite difference of the subject reply he be a sufficient foundation for this difference in my conclusions in work of human art and contrivance it be allowable to advance from the effect to the cause and return back from the cause to form new inferences concern the effect and examine the alterations which it have probably undergo or may still undergo but what be the foundation of this method of reason plainly this that man be a be whom we know by experience whose motives and design we be acquaint with and whose project and inclinations have a certain connexion and coherence accord to the laws which nature have establish for the government of such a creature when therefore we find that any work have proceed from the skill and industry of man as we be otherwise acquaint with the nature of the animal we can draw a hundred inferences concern what may be expect from him and these inferences will all be found in experience and observation but do we know man only from the single work or production which we examine it be impossible for us to argue in this manner because our knowledge of all the qualities which we ascribe to him be in that case derive from the production it be impossible they could point to anything farther or be the foundation of any new inference the print of a foot in the sand can only prove when consider alone that there be some figure adapt to it by which it be produce but the print of a human foot prove likewise from our other experience that there be probably another foot which also leave its impression though efface by time or other accidents here we mount from the effect to the cause and descend again from the cause infer alterations in the effect but this be not a continuation of the same simple chain of reason we comprehend in this case a hundred other experience and observations concern the usual figure and members of that species of animal without which this method of argument must be consider as fallacious and sophistical the case be not the same with our reason from the work of nature the deity be know to us only by his productions and be a single be in the universe not comprehend under any species or genus from whose experience attribute or qualities we can by analogy infer any attribute or quality in him as the universe shew wisdom and goodness we infer wisdom and goodness as it shew a particular degree of these perfections we infer a particular degree of them precisely adapt to the effect which we examine but farther attribute or farther degrees of the same attribute we can never be authorise to infer or suppose by any rule of just reason now without some such licence of supposition it be impossible for us to argue from the cause or infer any alteration in the effect beyond what have immediately fall under our observation greater good produce by this be must still prove a greater degree of goodness a more impartial distribution of reward and punishments must proceed from a greater regard to justice and equity every suppose addition to the work of nature make an addition to the attribute of the author of nature and consequently be entirely unsupported by any reason or argument can never be admit but as mere conjecture and hypothesis the great source of our mistake in this subject and of the unbounded licence of conjecture which we indulge be that we tacitly consider ourselves as in the place of the supreme be and conclude that he will on every occasion observe the same conduct which we ourselves in his situation would have embrace as reasonable and eligible but besides that the ordinary course of nature may convince us that almost everything be regulate by principles and maxims very different from ours besides this say it must evidently appear contrary to all rule of analogy to reason from the intentions and project of men to those of a be so different and so much superior in human nature there be a certain experience coherence of design and inclinations so that when from any fact we have discover one intention of any man it may often be reasonable from experience to infer another and draw a long chain of conclusions concern his past or future conduct but this method of reason can never have place with regard to a be so remote and incomprehensible who bear much less analogy to any other be in the universe than the sun to a waxen taper and who discover himself only by some faint trace or outline beyond which we have no authority to ascribe to him any attribute or perfection what we imagine to be a superior perfection may really be a defect or be it ever so much a perfection the ascribe of it to the supreme be where it appear not to have be really exert to the full in his work savour more of flattery and panegyric than of just reason and sound philosophy all the philosophy therefore in the world and all the religion which be nothing but a species of philosophy will never be able to carry us beyond the usual course of experience or give us measure of conduct and behaviour different from those which be furnish by reflections on common life no new fact can ever be infer from the religious hypothesis no event foresee or foretell no reward or punishment expect or dread beyond what be already know by practice and observation so that my apology for epicurus will still appear solid and satisfactory nor have the political interest of society any connexion with the philosophical dispute concern metaphysics and religion there be still one circumstance reply which you seem to have overlook though should allow your premise must deny your conclusion you conclude that religious doctrines and reason can have no influence on life because they ought to have no influence never consider that men reason not in the same manner you do but draw many consequences from the belief of a divine existence and suppose that the deity will inflict punishments on vice and bestow reward on virtue beyond what appear in the ordinary course of nature whether this reason of theirs be just or not be no matter its influence on their life and conduct must still be the same and those who attempt to disabuse them of such prejudice may for aught know be good reasoners but can not allow them to be good citizens and politicians since they free men from one restraint upon their passions and make the infringement of the laws of society in one respect more easy and secure after all may perhaps agree to your general conclusion in favour of liberty though upon different premise from those on which you endeavour to find it think that the state ought to tolerate every principle of philosophy nor be there an instance that any government have suffer in its political interest by such indulgence there be no enthusiasm among philosophers their doctrines be not very allure to the people and no restraint can be put upon their reason but what must be of dangerous consequence to the sciences and even to the state by pave the way for persecution and oppression in point where the generality of mankind be more deeply interest and concern but there occur to me continue with regard to your main topic a difficulty which shall just propose to you without insist on it lest it lead into reason of too nice and delicate a nature in a word much doubt whether it be possible for a cause to be know only by its effect as you have all along suppose or to be of so singular and particular a nature as to have no parallel and no similarity with any other cause or object that have ever fall under our observation it be only when two species of object be find to be constantly conjoin that we can infer the one from the other and be an effect present which be entirely singular and could not be comprehend under any know species do not see that we could form any conjecture or inference at all concern its cause if experience and observation and analogy be indeed the only guide which we can reasonably follow in inferences of this nature both the effect and cause must bear a similarity and resemblance to other effect and cause which we know and which we have find in many instance to be conjoin with each other leave it to your own reflection to pursue the consequences of this principle shall just observe that as the antagonists of epicurus always suppose the universe an effect quite singular and unparalleled to be the proof of a deity a cause no less singular and unparalleled your reason upon that supposition seem at least to merit our attention there be own some difficulty how we can ever return from the cause to the effect and reason from our ideas of the former infer any alteration on the latter or any addition to it sect of the academical or sceptical philosophy part there be not a greater number of philosophical reason display upon any subject than those which prove the existence of a deity and refute the fallacies of atheists and yet the most religious philosophers still dispute whether any man can be so blind as to be a speculative atheist how shall we reconcile these contradictions the knightserrant who wander about to clear the world of dragons and giants never entertain the least doubt with regard to the existence of these monsters the sceptic be another enemy of religion who naturally provoke the indignation of all divine and graver philosophers though it be certain that no man ever meet with any such absurd creature or converse with a man who have no opinion or principle concern any subject either of action or speculation this beget a very natural question what be mean by a sceptic and how far it be possible to push these philosophical principles of doubt and uncertainty there be a species of scepticism antecedent to all study and philosophy which be much inculcate by des cart and others as a sovereign preservative against error and precipitate judgement it recommend an universal doubt not only of all our former opinions and principles but also of our very faculties of whose veracity say they we must assure ourselves by a chain of reason deduce from some original principle which can not possibly be fallacious or deceitful but neither be there any such original principle which have a prerogative above others that be selfevident and convince or if there be could we advance a step beyond it but by the use of those very faculties of which we be suppose to be already diffident the cartesian doubt therefore be it ever possible to be attain by any human creature as it plainly be not would be entirely incurable and no reason could ever bring us to a state of assurance and conviction upon any subject it must however be confess that this species of scepticism when more moderate may be understand in a very reasonable sense and be a necessary preparative to the study of philosophy by preserve a proper impartiality in our judgements and wean our mind from all those prejudice which we may have imbibe from education or rash opinion to begin with clear and selfevident principles to advance by timorous and sure step to review frequently our conclusions and examine accurately all their consequences though by these mean we shall make both a slow and a short progress in our systems be the only methods by which we can ever hope to reach truth and attain a proper stability and certainty in our determinations there be another species of scepticism consequent to science and enquiry when men be suppose to have discover either the absolute fallaciousness of their mental faculties or their unfitness to reach any fix determination in all those curious subject of speculation about which they be commonly employ even our very sense be bring into dispute by a certain species of philosophers and the maxims of common life be subject to the same doubt as the most profound principles or conclusions of metaphysics and theology as these paradoxical tenets if they may be call tenets be to be meet with in some philosophers and the refutation of them in several they naturally excite our curiosity and make us enquire into the arguments on which they may be found need not insist upon the more trite topics employ by the sceptics in all age against the evidence of sense such as those which be derive from the imperfection and fallaciousness of our organs on numberless occasion the crook appearance of an oar in water the various aspects of object accord to their different distance the double image which arise from the press one eye with many other appearances of a like nature these sceptical topics indeed be only sufficient to prove that the sense alone be not implicitly to be depend on but that we must correct their evidence by reason and by considerations derive from the nature of the medium the distance of the object and the disposition of the organ in order to render them within their sphere the proper criteria of truth and falsehood there be other more profound arguments against the sense which admit not of so easy a solution it seem evident that men be carry by a natural instinct or prepossession to repose faith in their sense and that without any reason or even almost before the use of reason we always suppose an external universe which depend not on our perception but would exist though we and every sensible creature be absent or annihilate even the animal creation be govern by a like opinion and preserve this belief of external object in all their thoughts design and action it seem also evident that when men follow this blind and powerful instinct of nature they always suppose the very image present by the sense to be the external object and never entertain any suspicion that the one be nothing but representations of the other this very table which we see white and which we feel hard be believe to exist independent of our perception and to be something external to our mind which perceive it our presence bestow not be on it our absence do not annihilate it it preserve its existence uniform and entire independent of the situation of intelligent be who perceive or contemplate it but this universal and primary opinion of all men be soon destroy by the slightest philosophy which teach us that nothing can ever be present to the mind but an image or perception and that the sense be only the inlets through which these image be convey without be able to produce any immediate intercourse between the mind and the object the table which we see seem to diminish as we remove farther from it but the real table which exist independent of us suffer no alteration it be therefore nothing but its image which be present to the mind these be the obvious dictate of reason and no man who reflect ever doubt that the existences which we consider when we say this house and that tree be nothing but perceptions in the mind and fleet copy or representations of other existences which remain uniform and independent so far then be we necessitate by reason to contradict or depart from the primary instincts of nature and to embrace a new system with regard to the evidence of our sense but here philosophy find herself extremely embarrass when she would justify this new system and obviate the cavil and objections of the sceptics she can no longer plead the infallible and irresistible instinct of nature for that lead us to a quite different system which be acknowledge fallible and even erroneous and to justify this pretend philosophical system by a chain of clear and convince argument or even any appearance of argument exceed the power of all human capacity by what argument can it be prove that the perceptions of the mind must be cause by external object entirely different from them though resemble them if that be possible and could not arise either from the energy of the mind itself or from the suggestion of some invisible and unknown spirit or from some other cause still more unknown to us it be acknowledge that in fact many of these perceptions arise not from anything external as in dream madness and other diseases and nothing can be more inexplicable than the manner in which body should so operate upon mind as ever to convey an image of itself to a substance suppose of so different and even contrary a nature it be a question of fact whether the perceptions of the sense be produce by external object resemble them how shall this question be determine by experience surely as all other question of a like nature but here experience be and must be entirely silent the mind have never anything present to it but the perceptions and can not possibly reach any experience of their connexion with object the supposition of such a connexion be therefore without any foundation in reason to have recourse to the veracity of the supreme be in order to prove the veracity of our sense be surely make a very unexpected circuit if his veracity be at all concern in this matter our sense would be entirely infallible because it be not possible that he can ever deceive not to mention that if the external world be once call in question we shall be at a loss to find arguments by which we may prove the existence of that be or any of his attribute this be a topic therefore in which the profounder and more philosophical sceptics will always triumph when they endeavour to introduce an universal doubt into all subject of human knowledge and enquiry do you follow the instincts and propensities of nature may they say in assent to the veracity of sense but these lead you to believe that the very perception or sensible image be the external object do you disclaim this principle in order to embrace a more rational opinion that the perceptions be only representations of something external you here depart from your natural propensities and more obvious sentiments and yet be not able to satisfy your reason which can never find any convince argument from experience to prove that the perceptions be connect with any external object there be another sceptical topic of a like nature derive from the most profound philosophy which might merit our attention be it requisite to dive so deep in order to discover arguments and reason which can so little serve to any serious purpose it be universally allow by modern enquirers that all the sensible qualities of object such as hard soft hot cold white black c be merely secondary and exist not in the object themselves but be perceptions of the mind without any external archetype or model which they represent if this be allow with regard to secondary qualities it must also follow with regard to the suppose primary qualities of extension and solidity nor can the latter be any more entitle to that denomination than the former the idea of extension be entirely acquire from the sense of sight and feel and if all the qualities perceive by the sense be in the mind not in the object the same conclusion must reach the idea of extension which be wholly dependent on the sensible ideas or the ideas of secondary qualities nothing can save us from this conclusion but the assert that the ideas of those primary qualities be attain by abstraction an opinion which if we examine it accurately we shall find to be unintelligible and even absurd an extension that be neither tangible nor visible can not possibly be conceive and a tangible or visible extension which be neither hard nor soft black nor white be equally beyond the reach of human conception let any man try to conceive a triangle in general which be neither isosceles nor scalenum nor have any particular length or proportion of side and he will soon perceive the absurdity of all the scholastic notions with regard to abstraction and general ideas thus the first philosophical objection to the evidence of sense or to the opinion of external existence consist in this that such an opinion if rest on natural instinct be contrary to reason and if refer to reason be contrary to natural instinct and at the same time carry no rational evidence with it to convince an impartial enquirer the second objection go farther and represent this opinion as contrary to reason at least if it be a principle of reason that all sensible qualities be in the mind not in the object bereave matter of all its intelligible qualities both primary and secondary you in a manner annihilate it and leave only a certain unknown inexplicable something as the cause of our perceptions a notion so imperfect that no sceptic will think it worth while to contend against it part it may seem a very extravagant attempt of the sceptics to destroy reason by argument and ratiocination yet be this the grand scope of all their enquiries and dispute they endeavour to find objections both to our abstract reason and to those which regard matter of fact and existence the chief objection against all abstract reason be derive from the ideas of space and time ideas which in common life and to a careless view be very clear and intelligible but when they pass through the scrutiny of the profound sciences and they be the chief object of these sciences afford principles which seem full of absurdity and contradiction no priestly dogmas invent on purpose to tame and subdue the rebellious reason of mankind ever shock common sense more than the doctrine of the infinitive divisibility of extension with its consequences as they be pompously display by all geometricians and metaphysicians with a kind of triumph and exultation a real quantity infinitely less than any finite quantity contain quantities infinitely less than itself and so on in infinitum this be an edifice so bold and prodigious that it be too weighty for any pretend demonstration to support because it shock the clearest and most natural principles of human reason but what render the matter more extraordinary be that these seemingly absurd opinions be support by a chain of reason the clearest and most natural nor be it possible for us to allow the premise without admit the consequences nothing can be more convince and satisfactory than all the conclusions concern the properties of circle and triangles and yet when these be once receive how can we deny that the angle of contact between a circle and its tangent be infinitely less than any rectilineal angle that as you may increase the diameter of the circle in infinitum this angle of contact become still less even in infinitum and that the angle of contact between other curve and their tangents may be infinitely less than those between any circle and its tangent and so on in infinitum the demonstration of these principles seem as unexceptionable as that which prove the three angle of a triangle to be equal to two right ones though the latter opinion be natural and easy and the former big with contradiction and absurdity reason here seem to be throw into a kind of amazement and suspence which without the suggestions of any sceptic give her a diffidence of herself and of the grind on which she tread she see a full light which illuminate certain place but that light border upon the most profound darkness and between these she be so dazzle and confound that she scarcely can pronounce with certainty and assurance concern any one object the absurdity of these bold determinations of the abstract sciences seem to become if possible still more palpable with regard to time than extension an infinite number of real part of time pass in succession and exhaust one after another appear so evident a contradiction that no man one should think whose judgement be not corrupt instead of be improve by the sciences would ever be able to admit of it yet still reason must remain restless and unquiet even with regard to that scepticism to which she be drive by these seem absurdities and contradictions how any clear distinct idea can contain circumstances contradictory to itself or to any other clear distinct idea be absolutely incomprehensible and be perhaps as absurd as any proposition which can be form so that nothing can be more sceptical or more full of doubt and hesitation than this scepticism itself which arise from some of the paradoxical conclusions of geometry or the science of quantity the sceptical objections to moral evidence or to the reason concern matter of fact be either popular or philosophical the popular objections be derive from the natural weakness of human understand the contradictory opinions which have be entertain in different age and nations the variations of our judgement in sickness and health youth and old age prosperity and adversity the perpetual contradiction of each particular man opinions and sentiments with many other topics of that kind it be needle to insist farther on this head these objections be but weak for as in common life we reason every moment concern fact and existence and can not possibly subsist without continually employ this species of argument any popular objections derive from thence must be insufficient to destroy that evidence the great subverter of pyrrhonism or the excessive principles of scepticism be action and employment and the occupations of common life these principles may flourish and triumph in the school where it be indeed difficult if not impossible to refute them but as soon as they leave the shade and by the presence of the real object which actuate our passions and sentiments be put in opposition to the more powerful principles of our nature they vanish like smoke and leave the most determine sceptic in the same condition as other mortals the sceptic therefore have better keep within his proper sphere and display those philosophical objections which arise from more profound research here he seem to have ample matter of triumph while he justly insist that all our evidence for any matter of fact which lie beyond the testimony of sense or memory be derive entirely from the relation of cause and effect that we have no other idea of this relation than that of two object which have be frequently conjoin together that we have no argument to convince us that object which have in our experience be frequently conjoin will likewise in other instance be conjoin in the same manner and that nothing lead us to this inference but custom or a certain instinct of our nature which it be indeed difficult to resist but which like other instincts may be fallacious and deceitful while the sceptic insist upon these topics he show his force or rather indeed his own and our weakness and seem for the time at least to destroy all assurance and conviction these arguments might be display at greater length if any durable good or benefit to society could ever be expect to result from them for here be the chief and most confound objection to excessive scepticism that no durable good can ever result from it while it remain in its full force and vigour we need only ask such a sceptic what his mean be and what he propose by all these curious research he be immediately at a loss and know not what to answer a copernican or ptolemaic who support each his different system of astronomy may hope to produce a conviction which will remain constant and durable with his audience a stoic or epicurean display principles which may not be durable but which have an effect on conduct and behaviour but a pyrrhonian can not expect that his philosophy will have any constant influence on the mind or if it have that its influence would be beneficial to society on the contrary he must acknowledge if he will acknowledge anything that all human life must perish be his principles universally and steadily to prevail all discourse all action would immediately cease and men remain in a total lethargy till the necessities of nature unsatisfied put an end to their miserable existence it be true so fatal an event be very little to be dread nature be always too strong for principle and though a pyrrhonian may throw himself or others into a momentary amazement and confusion by his profound reason the first and most trivial event in life will put to flight all his doubt and scruple and leave him the same in every point of action and speculation with the philosophers of every other sect or with those who never concern themselves in any philosophical research when he awake from his dream he will be the first to join in the laugh against himself and to confess that all his objections be mere amusement and can have no other tendency than to show the whimsical condition of mankind who must act and reason and believe though they be not able by their most diligent enquiry to satisfy themselves concern the foundation of these operations or to remove the objections which may be raise against them part there be indeed a more mitigate scepticism or academical philosophy which may be both durable and useful and which may in part be the result of this pyrrhonism or excessive scepticism when its undistinguished doubt be in some measure correct by common sense and reflection the greater part of mankind be naturally apt to be affirmative and dogmatical in their opinions and while they see object only on one side and have no idea of any counterpoise argument they throw themselves precipitately into the principles to which they be incline nor have they any indulgence for those who entertain opposite sentiments to hesitate or balance perplex their understand check their passion and suspend their action they be therefore impatient till they escape from a state which to them be so uneasy and they think that they could never remove themselves far enough from it by the violence of their affirmations and obstinacy of their belief but could such dogmatical reasoners become sensible of the strange infirmities of human understand even in its most perfect state and when most accurate and cautious in its determinations such a reflection would naturally inspire them with more modesty and reserve and diminish their fond opinion of themselves and their prejudice against antagonists the illiterate may reflect on the disposition of the learn who amidst all the advantage of study and reflection be commonly still diffident in their determinations and if any of the learn be incline from their natural temper to haughtiness and obstinacy a small tincture of pyrrhonism might abate their pride by show them that the few advantage which they may have attain over their fellows be but inconsiderable if compare with the universal perplexity and confusion which be inherent in human nature in general there be a degree of doubt and caution and modesty which in all kinds of scrutiny and decision ought for ever to accompany a just reasoner another species of mitigate scepticism which may be of advantage to mankind and which may be the natural result of the pyrrhonian doubt and scruple be the limitation of our enquiries to such subject as be best adapt to the narrow capacity of human understand the imagination of man be naturally sublime delight with whatever be re mote and extraordinary and run without control into the most distant part of space and time in order to avoid the object which custom have render too familiar to it a correct judgement observe a contrary method and avoid all distant and high enquiries confine itself to common life and to such subject as fall under daily practice and experience leave the more sublime topics to the embellishment of poets and orators or to the arts of priests and politicians to bring us to so salutary a determination nothing can be more serviceable than to be once thoroughly convince of the force of the pyrrhonian doubt and of the impossibility that anything but the strong power of natural instinct could free us from it those who have a propensity to philosophy will still continue their research because they reflect that besides the immediate pleasure attend such an occupation philosophical decisions be nothing but the reflections of common life methodized and correct but they will never be tempt to go beyond common life so long as they consider the imperfection of those faculties which they employ their narrow reach and their inaccurate operations while we can not give a satisfactory reason why we believe after a thousand experiment that a stone will fall or fire burn can we ever satisfy ourselves concern any determination which we may form with regard to the origin of worlds and the situation of nature from and to eternity this narrow limitation indeed of our enquiries be in every respect so reasonable that it suffice to make the slightest examination into the natural power of the human mind and to compare them with their object in order to recommend it to us we shall then find what be the proper subject of science and enquiry it seem to me that the only object of the abstract science or of demonstration be quantity and number and that all attempt to extend this more perfect species of knowledge beyond these bound be mere sophistry and illusion as the component part of quantity and number be entirely similar their relations become intricate and involve and nothing can be more curious as well as useful than to trace by a variety of mediums their equality or inequality through their different appearances but as all other ideas be clearly distinct and different from each other we can never advance farther by our utmost scrutiny than to observe this diversity and by an obvious reflection pronounce one thing not to be another or if there be any difficulty in these decisions it proceed entirely from the undeterminate mean of word which be correct by juster definitions that the square of the hypothenuse be equal to the square of the other two side can not be know let the term be ever so exactly define without a train of reason and enquiry but to convince us of this proposition that where there be no property there can be no injustice it be only necessary to define the term and explain injustice to be a violation of property this proposition be indeed nothing but a more imperfect definition it be the same case with all those pretend syllogistical reason which may be find in every other branch of learn except the sciences of quantity and number and these may safely think be pronounce the only proper object of knowledge and demonstration all other enquiries of men regard only matter of fact and existence and these be evidently incapable of demonstration whatever be may not be no negation of a fact can involve a contradiction the nonexistence of any be without exception be as clear and distinct an idea as its existence the proposition which affirm it not to be however false be no less conceivable and intelligible than that which affirm it to be the case be different with the sciences properly so call every proposition which be not true be there confuse and unintelligible that the cube root of be equal to the half of be a false proposition and can never be distinctly conceive but that caesar or the angel gabriel or any be never exist may be a false proposition but still be perfectly conceivable and imply no contradiction the existence therefore of any be can only be prove by arguments from its cause or its effect and these arguments be found entirely on experience if we reason a priori anything may appear able to produce anything the fall of a pebble may for aught we know extinguish the sun or the wish of a man control the planets in their orbit it be only experience which teach us the nature and bound of cause and effect and enable us to infer the existence of one object from that of another such be the foundation of moral reason which form the greater part of human knowledge and be the source of all human action and behaviour moral reason be either concern particular or general facts all deliberations in life regard the former as also all disquisitions in history chronology geography and astronomy the sciences which treat of general facts be politics natural philosophy physic chemistry c where the qualities cause and effect of a whole species of object be enquire into divinity or theology as it prove the existence of a deity and the immortality of souls be compose partly of reason concern particular partly concern general facts it have a foundation in reason so far as it be support by experience but its best and most solid foundation be faith and divine revelation morals and criticism be not so properly object of the understand as of taste and sentiment beauty whether moral or natural be felt more properly than perceive or if we reason concern it and endeavor to fix its standard we regard a new fact to wit the general taste of mankind or some such fact which may be the object of reason and enquiry when we run over libraries persuade of these principles what havoc must we make if we take in our hand any volume of divinity or school metaphysics for instance let us ask do it contain any abstract reason concern quantity or number no do it contain any experimental reason concern matter of fact and existence no commit it then to the flame for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion the end note it be probable that no more be mean by those who deny innate ideas than that all ideas be copy of our impressions though it must be confess that the term which they employ be not choose with such caution nor so exactly define as to prevent all mistake about their doctrine for what be mean by innate if innate be equivalent to natural then all the perceptions and ideas of the mind must be allow to be innate or natural in whatever sense we take the latter word whether in opposition to what be uncommon artificial or miraculous if by innate be mean contemporary to our birth the dispute seem to be frivolous nor be it worth while to enquire at what time think begin whether before at or after our birth again the word idea seem to be commonly take in a very loose sense by locke and others as stand for any of our perceptions our sensations and passions as well as thoughts now in this sense should desire to know what can be mean by assert that selflove or resentment of injuries or the passion between the sex be not innate resemblance contiguity cause and effect for instance contrast or contrariety be also a connexion among ideas but it may perhaps be consider as a mixture of causation and resemblance where two object be contrary the one destroy the other that be the cause of its annihilation and the idea of the annihilation of an object imply the idea of its former existence the word power be here use in a loose and popular sense the more accurate explication of it would give additional evidence to this argument see sect nothing be more useful than for writers even on moral political or physical subject to distinguish between reason and experience and to suppose that these species of argumentation be entirely different from each other the former be take for the mere result of our intellectual faculties which by consider priori the nature of things and examine the effect that must follow from their operation establish particular principles of science and philosophy the latter be suppose to be derive entirely from sense and observation by which we learn what have actually result from the operation of particular object and be thence able to infer what will for the future result from them thus for instance the limitations and restraints of civil government and a legal constitution may be defend either from reason which reflect on the great frailty and corruption of human nature teach that no man can safely be trust with unlimited authority or from experience and history which inform us of the enormous abuse that ambition in every age and country have be find to make of so imprudent a confidence naturane nobis inquit datum dicam an errore

mr locke divide all arguments into demonstrative and probable in this view we must say that it be only probable all men must die or that the sun will rise tomorrow but to conform our language more to common use we ought to divide arguments into demonstrations proof and probabilities by proof mean such arguments from experience as leave no room for doubt or opposition section mr locke in his chapter of power say that find from experience that there be several new productions in matter and conclude that there must somewhere be a power capable of produce them we arrive at last by this reason at the idea of power but no reason can ever give us a new original simple idea as this philosopher himself confess this therefore can never be the origin of that idea it may be pretend that the resistance which we meet with in body oblige us frequently to exert our force and call up all our power this give us the idea of force and power it be this nisus or strong endeavour of which we be conscious that be the original impression from which this idea be copy but first we attribute power to a vast number of object where we never can suppose this resistance of exertion of force to take place to the supreme be who never meet with any resistance to the mind in its command over its ideas and limbs in common think and motion where the effect follow immediately upon the will without any exertion or summon up of force to inanimate matter which be not capable of this sentiment secondly this sentiment of an endeavour to overcome resistance have no know connexion with any event what follow it we know by experience but could not know it a priori it must however be confess that the animal nisus which we experience though it can afford no accurate precise idea of power enter very much into that vulgar inaccurate idea which be form of it theos apo mechanes deus ex machina section need not examine at length the vis inertiae which be so much talk of in the new philosophy and which be ascribe to matter we find by experience that a body at rest or in motion continue for ever in its present state till put from it by some new cause and that a body impel take as much motion from the impel body as it acquire itself these be facts when we call this a vis inertiae we only mark these facts without pretend to have any idea of the inert power in the same manner as when we talk of gravity we mean certain effect without comprehend that active power it be never the mean of sir isaac newton to rob second cause of all force or energy though some of his followers have endeavour to establish that theory upon his authority on the contrary that great philosopher have recourse to an etherial active fluid to explain his universal attraction though he be so cautious and modest as to allow that it be a mere hypothesis not to be insist on without more experiment must confess that there be something in the fate of opinions a little extraordinary descartes insinuate that doctrine of the universal and sole efficacy of the deity without insist on it malebranche and other cartesians make it the foundation of all their philosophy it have however no authority in england locke clarke and cudworth never so much as take notice of it but suppose all along that matter have a real though subordinate and derive power by what mean have it become so prevalent among our modern metaphysicians accord to these explications and definitions the idea of power be relative as much as that of cause and both have a reference to an effect or some other event constantly conjoin with the former when we consider the unknown circumstance of an object by which the degree or quantity of its effect be fix and determine we call that its power and accordingly it be allow by all philosophers that the effect be the measure of the power but if they have any idea of power as it be in itself why could not they measure it in itself the dispute whether the force of a body in motion be as its velocity or the square of its velocity this dispute say need not be decide by compare its effect in equal or unequal time but by a direct mensuration and comparison the prevalence of the doctrine of liberty may be account for from another cause viz a false sensation or seem experience which we have or may have of liberty or indifference in many of our action the necessity of any action whether of matter or of mind be not properly speak a quality in the agent but in any think or intel ligent be who may consider the action and it consist chiefly in the determination of his thoughts to infer the existence of that action from some precede object as liberty when oppose to necessity be nothing but the want of that determination and a certain loosen or indifference which we feel in pass or not pass from the idea of one object to that of any succeed one now we may observe that though in reflect on human action we seldom feel such a loosen or indifference but be commonly able to infer them with considerable certainty from their motives and from the dispositions of the agent yet it frequently happen that in perform the action themselves we be sensible of something like it and as all resemble object be readily take for each other this have be employ as a demonstrative and even intuitive proof of human liberty we feel that our action be subject to our will on most occasion and imagine we feel that the will itself be subject to nothing because when by a denial of it we be provoke to try we feel that it move easily every way and produce an image of itself or a velleity as it be call in the school even on that side on which it do not settle this image or faint motion we persuade ourselves could at that time have be compleated into the thing itself because should that be deny we find upon a second trial that at present it can we consider not that the fantastical desire of shew liberty be here the motive of our action and it seem certain that however we may imagine we feel a liberty within ourselves a spectator can commonly infer our action from our motives and character and even where he can not he conclude in general that he might be he perfectly acquaint with every circumstance of our situation and temper and the most secret spring of our complexion and disposition now this be the very essence of necessity accord to the forego doctrine thus if a cause be define that which produce any thing it be easy to observe that produce be synonimous to cause in like manner if a cause be define that by which any thing exist this be liable to the same objection for what be mean by these word by which have it be say that a cause be that after which any thing constantly exist we should have understand the term for this be indeed all we know of the matter and this constancy form the very essence of necessity nor have we any other idea of it since all reason concern facts or cause be derive merely from custom it may be ask how it happen that men so much surpass animals in reason and one man so much surpass another have not the same custom the same influence on all plutarch marcus cato no indian it be evident could have experience that water do not freeze in cold climates this be place nature in a situation quite unknown to him and it be impossible for him to tell a priori what will result from it it be make a new experiment the consequence of which be always uncertain one may sometimes conjecture from analogy what will follow but still this be but conjecture and it must be confess that in the present case of freeze the event follow contrary to the rule of analogy and be such as a rational indian would not look for the operations of cold upon water be not gradual accord to the degrees of cold but whenever it come to the freeze point the water pass in a moment from the utmost liquidity to perfect hardness such an event therefore may be denominate extraordinary and require a pretty strong testimony to render it credible to people in a war climate but still it be not miraculous nor contrary to uniform experience of the course of nature in case where all the circumstances be the same the inhabitants of sumatra have always see water fluid in their own climate and the freeze of their rivers ought to be deem a prodigy but they never saw water in muscovy during the winter and therefore they can not reasonably be positive what would there be the consequence sometimes an event may not in itself seem to be contrary to the laws of nature and yet if it be real it might by reason of some circumstances be denominate a miracle because in fact it be contrary to these laws thus if a person claim a divine authority should command a sick person to be well a healthful man to fall down dead the cloud to pour rain the wind to blow in short should order many natural events which immediately follow upon his command these might justly be esteem miracles because they be really in this case contrary to the laws of nature for if any suspicion remain that the event and command concur by accident there be no miracle and no transgression of the laws of nature if this suspicion be remove there be evidently a miracle and a transgression of these laws because nothing can be more contrary to nature than that the voice or command of a man should have such an influence a miracle may be accurately define a transgression of a law of nature by a particular volition of the deity or by the interposition of some invisible agent a miracle may either be discoverable by men or not this alter not its nature and essence the raise of a house or ship into the air be a visible miracle the raise of a feather when the wind want ever so little of a force requisite for that purpose be as real a miracle though not so sensible with regard to us histories iv suetonius give nearly the same account live of the caesars vespasian lucretius novum organum aph lucian sump e lapithai the banquet or the lapiths lucian eunouchos the eunuch lucian and dio in general it may think be establish as a maxim that where any cause be know only by its particular effect it must be impossible to infer any new effect from that cause since the qualities which be requisite to produce these new effect along with the former must either be different or superior or of more extensive operation than those which simply produce the effect whence alone the cause be suppose to be know to us we can never therefore have any reason to suppose the existence of these qualities to say that the new effect proceed only from a continuation of the same energy which be already know from the first effect will not remove the difficulty for even grant this to be the case which can seldom be suppose the very continuation and exertion of a like energy for it be impossible it can be absolutely the same say this exertion of a like energy in a different period of space and time be a very arbitrary supposition and what there can not possibly be any trace of in the effect from which all our knowledge of the cause be originally derive let the infer cause be exactly proportion as it should be to the know effect and it be impossible that it can possess any qualities from which new or different effect can be infer this argument be draw from dr berkeley and indeed most of the write of that very ingenious author form the best lessons of scepticism which be to be find either among the ancient or modern philosophers bayle not except he profess however in his title page and undoubtedly with great truth to have compose his book against the sceptics as well as against the atheists and freethinkers but that all his arguments though otherwise intend be in reality merely sceptical appear from this that they admit of no answer and produce no conviction their only effect be to cause that momentary amazement and irresolution and confusion which be the result of scepticism whatever dispute there may be about mathematical point we must allow that there be physical point that be part of extension which can not be divide or lessen either by the eye or imagination these image then which be present to the fancy or sense be absolutely indivisible and consequently must be allow by mathematicians to be infinitely less than any real part of extension and yet nothing appear more certain to reason than that an infinite number of them compose an infinite extension how much more an infinite number of those infinitely small part of extension which be still suppose infinitely divisible it seem to me not impossible to avoid these absurdities and contradictions if it be admit that there be no such thing as abstract or general ideas properly speak but that all general ideas be in reality particular ones attach to a general term which recall upon occasion other particular ones that resemble in certain circumstances the idea present to the mind thus when the term horse be pronounce we immediately figure to ourselves the idea of a black or a white animal of a particular size or figure but as that term be also usually apply to animals of other colour figure and size these ideas though not actually present to the imagination be easily recall and our reason and conclusion proceed in the same way as if they be actually present if this be admit as seem reasonable it follow that all the ideas of quantity upon which mathematicians reason be nothing but particular and such as be suggest by the sense and imagination and consequently can not be infinitely divisible it be sufficient to have drop this hint at present without prosecute it any farther it certainly concern all lovers of science not to expose themselves to the ridicule and contempt of the ignorant by their conclusions and this seem the readiest solution of these difficulties that impious maxim of the ancient philosophy ex nihilo nihil fit by which the creation of matter be exclude cease to be a maxim accord to this philosophy not only the will of the supreme be may create matter but for aught we know a priori the will of any other be might create it or any other cause that the most whimsical imagination can assign
