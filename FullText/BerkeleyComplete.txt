a treatise concern the principles of human knowledge wherein the chief cause of error and difficulty in the sciences with the ground of scepticism atheism and irreligion be inquire into first print in the year to which be add three dialogues between hylas and philonous in opposition to scepticks and atheists first print in the year both write by george berkeley a fellow of trinitycollege dublin london print for jacob tonson introduction philosophy be nothing else but the study of wisdom and truth it may with reason be expect that those who have spend most time and pain in it should enjoy a greater calm and serenity of mind a greater clearness and evidence of knowledge and be less disturb with doubt and difficulties than other men yet so it be we see the illiterate bulk of mankind that walk the highroad of plain common sense and be govern by the dictate of nature for the most part easy and undisturbed to them nothing thats familiar appear unaccountable or difficult to comprehend they complain not of any want of evidence in their sense and be out of all danger of become sceptics but no sooner do we depart from sense and instinct to follow the light of a superior principle to reason meditate and reflect on the nature of things but a thousand scruple spring up in our mind concern those things which before we seem fully to comprehend prejudice and errors of sense do from all part discover themselves to our view and endeavour to correct these by reason we be insensibly draw into uncouth paradoxes difficulties and inconsistencies which multiply and grow upon us as we advance in speculation till at length have wanderd through many intricate mazes we find our selves just where we be or which be worse sit down in a forlorn scepticism the cause of this be think to be the obscurity of things or the natural weakness and imperfection of our understand it be say the faculties we have be few and those design by nature for the support and comfort of life and not to penetrate into the inward essence and constitution of things besides the mind of man be finite when it treat of things which partake of infinity it be not to be wonder at if it run into absurdities and contradictions out of which it be impossible it should ever extricate it self it be of the nature of infinite not to be comprehend by that which be finite but perhaps we may be too partial to our selves in place the fault originally in our faculties and not rather in the wrong use we make of them it be a hard thing to suppose that right deductions from true principles should ever end in consequences which can not be maintain or make consistent we should believe that god have deal more bountifully with the sons of men than to give them a strong desire for that knowledge which he have place quite out of their reach this be not agreeable to the wonted indulgent methods of providence which whatever appetites it may have implant in the creatures doth usually furnish them with such mean as if rightly make use of will not fail to satisfy them upon the whole i be incline to think that the far greater part if not all of those difficulties which have hitherto amusd philosophers and blockd up the way to knowledge be intirely owe to our selves that we have first raisd a dust and then complain we can not see my purpose therefore be to try if i can discover what those principles be which have introduce all that doubtfulness and uncertainty those absurdities and contradictions into the several sects of philosophy insomuch that the wisest men have think our ignorance incurable conceive it to arise from the natural dulness and limitation of our faculties and surely it be a work well deserve our pain to make a strict inquiry concern the first principles of humane knowledge to sift and examine them on all side especially since there may be some ground to suspect that those let and difficulties which stay and embarass the mind in its search after truth do not spring from any darkness and intricacy in the object or natural defect in the understand so much as from false principles which have be insist on and might have be avoid how difficult and discourage soever this attempt may seem when i consider how many great and extraordinary men have go before me in the same design yet i be not without some hop upon the consideration that the largest view be not always the clearest and that he who be shortsighted will be oblige to draw the object nearer and may perhaps by a close and narrow survey discern that which have escape far better eye in order to prepare the mind of the reader for the easier conceive what follow it be proper to premise somewhat by way of introduction concern the nature and abuse of language but the unravel this matter lead me in some measure to anticipate my design by take notice of what seem to have have a chief part in render speculation intricate and perplex and to have occasion innumerable errors and difficulties in almost all part of knowledge and that be the opinion that the mind hath a power of frame abstract ideas or notions of things he who be not a perfect stranger to the write and dispute of philosophers must need acknowledge that no small part of them be spend about abstract ideas these be in a more especial manner think to be the object of those sciences which go by the name of logic and metaphysics and of all that which pass under the notion of the most abstract and sublime learn in all which one shall scarce find any question handle in such a manner as do not suppose their existence in the mind and that it be well acquaint with them it be agree on all hand that the qualities or modes of things do never really exist each of them apart by it self and separate from all others but be mixd as it be and blend together several in the same object but we be tell the mind be able to consider each quality singly or abstract from those other qualities with which it be unite do by that mean frame to it self abstract ideas for example there be perceive by sight an object extend colour and move this mixd or compound idea the mind resolve into its simple constituent part and view each by it self exclusive of the rest do frame the abstract ideas of extension colour and motion not that it be possible for colour or motion to exist without extension but only that the mind can frame to it self by abstraction the idea of colour exclusive of extension and of motion exclusive of both colour and extension again the mind have observe that in the particular extensions perceivd by sense there be something common and alike in all and some other things peculiar as this or that figure or magnitude which distinguish them one from another it consider apart or single out by it self that which be common make thereof a most abstract idea of extension which be neither line surface nor solid nor have any figure or magnitude but be an idea intirely prescinded from all these so likewise the mind by leave out of the particular colour perceive by sense that which distinguish them one from another and retain that only which be common to all make an idea of colour in abstract which be neither red nor blue nor white nor any other determinate colour and in like manner by consider motion abstractedly not only from the body move but likewise from the figure it describe and all particular directions and velocities the abstract idea of motion be frame which equally correspond to all particular motion whatsoever that may be perceive by sense and as the mind frame to it self abstract ideas of qualities or modes so do it by the same precision or mental separation attain abstract ideas of the more compound be which include several coexistent qualities for example the mind have observe that peter jam and john resemble each other in certain common agreements of shape and other qualities leave out of the complex or compound idea it have of peter jam and any other particular man that which be peculiar to each retain only what be common to all and so make an abstract idea wherein all the particulars equally partake abstract intirely from and cut off all those circumstances and differences which might determine it to any particular existence and after this manner it be say we come by the abstract idea of man or if you please humanity or humane nature wherein it be true there be include colour because there be no man but have some colour but then it can be neither white nor black nor any particular colour because there be no one particular colour wherein all men partake so likewise there be include stature but then it be neither tall stature nor low stature nor yet middle stature but something abstract from all these and so of the rest moreover there be a great variety of other creatures that partake in some part but not all of the complex idea of man the mind leave out those part which be peculiar to men and retain those only which be common to all the live creatures frameth the idea of animal which abstract not only from all particular men but also all bird beasts fish and insects the constituent part of the abstract idea of animal be body life sense and spontaneous motion by body be mean body without any particular shape or figure there be no one shape or figure common to all animals without cover either of hair or feather or scale c nor yet naked hair feather scale and nakedness be the distinguish properties of particular animals and for that reason leave out of the abstract idea upon the same account the spontaneous motion must be neither walk nor fly nor creep it be nevertheless a motion but what that motion be it be not easy to conceive whether others have this wonderful faculty of abstract their ideas they best can tell for my self i find indeed i have a faculty of imagine or represent to myself the ideas of those particular things i have perceive and of variously compound and divide them i can imagine a man with two head or the upper part of a man join to the body of a horse i can consider the hand the eye the nose each by it self abstract or separate from the rest of the body but then whatever hand or eye i imagine it must have some particular shape and colour likewise the idea of man that i frame to my self must be either of a white or a black or a tawny a straight or a crook a tall or a low or a middlesized man i can not by any effort of think conceive the abstract idea above describe and it be equally impossible for me to form the abstract idea of motion distinct from the body move and which be neither swift nor slow curvilinear nor rectilinear and the like may be say of all other abstract general ideas whatsoever to be plain i own my self able to abstract in one sense as when i consider some particular part or qualities separate from others with which though they be unite in some object yet it be possible they may really exist without them but i deny that i can abstract one from another or conceive separately those qualities which it be impossible should exist so separate or that i can frame a general notion by abstract from particulars in the manner aforesaid which two last be the proper acceptations of abstraction and there be ground to think most men will acknowledge themselves to be in my case the generality of men which be simple and illiterate never pretend to abstract notions it be say they be difficult and not to be attain without pain and study we may therefore reasonably conclude that if such there be they be confine only to the learn i proceed to examine what can be alledged in defence of the doctrine of abstraction and try if i can discover what it be that incline the men of speculation to embrace an opinion so remote from common sense as that seem to be there have be a late deservedly esteem philosopher who no doubt have give it very much countenance by seem to think the have abstract general ideas be what put the widest difference in point of understand betwixt man and beast the have of general ideas saith he be that which put a perfect distinction betwixt man and brutes and be an excellency which the faculties of brutes do by no mean attain unto for it be evident we observe no footsteps in them of make use of general sign for universal ideas from which we have reason to imagine that they have not the faculty of abstract or make general ideas since they have no use of word or any other general sign and a little after therefore i think we may suppose that it be in this that the species of brutes be discriminate from men and tis that proper difference wherein they be wholly separate and which at last widen to so wide a distance for if they have any ideas at all and be not bare machine as some would have them we can not deny them to have some reason it seem as evident to me that they do some of them in certain instance reason as that they have sense but it be only in particular ideas just as they receive them from their sense they be the best of them tie up within those narrow bound and have not as i think the faculty to enlarge them by any kind of abstraction essay on hum underst b sect and i readily agree with this learn author that the faculties of brutes can by no mean attain to abstraction but then if this be make the distinguish property of that sort of animals i fear a great many of those that pass for men must be reckon into their number the reason that be here assign why we have no ground to think brutes have abstract general ideas be that we observe in them no use of word or any other general sign which be build on this supposition to wit that the make use of word imply the have general ideas from which it follow that men who use language be able to abstract or generalize their ideas that this be the sense and argue of the author will further appear by his answer the question he in another place put since all things that exist be only particulars how come we by general term his answer be word become general by be make the sign of general ideas essay on hum underst b sect but it seem that a word become general by be make the sign not of an abstract general idea but of several particular ideas any one of which it indifferently suggest to the mind for example when it be say the change of motion be proportional to the impress force or that whatever have extension be divisible these proposition be to be understand of motion and extension in general and nevertheless it will not follow that they suggest to my thoughts an idea of motion without a body move or any determinate direction and velocity or that i must conceive an abstract general idea of extension which be neither line surface nor solid neither great nor small black white nor red nor of any other determinate colour it be only imply that whatever motion i consider whether it be swift or slow perpendicular horizontal or oblique or in whatever object the axiom concern it hold equally true as do the other of every particular extension it matter not whether line surface or solid whether of this or that magnitude or figure by observe how ideas become general we may the better judge how word be make so and here it be to be note that i do not deny absolutely there be general ideas but only that there be any abstract general ideas for in the passages above quote wherein there be mention of general ideas it be always suppose that they be form by abstraction after the manner set forth in sect viii and now if we will annex a mean to our word and speak only of what we can conceive i believe we shall acknowledge that an idea which consider in it self be particular become general by be make to represent or stand for all other particular ideas of the same sort to make this plain by an example suppose a geometrician be demonstrate the method of cut a line in two equal part he draw for instance a black line of an inch in length this which in it self be a particular line be nevertheless with regard to its signification general since as it be there use it represent all particular line whatsoever so that what be demonstrate of it be demonstrate of all line or in other word of a line in general and as that particular line become general by be make a sign so the name line which take absolutely be particular by be a sign be make general and as the former owe its generality not to its be the sign of an abstract or general line but of all particular right line that may possibly exist so the latter must be think to derive its generality from the same cause namely the various particular line which it indifferently denote to give the reader a yet clearer view of the nature of abstract ideas and the use they be think necessary to i shall add one more passage out of the essay on human understand which be as follow abstract ideas be not so obvious or easy to children or the yet unexercised mind as particular ones if they seem so to grow men it be only because by constant and familiar use they be make so for when we nicely reflect upon them we shall find that general ideas be fictions and contrivances of the mind that carry difficulty with them and do not so easily offer themselves as we be apt to imagine for example do it not require some pain and skill to form the general idea of a triangle which be yet none of the most abstract comprehensive and difficult for it must be neither oblique nor rectangle neither equilateral equicrural nor scalenon but all and none of these at once in effect it be something imperfect that can not exist an idea wherein some part of several different and inconsistent ideas be put together it be true the mind in this imperfect state have need of such ideas and make all the haste to them it can for the conveniency of communication and enlargement of knowledge to both which it be naturally very much incline but yet one have reason to suspect such ideas be mark of our imperfection at least this be enough to shew that the most abstract and general ideas be not those that the mind be first and most easily acquaint with nor such as its earliest knowledge be conversant about b sect if any man have the faculty of frame in his mind such an idea of a triangle as be here describe it be in vain to pretend to dispute him out of it nor would i go about it all i desire be that the reader would fully and certainly inform himself whether he have such an idea or no and this methinks can be no hard task for anyone to perform what more easy than for anyone to look a little into his own thoughts and there try whether he have or can attain to have an idea that shall correspond with the description that be here give of the general idea of a triangle which be neither oblique nor rectangle equilateral equicrural nor scalenon but all and none of these at once much be here say of the difficulty that abstract ideas carry with them and the pain and skill requisite to the form them and it be on all hand agree that there be need of great toil and labour of the mind to emancipate our thoughts from particular object and raise them to those sublime speculations that be conversant about abstract ideas from all which the natural consequence should seem to be that so difficult a thing as the form abstract ideas be not necessary for communication which be so easy and familiar to all sort of men but we be tell if they seem obvious and easy to grow men it be only because by constant and familiar use they be make so now i would fain know at what time it be men be imployed in surmount that difficulty and furnish themselves with those necessary help for discourse it can not be when they be grow up for then it seem they be not conscious of any such painstaking it remain therefore to be the business of their childhood and surely the great and multiply labour of frame abstract notions will be find a hard task for that tender age be it not a hard thing to imagine that a couple of children can not prate together of their sugarplumbs and rattle and the rest of their little trinkets till they have first tack together numberless inconsistencies and so frame in their mind abstract general ideas and annex them to every common name they make use of nor do i think them a whit more needful for the enlargement of knowledge than for communication it be i know a point much insist on that all knowledge and demonstration be about universal notions to which i fully agree but then it doth not appear to me that those notions be form by abstraction in the manner premise universality so far as i can comprehend not consist in the absolute positive nature or conception of any thing but in the relation it bear to the particulars signify or represent by it by virtue whereof it be that things name or notions be in their own nature particular be render universal thus when i demonstrate any proposition concern triangles it be to be suppose that i have in view the universal idea of a triangle which ought not to be understand as if i could frame an idea of a triangle which be neither equilateral nor scalenon nor equicrural but only that the particular triangle i consider whether of this or that sort it matter not doth equally stand for and represent all rectilinear triangles whatsoever and be in that sense universal all which seem very plain and not to include any difficulty in it but here it will be demand how we can know any proposition to be true of all particular triangles except we have first see it demonstrate of the abstract idea of a triangle which equally agree to all for because a property may be demonstrate to agree to some one particular triangle it will not thence follow that it equally belong to any other triangle which in all respect be not the same with it for example have demonstrate that the three angle of an isosceles rectangular triangle be equal to two right ones i can not therefore conclude this affection agree to all other triangles which have neither a right angle nor two equal side it seem therefore that to be certain this proposition be universally true we must either make a particular demonstration for every particular triangle which be impossible or once for all demonstrate it of the abstract idea of a triangle in which all the particulars do indifferently partake and by which they be all equally represent to which i answer that though the idea i have in view whilst i make the demonstration be for instance that of an isosceles rectangular triangle whose side be of a determinate length i may nevertheless be certain it extend to all other rectilinear triangles of what sort or bigness soever and that because neither the right angle nor the equality nor determinate length of the side be at all concern in the demonstration it be true the diagram i have in view include all these particulars but then there be not the least mention make of them in the proof of the proposition it be not say the three angle be equal to two right ones because one of them be a right angle or because the side comprehend it be of the same length which sufficiently shew that the right angle might have be oblique and the side unequal and for all that the demonstration have hold good and for this reason it be that i conclude that to be true of any obliquangular or scalenon which i have demonstrate of a particular rightangled equicrural triangle and not because i demonstrate the proposition of the abstract idea of a triangle and here it must be acknowledge that a man may consider a figure merely as triangular without attend to the particular qualities of the angle or relations of the side so far he may abstract but this will never prove that he can frame an abstract general inconsistent idea of a triangle in like manner we may consider peter so far forth as man or so far forth as animal without frame the forementioned abstract idea either of man or of animal in as much as all that be perceive be not consider it be an endless as well as an useless thing to trace the schoolmen those great master of abstraction through all the manifold inextricable labyrinths of error and dispute which their doctrine of abstract natures and notions seem to have lead them into what bicker and controversies and what a learn dust have be raise about those matter and what mighty advantage hath be from thence derive to mankind be things at this day too clearly know to need be insist on and it have be well if the ill effect of that doctrine be confine to those only who make the most avow profession of it when men consider the great pain industry and part that have for so many age be lay out on the cultivation and advancement of the sciences and that notwithstanding all this the far greater part of them remain full of darkness and uncertainty and dispute that be like never to have an end and even those that be think to be support by the most clear and cogent demonstrations contain in them paradoxes which be perfectly irreconcilable to the understand of men and that take all together a small portion of them doth supply any real benefit to mankind otherwise than by be an innocent diversion and amusement i say the consideration of all this be apt to throw them into a despondency and perfect contempt of all study but this may perhaps cease upon a view of the false principles that have obtain in the world amongst all which there be none methinks hath a more wide influence over the thoughts of speculative men than this of abstract general ideas i come now to consider the source of this prevail notion and that seem to me to be language and surely nothing of less extent than reason it self could have be the source of an opinion so universally receive the truth of this appear as from other reason so also from the plain confession of the ablest patrons of abstract ideas who acknowledge that they be make in order to name from which it be a clear consequence that if there have be no such thing as speech or universal sign there never have be any think of abstraction see b sect and elsewhere of the essay on human understand let us therefore examine the manner wherein word have contribute to the origin of that mistake first then tis think that every name hath or ought to have one only precise and settle signification which incline men to think there be certain abstract determinate ideas which constitute the true and only immediate signification of each general name and that it be by the mediation of these abstract ideas that a general name come to signify any particular thing whereas in truth there be no such thing as one precise and definite signification annex to any general name they all signify indifferently a great number of particular ideas all which doth evidently follow from what have be already say and will clearly appear to anyone by a little reflexion to this it will be object that every name that have a definition be thereby restrain to one certain signification for example a triangle be define to be a plain surface comprehend by three right line by which that name be limit to denote one certain idea and no other to which i answer that in the definition it be not say whether the surface be great or small black or white nor whether the side be long or short equal or unequal nor with what angle they be incline to each other in all which there may be great variety and consequently there be no one settle idea which limit the signification of the word triangle tis one thing for to keep a name constantly to the same definition and another to make it stand every where for the same idea the one be necessary the other useless and impracticable but to give a farther account how word come to produce the doctrine of abstract ideas it must be observe that it be a receive opinion that language have no other end but the communicate our ideas and that every significant name stand for an idea this be so and it be withal certain that name which yet be not think altogether insignificant do not always mark out particular conceivable ideas it be straightway conclude that they stand for abstract notions that there be many name in use amongst speculative men which do not always suggest to others determinate particular ideas be what no body will deny and a little attention will discover that it be not necessary even in the strictest reason significant name which stand for ideas should every time they be use excite in the understand the ideas they be make to stand for in read and discourse name be for the most part use as letter be in algebra in which though a particular quantity be mark by each letter yet to proceed right it be not requisite that in every step each letter suggest to your thoughts that particular quantity it be appoint to stand for besides the communicate of ideas mark by word be not the chief and only end of language as be commonly suppose there be other end as the raise of some passion the excite to or deter from an action the put the mind in some particular disposition to which the former be in many case barely subservient and sometimes intirely omit when these can be obtain without it as i think doth not unfrequently happen in the familiar use of language i intreat the reader to reflect with himself and see if it doth not often happen either in hear or read a discourse that the passions of fear love hatred admiration disdain and the like arise immediately in his mind upon the perception of certain word without any ideas come between at first indeed the word might have occasion ideas that be fit to produce those emotions but if i mistake not it will be find that when language be once grow familiar the hear of the sound or sight of the character be oft immediately attend with those passions which at first be wont to be produce by the intervention of ideas that be now quite omit may we not for example be affect with the promise of a good thing though we have not an idea of what it be or be not the be threatned with danger sufficient to excite a dread though we think not of any particular evil likely to befal us nor yet frame to our selves an idea of danger in abstract if any one shall join ever so little reflexion of his own to what have be say i believe it will evidently appear to him that general name be often use in the propriety of language without the speakers design them for mark of ideas in his own which he would have them raise in the mind of the hearer even proper name themselves do not seem always speak with a design to bring into our view the ideas of those individuals that be suppose to be mark by them for example when a schoolman tell me aristotle hath say it all i conceive he mean by it be to dispose me to embrace his opinion with the deference and submission which custom have annex to that name and this effect may be so instantly produce in the mind of those who be accustom to resign their judgment to the authority of that philosopher as it be impossible any idea either of his person write or reputation should go before innumerable examples of this kind may be give but why should i insist on those things which every ones experience will i doubt not plentifully suggest unto him we have i think shew the impossibility of abstract ideas we have consider what have be say for them by their ablest patrons and endeavor to shew they be of no use for those end to which they be think necessary and lastly we have trace them to the source from whence they flow which appear to be language it can not be deny that word be of excellent use in that by their mean all that stock of knowledge which have be purchase by the joint labour of inquisitive men in all age and nations may be draw into the view and make the possession of one single person but at the same time it must be own that most part of knowledge have be strangely perplex and darken by the abuse of word and general ways of speech wherein they be deliver since therefore word be so apt to impose on the understand whatever ideas i consider i shall endeavour to take them bare and naked into my view keep out of my thoughts so far as i be able those name which long and constant use hath so strictly unite with them from which i may expect to derive the follow advantage first i shall be sure to get clear of all controversies purely verbal the spring up of which weed in almost all the sciences have be a main hindrance to the growth of true and sound knowledge secondly this seem to be a sure way to extricate my self out of that fine and subtile net of abstract ideas which have so miserably perplex and entangle the mind of men and that with this peculiar circumstance that by how much the finer and more curious be the wit of any man by so much the deeper be he like to be ensnare and faster hold therein thirdly so long as i confine my thoughts to my own ideas divest of word i do not see how i can easily be mistake the object i consider i clearly and adequately know i can not be deceive in think i have an idea which i have not it be not possible for me to imagine that any of my own ideas be alike or unlike that be not truly so to discern the agreements or disagreements there be between my ideas to see what ideas be include in any compound idea and what not there be nothing more requisite than an attentive perception of what pass in my own understand but the attainment of all these advantage doth presuppose an intire deliverance from the deception of word which i dare hardly promise my self so difficult a thing it be to dissolve an union so early begin and confirm by so long a habit as that betwixt word and ideas which difficulty seem to have be very much increase by the doctrine of abstraction for so long as men think abstract ideas be annex to their word it doth not seem strange that they should use word for ideas it be find an impracticable thing to lay aside the word and retain the abstract idea in the mind which in it self be perfectly inconceivable this seem to me the principal cause why those men who have so emphatically recommend to others the lay aside all use of word in their meditations and contemplate their bare ideas have yet fail to perform it themselves of late many have be very sensible of the absurd opinions and insignificant dispute which grow out of the abuse of word and in order to remedy these evils they advise well that we attend to the ideas signify and draw off our attention from the word which signify them but how good soever this advice may be they have give others it be plain they could not have a due regard to it themselves so long as they think the only immediate use of word be to signify ideas and that the immediate signification of every general name be a determinate abstract idea but these be know to be mistake a man may with greater ease prevent his be impose on by word he that know he have no other than particular ideas will not puzzle himself in vain to find out and conceive the abstract idea annex to any name and he that know name do not always stand for ideas will spare himself the labour of look for ideas where there be none to be have it be therefore to be wish that every one would use his utmost endeavour to obtain a clear view of the ideas he would consider separate from them all that dress and incumbrance of word which so much contribute to blind the judgment and divide the attention in vain do we extend our view into the heavens and pry into the entrails of the earth in vain do we consult the write of learn men and trace the dark footsteps of antiquity we need only draw the curtain of word to behold the fairest tree of knowledge whose fruit be excellent and within the reach of our hand unless we take care to clear the first principles of knowledge from the embarras and delusion of word we may make infinite reason upon them to no purpose we may draw consequences from consequences and be never the wiser the farther we go we shall only lose our selves the more irrecoverably and be the deeper entangle in difficulties and mistake whoever therefore design to read the follow sheet i intreat him to make my word the occasion of his own think and endeavour to attain the same train of thoughts in read that i have in write them by this mean it will be easy for him to discover the truth or falsity of what i say he will be out of all danger of be deceive by my word and i do not see how he can be lead into an error by consider his own naked undisguised ideas of the principles of humane knowledge part it be evident to any one who take a survey of the object of humane knowledge that they be either ideas actually imprint on the sense or else such as be perceive by attend to the passions and operations of the mind or lastly ideas form by help of memory and imagination either compound divide or barely represent those originally perceive in the aforesaid ways by sight i have the ideas of light and colour with their several degrees and variations by touch i perceive for example hard and soft heat and cold motion and resistance and of all these more and less either as to quantity or degree smell furnish me with odors the palate with taste and hear convey sound to the mind in all their variety of tone and composition and as several of these be observe to accompany each other they come to be mark by one name and so to be repute as one thing thus for example a certain colour taste smell figure and consistence have be observe to go together be account one distinct thing signify by the name apple other collections of ideas constitute a stone a tree a book and the like sensible things which as they be please or disagreeable excite the passions of love hatred joy grief and so forth but besides all that endless variety of ideas or object of knowledge there be likewise something which know or perceive them and exercise divers operations as will imagine remember about them this perceive active be be what i call mind spirit soul or my self by which word i do not denote any one of my ideas but a thing intirely distinct from them wherein they exist or which be the same thing whereby they be perceive for the existence of an idea consist in be perceive that neither our thoughts nor passions nor ideas form by the imagination exist without the mind be what every body will allow and it seem no less evident that the various sensations or ideas imprint on the sense however blend or combine together that be whatever object they compose can not exist otherwise than in a mind perceive them i think an intuitive knowledge may be obtain of this by any one that shall attend to what be mean by the term exist when apply to sensible things the table i write on i say exist that be i see and feel it and if i be out of my study i should say it exist mean thereby that if i be in my study i might perceive it or that some other spirit actually do perceive it there be an odor that be it be smell there be a sound that be to say it be hear a colour or figure and it be perceive by sight or touch this be all that i can understand by these and the like expressions for as to what be say of the absolute existence of unthinking things without any relation to their be perceive that seem perfectly unintelligible their esse be percipi nor be it possible they should have any existence out of the mind or think things which perceive them it be indeed an opinion strangely prevail amongst men that house mountains rivers and in a word all sensible object have an existence natural or real distinct from their be perceive by the understand but with how great an assurance and acquiescence soever this principle may be entertain in the world yet whoever shall find in his heart to call it in question may if i mistake not perceive it to involve a manifest contradiction for what be the forementioned object but the things we perceive by sense and what do we perceive besides our own ideas or sensations and be it not plainly repugnant that any one of these or any combination of them should exist unperceived if we thoroughly examine this tenet it will perhaps be find at bottom to depend on the doctrine of abstract ideas for can there be a nicer strain of abstraction than to distinguish the existence of sensible object from their be perceive so as to conceive them exist unperceived light and colour heat and cold extension and figure in a word the things we see and feel what be they but so many sensations notions ideas or impressions on the sense and be it possible to separate even in think any of these from perception for my part i might as easily divide a thing from it self i may indeed divide in my thoughts or conceive apart from each other those things which perhaps i never perceive by sense so divide thus i imagine the trunk of a humane body without the limbs or conceive the smell of a rise without think on the rise it self so far i will not deny i can abstract if that may properly be call abstraction which extend only to the conceive separately such object as it be possible may really exist or be actually perceive asunder but my conceive or imagine power do not extend beyond the possibility of real existence or perception hence as it be impossible for me to see or feel any thing without an actual sensation of that thing so be it impossible for me to conceive in my thoughts any sensible thing or object distinct from the sensation or perception of it some truths there be so near and obvious to the mind that a man need only open his eye to see them such i take this important one to be to wit that all the choir of heaven and furniture of the earth in a word all those body which compose the mighty frame of the world have not any subsistence without a mind that their be be to be perceive or know that consequently so long as they be not actually perceive by me or do not exist in my mind or that of any other create spirit they must either have no existence at all or else subsist in the mind of some eternal spirit it be perfectly unintelligible and involve all the absurdity of abstraction to attribute to any single part of them an existence independent of a spirit to be convince of which the reader need only reflect and try to separate in his own thoughts the be of a sensible thing from its be perceive from what have be say it follow there be not any other substance than spirit or that which perceive but for the fuller proof of this point let it be consider the sensible qualities be colour figure motion smell taste and such like that be the ideas perceive by sense now for an idea to exist in an unperceiving thing be a manifest contradiction for to have an idea be all one as to perceive that therefore wherein colour figure and the like qualities exist must perceive them hence it be clear there can be no unthinking substance or substratum of those ideas but say you though the ideas themselves do not exist without the mind yet there may be things like them whereof they be copy or resemblances which things exist without the mind in an unthinking substance i answer an idea can be like nothing but an idea a colour or figure can be like nothing but another colour or figure if we look but ever so little into our thoughts we shall find it impossible for us to conceive a liken except only between our ideas again i ask whether those suppose originals or external things of which our ideas be the picture or representations be themselves perceivable or no if they be then they be ideas and we have gain our point but if you say they be not i appeal to any one whether it be sense to assert a colour be like something which be invisible hard or soft like something which be intangible and so of the rest some there be who make a distinction betwixt primary and secondary qualities by the former they mean extension figure motion rest solidity or impenetrability and number by the latter they denote all other sensible qualities as colour sound taste and so forth the ideas we have of these they acknowledge not to be the resemblances of any thing exist without the mind or unperceived but they will have our ideas of the primary qualities to be pattern or image of things which exist without the mind in an unthinking substance which they call matter by matter therefore we be to understand an inert senseless substance in which extension figure and motion do actually subsist but it be evident from what we have already shew that extension figure and motion be only ideas exist in the mind and that an idea can be like nothing but another idea and that consequently neither they nor their archetypes can exist in an unperceiving substance hence it be plain that that the very notion of what be call matter or corporeal substance involve a contradiction in it they who assert that figure motion and the rest of the primary or original qualities do exist without the mind in unthinking substances do at the same time acknowledge that colour sound heat cold and suchlike secondary qualities do not which they tell us be sensations exist in the mind alone that depend on and be occasion by the different size texture and motion of the minute particles of matter this they take for an undoubted truth which they can demonstrate beyond all exception now if it be certain that those original qualities be inseparably unite with the other sensible qualities and not even in think capable of be abstract from them it plainly follow that they exist only in the mind but i desire any one to reflect and try whether he can by any abstraction of think conceive the extension and motion of a body without all other sensible qualities for my own part i see evidently that it be not in my power to frame an idea of a body extend and move but i must withal give it some colour or other sensible quality which be acknowledge to exist only in the mind in short extension figure and motion abstract from all other qualities be inconceivable where therefore the other sensible qualities be there must these be also to wit in the mind and no where else again great and small swift and slow be allow to exist no where without the mind be intirely relative and change as the frame or position of the organs of sense vary the extension therefore which exist without the mind be neither great nor small the motion neither swift nor slow that be they be nothing at all but say you they be extension in general and motion in general thus we see how much the tenet of extend moveable substances exist without the mind depend on that strange doctrine of abstract ideas and here i can not but remark how nearly the vague and indeterminate description of matter or corporeal substance which the modern philosophers be run into by their own principles resemble that antiquate and so much ridicule notion of materia prima to be meet with in aristotle and his followers without extension solidity can not be conceive since therefore it have be shew that extension exist not in an unthinking substance the same must also be true of solidity that number be intirely the creature of the mind even though the other qualities be allow to exist without will be evident to whoever consider that the same thing bear a different denomination of number as the mind view it with different respect thus the same extension be one or three or thirty six accord as the mind consider it with reference to a yard a foot or an inch number be so visibly relative and dependent on mens understand that it be strange to think how any one should give it an absolute existence without the mind we say one book one page one line all these be equally unite though some contain several of the others and in each instance it be plain the unite relate to some particular combination of ideas arbitrarily put together by the mind unity i know some will have to be a simple or uncompounded idea accompany all other ideas into the mind that i have any such idea answer the word unity i do not find and if i have methinks i could not miss find it on the contrary it should be the most familiar to my understand since it be say to accompany all other ideas and to be perceive by all the ways of sensation and reflexion to say no more it be an abstract idea i shall farther add that after the same manner as modern philosophers prove certain sensible qualities to have no existence in matter or without the mind the same thing may be likewise prove of all other sensible qualities whatsoever thus for instance it be say that heat and cold be affections only of the mind and not at all pattern of real be exist in the corporeal substances which excite them for that the same body which appear cold to one hand seem warm to another now why may we not as well argue that figure and extension be not pattern or resemblances of qualities exist in matter because to the same eye at different station or eye of a different texture at the same station they appear various and can not therefore be the image of any thing settle and determinate without the mind again it be prove that sweetness be not really in the sapid thing because the thing remain unaltered the sweetness be change into bitter as in case of a fever or otherwise vitiate palate be it not as reasonable to say that motion be not without the mind since if the succession of ideas in the mind become swifter the motion it be acknowledge shall appear slower without any alteration in any external object in short let any one consider those arguments which be think manifestly to prove that colour and taste exist only in the mind and he shall find they may with equal force be bring to prove the same thing of extension figure and motion though it must be confess this method of argue doth not so much prove that there be no extension or colour in an outward object as that we do not know by sense which be the true extension or colour of the object but the arguments forego plainly shew it to be impossible that any colour or extension at all or other sensible quality whatsoever should exist in an unthinking subject without the mind or in truth that there should be any such thing as an outward object but let us examine a little the receive opinion it be say extension be a mode or accident of matter and that matter be the substratum that support it now i desire that you would explain what be mean by matter support extension say you i have no idea of matter and therefore can not explain it i answer though you have no positive yet if you have any mean at all you must at least have a relative idea of matter though you know not what it be yet you must be suppose to know what relation it bear to accidents and what be mean by its support them it be evident support can not here be take in its usual or literal sense as when we say that pillars support a build in what sense therefore must it be take if we inquire into what the most accurate philosophers declare themselves to mean by material substance we shall find them acknowledge they have no other mean annex to those sound but the idea of be in general together with the relative notion of its support accidents the general idea of be appeareth to me the most abstract and incomprehensible of all other and as for its support accidents this as we have just now observe can not be understand in the common sense of those word it must therefore be take in some other sense but what that be they do not explain so that when i consider the two part or branch which make the signification of the word material substance i be convince there be no distinct mean annex to them but why should we trouble our selves any farther in discuss this material substratum or support of figure and motion and other sensible qualities do it not suppose they have an existence without the mind and be not this a direct repugnancy and altogether inconceivable but though it be possible that solid figure moveable substances may exist without the mind correspond to the ideas we have of body yet how be it possible for us to know this either we must know it by sense or by reason as for our sense by them we have the knowledge only of our sensations ideas or those things that be immediately perceive by sense call them what you will but they do not inform us that things exist without the mind or unperceived like to those which be perceive this the materialists themselves acknowledge it remain therefore that if we have any knowledge at all of external things it must be by reason infer their existence from what be immediately perceive by sense but what reason can induce us to believe the existence of body without the mind from what we perceive since the very patrons of matter themselves do not pretend there be any necessary connexion betwixt them and our ideas i say it be grant on all hand and what happen in dream phrensies and the like put it beyond dispute that it be possible we might be affect with all the ideas we have now though no body exist without resemble them hence it be evident the supposition of external body be not necessary for the produce our ideas since it be grant they be produce sometimes and might possibly be produce always in the same order we see them in at present without their concurrence but though we might possibly have all our sensations without them yet perhaps it may be think easier to conceive and explain the manner of their production by suppose external body in their liken rather than otherwise and so it might be at least probable there be such things as body that excite their ideas in our mind but neither can this be say for though we give the materialists their external body they by their own confession be never the nearer know how our ideas be produce since they own themselves unable to comprehend in what manner body can act upon spirit or how it be possible it should imprint any idea in the mind hence it be evident the production of ideas or sensations in our mind can be no reason why we should suppose matter or corporeal substances since that be acknowledge to remain equally inexplicable with or without this supposition if therefore it be possible for body to exist without the mind yet to hold they do so must need be a very precarious opinion since it be to suppose without any reason at all that god have create innumerable be that be intirely useless and serve to no manner of purpose in short if there be external body it be impossible we should ever come to know it and if there be not we might have the very same reason to think there be that we have now suppose what no one can deny possible an intelligence without the help of external body to be affect with the same train of sensations or ideas that you be imprint in the same order and with like vividness in his mind i ask whether that intelligence hath not all the reason to believe the existence of corporeal substances represent by his ideas and excite them in his mind that you can possibly have for believe the same thing of this there can be no question which one consideration be enough to make any reasonable person suspect the strength of whatever arguments be may think himself to have for the existence of body without the mind be it necessary to add any farther proof against the existence of matter after what have be say i could instance several of those errors and difficulties not to mention impieties which have spring from that tenet it have occasion numberless controversies and dispute in philosophy and not a few of far greater moment in religion but i shall not enter into the detail of them in this place as well because i think arguments a posteriori be unnecessary for confirm what have be if i mistake not sufficiently demonstrate a priori as because i shall hereafter find occasion to say somewhat of them i be afraid i have give cause to think me needlesly prolix in handle this subject for to what purpose be it to dilate on that which may be demonstrate with the utmost evidence in a line or two to any one that be capable of the least reflexion it be but look into your own thoughts and so try whether you can conceive it possible for a sound or figure or motion or colour to exist without the mind or unperceived this easy trial may make you see that what you contend for be a downright contradiction insomuch that i be content to put the whole upon this issue if you can but conceive it possible for one extend moveable substance or in general for any one idea or any thing like an idea to exist otherwise than in a mind perceive it i shall readily give up the cause and as for all that compages of external body which you contend for i shall grant you its existence though you can not either give me any reason why you believe it exist or assign any use to it when it be suppose to exist i say the bare possibility of your opinions be true shall pass for an argument that it be so but say you surely there be nothing easier than to imagine tree for instance in a park or book exist in a closet and no body by to perceive them i answer you may so there be no difficulty in it but what be all this i beseech you more than frame in your mind certain ideas which you call book and tree and the same time omit to frame the idea of any one that may perceive them but do not you your self perceive or think of them all the while this therefore be nothing to the purpose it only shew you have the power of imagine or form ideas in your mind but it doth not shew that you can conceive it possible the object of your think may exist without the mind to make out this it be necessary that you conceive them exist unconceived or unthought of which be a manifest repugnancy when we do our utmost to conceive the existence of external body we be all the while only contemplate our own ideas but the mind take no notice of it self be delude to think it can and doth conceive body exist unthought of or without the mind though at the same time they be apprehend by or exist in it self a little attention will discover to any one the truth and evidence of what be here say and make it unnecessary to insist on any other proof against the existence of material substance it be very obvious upon the least inquiry into our own thoughts to know whether it be possible for us to understand what be mean by the absolute existence of sensible object in themselves or without the mind to me it be evident those word mark out either a direct contradiction or else nothing at all and to convince others of this i know no readier or fairer way than to intreat they would calmly attend to their own thoughts and if by this attention the emptiness or repugnancy of those expressions do appear surely nothing more be requisite for their conviction it be on this therefore that i insist to wit that the absolute existence of unthinking things be word without a mean or which include a contradiction this be what i repeat and inculcate and earnestly recommend to the attentive thoughts of the reader all our ideas sensations or the things which we perceive by whatsoever name they may be distinguish be visibly inactive there be nothing of power or agency include in them so that one idea or object of think can not produce or make any alteration in another to be satisfy of the truth of this there be nothing else requisite but a bare observation of our ideas for since they and every part of them exist only in the mind it follow that there be nothing in them but what be perceive but whoever shall attend to his ideas whether of sense or reflexion will not perceive in them any power or activity there be therefore no such thing contain in them a little attention will discover to us that the very be of an idea imply passiveness and inertness in it insomuch that it be impossible for an idea to do any thing or strictly speak to be the cause of any thing neither can it be the resemblance or pattern of any active be as be evident from sect whence it plainly follow that extension figure and motion can not be the cause of our sensations to say therefore that these be the effect of power result from the configuration number motion and size of corpuscles must certainly be false we perceive a continual succession of ideas some be anew excite others be change or totally disappear there be therefore some cause of these ideas whereon they depend and which produce and change them that this cause can not be any quality or idea or combination of ideas be clear from the precede section it must therefore be a substance but it have be shew that there be no corporeal or material substance it remain therefore that the cause of ideas be an incorporeal active substance or spirit a spirit be one simple undivided active be as it perceive ideas it be call the understand and as it produce or otherwise operate about them it be call the will hence there can be no idea form of a soul or spirit for all ideas whatever be passive and inert vide sect they can not represent unto us by way of image or liken that which act a little attention will make it plain to any one that to have an idea which shall be like that active principle of motion and change of ideas be absolutely impossible such be the nature of spirit or that which act that it can not be of it self perceive but only by the effect which it produceth if any man shall doubt of the truth of what be here deliver let him but reflect and try if he can frame the idea of any power or active be and whether he hath ideas of two principal power mark by the name will and understand distinct from each other as well as from a third idea of substance or be in general with a relative notion of its support or be the subject of the aforesaid power which be signify by the name soul or spirit this be what some hold but so far as i can see the word will soul spirit do not stand for different ideas or in truth for any idea at all but for something which be very different from ideas and which be an agent can not be like unto or represent by any idea whatsoever though it must be own at the same time that we have some notion of soul spirit and the operations of the mind such as will love hat in as much as we know or understand the mean of those word i find i can excite ideas in my mind at pleasure and vary and shift the scene as oft as i think fit it be no more than will and straightway this or that idea arise in my fancy and by the same power it be obliterate and make way for another this make and unmake of ideas doth very properly denominate the mind active thus much be certain and ground on experience but when we think of unthinking agents or of excite ideas exclusive of volition we only amuse our selves with word but whatever power i may have over my own thoughts i find the ideas actually perceive by sense have not a like dependence on my will when in broad daylight i open my eye it be not in my power to choose whether i shall see or no or to determine what particular object shall present themselves to my view and so likewise as to the hear and other sense the ideas imprint on them be not creatures of my will there be therefore some other will or spirit that produce them the ideas of sense be more strong lively and distinct than those of the imagination they have likewise a steddiness order and coherence and be not excite at random as those which be the effect of humane will often be but in a regular train or series the admirable connexion whereof sufficiently testify the wisdom and benevolence of its author now the set rule or establish methods wherein the mind we depend on excite in us the ideas of sense be call the laws of nature and these we learn by experience which teach us that such and such ideas be attend with such and such other ideas in the ordinary course of things this give us a sort of foresight which enable us to regulate our action for the benefit of life and without this we should be eternally at a loss we could not know how to act any thing that might procure us the least pleasure or remove the least pain of sense that food nourish sleep refresh and fire warm us that to sow in the seedtime be the way to reap in the harvest and in general that to obtain such or such end such or such mean be conducive all this we know not by discover any necessary connexion between our ideas but only by the observation of the settle laws of nature without which we should be all in uncertainty and confusion and a grow man no more know how to manage himself in the affairs of life than an infant just bear and yet this consistent uniform work which so evidently display the goodness and wisdom of that govern spirit whose will constitute the laws of nature be so far from lead our thoughts to him that it rather send them a wander after second cause for when we perceive certain ideas of sense constantly follow by other ideas and we know this be not of our own do we forthwith attribute power and agency to the ideas themselves and make one the cause of another than which nothing can be more absurd and unintelligible thus for example have observe that when we perceive by sight a certain round luminous figure we at the same time perceive by touch the idea or sensation call heat we do from thence conclude the sun to be the cause of heat and in like manner perceive the motion and collision of body to be attend with sound we be incline to think the latter an effect of the former the ideas imprint on the sense by the author of nature be call real things and those excite in the imagination be less regular vivid and constant be more properly term ideas or image of things which they copy and represent but then our sensations be they never so vivid and distinct be nevertheless ideas that be they exist in the mind or be perceive by it as truly as the ideas of its own frame the ideas of sense be allow to have more reality in them that be to be more strong orderly and coherent than the creatures of the mind but this be no argument that they exist without the mind they be also less dependent on the spirit or think substance which perceive them in that they be excite by the will of another and more powerful spirit yet still they be ideas and certainly no idea whether faint or strong can exist otherwise than in a mind perceive it before we proceed any farther it be necessary to spend some time in answer objections which may probably be make against the principles hitherto lay down in do of which if i seem too prolix to those of quick apprehensions i hope it may be pardon since all men do not equally apprehend things of this nature and i be will to be understand by every one first then it will be object that by the forego principles all that be real and substantial in nature be banish out of the world and instead thereof a chimerical scheme of ideas take place all things that exist exist only in the mind that be they be purely notional what therefore become of the sun moon and star what must we think of house rivers mountains tree stone nay even of our own body be all these but so many chimeras and illusions on the fancy to all which and whatever else of the same sort may be object i answer that by the principles premise we be not deprive of any one thing in nature whatever we see feel hear or any wise conceive or understand remain as secure as ever and be as real as ever there be a rerum natura and the distinction between realities and chimeras retain its full force this be evident from sect and where we have shew what be mean by real things in opposition to chimeras or ideas of our own frame but then they both equally exist in the mind and in that sense they be alike ideas i do not argue against the existence of any one thing that we can apprehend either by sense or reflexion that the things i see with mine eye and touch with my hand do exist really exist i make not the least question the only thing whose existence we deny be that which philosophers call matter or corporeal substance and in do of this there be no damage do to the rest of mankind who i dare say will never miss it the atheist indeed will want the colour of an empty name to support his impiety and the philosophers may possibly find they have lose a great handle for trifle and disputation if any man think this detract from the existence or reality of things he be very far from understand what hath be premise in the plainest term i could think of take here an abstract of what have be say there be spiritual substances mind or humane souls which will or excite ideas in themselves at pleasure but these be faint weak and unsteady in respect of others they perceive by sense which be impress upon them accord to certain rule or laws of nature speak themselves the effect of a mind more powerful and wise than humane spirit these latter be say to have more reality in them than the former by which be mean that they be more affect orderly and distinct and that they be not fictions of the mind perceive them and in this sense the sun that i see by day be the real sun and that which i imagine by night be the idea of the former in the sense here give of reality it be evident that every vegetable star mineral and in general each part of the mundane system be as much a real be by our principles as by any other whether others mean any thing by the term reality different from what i do i intreat them to look into their own thoughts and see it will be urge that thus much at least be true to wit that we take away all corporeal substances to this my answer be that if the word substance be take in the vulgar sense for a combination of sensible qualities such as extension solidity weight and the like this we can not be accuse of take away but if it be take in a philosophic sense for the support of accidents or qualities without the mind then indeed i acknowledge that we take it away if one may be say to take away that which never have any existence not even in the imagination but say you it sound very harsh to say we eat and drink ideas and be clothe with ideas i acknowledge it do so the word idea not be use in common discourse to signify the several combinations of sensible qualities which be call things and it be certain that any expression which vary from the familiar use of language will seem harsh and ridiculous but this doth not concern the truth of the proposition which in other word be no more than to say we be feed and clothe with those things which we perceive immediately by our sense the hardness or softness the colour taste warmth figure and such like qualities which combine together constitute the several sort of victual and apparel have be shew to exist only in the mind that perceive them and this be all that be mean by call them ideas which word if it be as ordinarily use as thing would sound no harsher nor more ridiculous than it i be not for dispute about the propriety but the truth of the expression if therefore you agree with me that we eat and drink and be clothe with the immediate object of sense which can not exist unperceived or without the mind i shall readily grant it be more proper or conformable to custom that they should be call things rather than ideas if it be demand why i make use of the word idea and do not rather in compliance with custom call them things i answer i do it for two reason first because the term thing in contradistinction to idea be generally suppose to denote somewhat exist without the mind secondly because thing hath a more comprehensive signification than idea include spirit or think things as well as ideas since therefore the object of sense exist only in the mind and be withal thoughtless and inactive i choose to mark them by the word idea which imply those properties but say what we can some one perhaps may be apt to reply he will still believe his sense and never suffer any arguments how plausible soever to prevail over the certainty of them be it so assert the evidence of sense as high as you please we be will to do the same that what i see hear and feel doth exist that be to say be perceive by me i no more doubt than i do of my own be but i do not see how the testimony of sense can be alledged as a proof for the existence of any thing which be not perceive by sense we be not for have any man turn sceptic and disbelieve his sense on the contrary we give them all the stress and assurance imaginable nor be there any principles more opposite to scepticism than those we have lay down as shall be hereafter clearly shew secondly it will be object that there be a great difference betwixt real fire for instance and the idea of fire betwixt dream or imagine ones self burn and actually be so this and the like may be urge in opposition to our tenets to all which the answer be evident from what hath be already say and i shall only add in this place that if real fire be very different from the idea of fire so also be the real pain that it occasion very different from the idea of the same pain and yet no body will pretend that real pain either be or can possibly be in an unperceiving thing or without the mind any more than its idea thirdly it will be object that we see things actually without or at distance from us and which consequently do not exist in the mind it be absurd that those things which be see at the distance of several miles should be as near to us as our own thoughts in answer to this i desire it may be consider that in a dream we do oft perceive things as exist at a great distance off and yet for all that those things be acknowledge to have their existence only in the mind but for the fuller clear of this point it may be worth while to consider how it be that we perceive distance and things place at a distance by sight for that we should in truth see external space and body actually exist in it some nearer others farther off seem to carry with it some opposition to what hath be say of their exist no where without the mind the consideration of this difficulty it be that give birth to my essay towards a new theory of vision which be publish not long since wherein it be shew that distance or outness be neither immediately of it self perceive by sight nor yet apprehend or judge of by line and angle or any thing that hath a necessary connexion with it but that it be only suggest to our thoughts by certain visible ideas and sensations attend vision which in their own nature have no manner of similitude or relation either with distance or things place at a distance but by a connexion teach us by experience they come to signify and suggest them to us after the same manner that word of any language suggest the ideas they be make to stand for insomuch that a man bear blind and afterwards make to see would not at first sight think the things he saw to be without his mind or at any distance from him see sect of the forementioned treatise the ideas of sight and touch make two species intirely distinct and heterogeneous the former be mark and prognostics of the latter that the proper object of sight neither exist without the mind nor be the image of external things be shew even in that treatise though throughout the same the contrary be suppose true of tangible object not that to suppose that vulgar error be necessary for establish the notion therein lay down but because it be beside my purpose to examine and refute it in a discourse concern vision so that in strict truth the ideas of sight when we apprehend by them distance and things place at a distance do not suggest or mark out to us things actually exist at a distance but only admonish us what ideas of touch will be imprint in our mind at such and such distance of time and in consequence of such or such action it be i say evident from what have be say in the forego part of this treatise and in sect and elsewhere of the essay concern vision that visible ideas be the language whereby the govern spirit on whom we depend inform us what tangible ideas he be about to imprint upon us in case we excite this or that motion in our own body but for a fuller information in this point i refer to the essay it self fourthly it will be object that from the forego principles it follow things be every moment annihilate and create anew the object of sense exist only when they be perceive the tree therefore be in the garden or the chair in the parlour no longer than while there be some body by to perceive them upon shut my eye all the furniture in the room be reduce to nothing and barely upon open them it be again create in answer to all which i refer the reader to what have be say in sect c and desire he will consider whether he mean any thing by the actual existence of an idea distinct from its be perceive for my part after the nicest inquiry i could make i be not able to discover that any thing else be mean by those word and i once more intreat the reader to sound his own thoughts and not suffer himself to be impose on by word if he can conceive it possible either for his ideas or their archetypes to exist without be perceive then i give up the cause but if he can not he will acknowledge it be unreasonable for him to stand up in defence of he know not what and pretend to charge on me as an absurdity the not assent to those proposition which at bottom have no mean in them it will not be amiss to observe how far the receive principles of philosophy be themselves chargeable with those pretend absurdities it be think strangely absurd that upon close my eyelids all the visible object round me should be reduce to nothing and yet be not this what philosophers commonly acknowledge when they agree on all hand that light and colour which alone be the proper and immediate object of sight be mere sensations that exist no longer than they be perceive again it may to some perhaps seem very incredible that things should be every moment create yet this very notion be commonly teach in the school for the schoolmen though they acknowledge the existence of matter and that the whole mundane fabrick be frame out of it be nevertheless of opinion that it can not subsist without the divine conservation which by them be expound to be a continual creation farther a little think will discover to us that though we allow the existence of matter or corporeal substance yet it will unavoidably follow from the principles which be now generally admit that the particular body of what kind soever do none of them exist whilst they be not perceive for it be evident from sect and the follow section that the matter philosophers contend for be an incomprehensible somewhat which hath none of those particular qualities whereby the body fall under our sense be distinguish one from another but to make this more plain it must be remark that the infinite divisibility of matter be now universally allow at least by the most approve and considerable philosophers who on the receive principles demonstrate it beyond all exception hence it follow that there be an infinite number of part in each particle of matter which be not perceive by sense the reason therefore that any particular body seem to be of a finite magnitude or exhibit only a finite number of part to sense be not because it contain no more since in itself it contain an infinite number of part but because the sense be not acute enough to discern them in proportion therefore as the sense be render more acute it perceive a greater number of part in the object that be the object appear greater and its figure vary those part in its extremities which be before unperceivable appear now to bind it in very different line and angle from those perceive by an obtuser sense and at length after various change of size and shape when the sense become infinitely acute the body shall seem infinite during all which there be no alteration in the body but only in the sense each body therefore consider in it self be infinitely extend and consequently void of all shape or figure from which it follow that though we should grant the existence of matter to be ever so certain yet it be withal as certain the materialists themselves be by their own principles force to acknowledge that neither the particular body perceive by sense nor any thing like them exist without the mind matter i say and each particle thereof be accord to them infinite and shapeless and it be the mind that frame all that variety of body which compose the visible world any one whereof do not exist longer than it be perceive if we consider it the objection propose in sect will not be find reasonably charge on the principles we have premise so as in truth to make any objection at all against our notions for though we hold indeed the object of sense to be nothing else but ideas which can not exist unperceived yet we may not hence conclude they have no existence except only while they be perceive by us since there may be some other spirit that perceive them though we do not wherever body be say to have no existence without the mind i would not be understand to mean this or that particular mind but all mind whatsoever it do not therefore follow from the forego principles that body be annihilate and create every moment or exist not at all during the intervals between our perception of them fifthly it may perhaps be object that if extension and figure exist only in the mind it follow that the mind be extend and figure since extension be a mode or attribute which to speak with the school be predicate of the subject in which it exist i answer those qualities be in the mind only as they be perceive by it that be not by way of mode or attribute but only by way of idea and it no more follow that the soul or mind be extend because extension exist in it alone than it do that it be red or blue because those colour be on all hand acknowledge to exist in it and no where else as to what philosophers say of subject and mode that seem very groundless and unintelligible for instance in this proposition a die be hard extend and square they will have it that the word die denote a subject or substance distinct from the hardness extension and figure which be predicate of it and in which they exist this i can not comprehend to me a die seem to be nothing distinct from those things which be term its modes or accidents and to say a die be hard extend and square be not to attribute those qualities to a subject distinct from and support them but only an explication of the mean of the word die sixthly you will say there have be a great many things explain by matter and motion take away these and you destroy the whole corpuscular philosophy and undermine those mechanical principles which have be apply with so much success to account for the phænomena in short whatever advance have be make either by ancient or modern philosophers in the study of nature do all proceed on the supposition that corporeal substance or matter doth really exist to this i answer that there be not any one phænomenon explain on that supposition which may not as well be explain without it as might easily be make appear by an induction of particulars to explain the phænomena be all one as to shew why upon such and such occasion we be affect with such and such ideas but how matter should operate on a spirit or produce any idea in it be what no philosopher will pretend to explain it be therefore evident there can be no use of matter in natural philosophy besides they who attempt to account for things do it not by corporeal substance but by figure motion and other qualities which be in truth no more than mere ideas and therefore can not be the cause of any thing as hath be already shew see sect seventhly it will upon this be demand whether it do not seem absurd to take away natural cause and ascribe every thing to the immediate operation of spirit we must no longer say upon these principles that fire heat or water cool but that a spirit heat and so forth would not a man be deservedly laught at who should talk after this manner i answer he would so in such things we ought to think with the learn and speak with the vulgar they who to demonstration be convince of the truth of the copernican system do nevertheless say the sun rise the sun set or come to the meridian and if they affect a contrary stile in common talk it would without doubt appear very ridiculous a little reflexion on what be here say will make it manifest that the common use of language would receive no manner of alteration or disturbance from the admission of our tenets in the ordinary affairs of life any phrase may be retain so long as they excite in us proper sentiments or dispositions to act in such a manner as be necessary for our wellbeing how false soever they may be if take in a strict and speculative sense nay this be unavoidable since propriety be regulate by custom language be suit to the receive opinions which be not always the truest hence it be impossible even in the most rigid philosophic reason so far to alter the bend and genius of the tongue we speak as never to give a handle for cavillers to pretend difficulties and inconsistencies but a fair and ingenuous reader will collect the sense from the scope and tenor and connexion of a discourse make allowance for those inaccurate modes of speech which use have make inevitable as to the opinion that there be no corporeal cause this have be heretofore maintain by some of the schoolmen as it be of late by others among the modern philosophers who though they allow matter to exist yet will have god alone to be the immediate efficient cause of all things these men saw that amongst all the object of sense there be none which have any power or activity include in it and that by consequence this be likewise true of whatever body they suppose to exist without the mind like unto the immediate object of sense but then that they should suppose an innumerable multitude of create be which they acknowledge be not capable of produce any one effect in nature and which therefore be make to no manner of purpose since god might have do every thing as well without them this i say though we should allow it possible must yet be a very unaccountable and extravagant supposition in the eighth place the universal concurrent assent of mankind may be think by some an invincible argument in behalf of matter or the existence of external things must we suppose the whole world to be mistake and if so what cause can be assign of so widespread and predominant an error i answer first that upon a narrow inquiry it will not perhaps be find so many as be imagine do really believe the existence of matter or things without the mind strictly speak to believe that which involve a contradiction or have no mean in it be impossible and whether the forego expressions be not of that sort i refer it to the impartial examination of the reader in one sense indeed men may be say to believe that matter exist that be they act as if the immediate cause of their sensations which affect them every moment and be so nearly present to them be some senseless unthinking be but that they should clearly apprehend any mean mark by those word and form thereof a settle speculative opinion be what i be not able to conceive this be not the only instance wherein men impose upon themselves by imagine they believe those proposition they have often hear though at bottom they have no mean in them but secondly though we should grant a notion to be ever so universally and stedfastly adhere to yet this be but a weak argument of its truth to whoever consider what a vast number of prejudice and false opinions be every where embrace with the utmost tenaciousness by the unreflecting which be the far greater part of mankind there be a time when the antipodes and motion of the earth be look upon as monstrous absurdities even by men of learn and if it be consider what a small proportion they bear to the rest of mankind we shall find that at this day those notions have gain but a very inconsiderable foot in the world but it be demand that we assign a cause of this prejudice and account for its obtain in the world to this i answer that men know they perceive several ideas whereof they themselves be not the author as not be excite from within nor depend on the operation of their will this make them maintain those ideas or object of perception have an existence independent of and without the mind without ever dream that a contradiction be involve in those word but philosophers have plainly see that the immediate object of perception do not exist without the mind they in some degree correct the mistake of the vulgar but at the same time run into another which seem no less absurd to wit that there be certain object really exist without the mind or have a subsistence distinct from be perceive of which our ideas be only image or resemblances imprint by those object on the mind and this notion of the philosophers owe its origin to the same cause with the former namely their be conscious that they be not the author of their own sensations which they evidently know be imprint from without and which therefore must have some cause distinct from the mind on which they be imprint but why they should suppose the ideas of sense to be excite in us by things in their liken and not rather have recourse to spirit which alone can act may be account for first because they be not aware of the repugnancy there be as well in suppose things like unto our ideas exist without as in attribute to them power or activity secondly because the supreme spirit which excite those ideas in our mind be not mark out and limit to our view by any particular finite collection of sensible ideas as humane agents be by their size complexion limbs and motion and thirdly because his operations be regular and uniform whenever the course of nature be interrupt by a miracle men be ready to own the presence of a superior agent but when we see things go on in the ordinary course they do not excite in us any reflexion their order and concatenation though it be an argument of the greatest wisdom power and goodness in their creator be yet so constant and familiar to us that we do not think them the immediate effect of a free spirit especially since inconstancy and mutability in act though it be an imperfection be look on as a mark of freedom tenthly it will be object that the notions we advance be inconsistent with several sound truths in philosophy and mathematicks for example the motion of the earth be now universally admit by astronomers as a truth ground on the clearest and most convince reason but on the forego principles there can be no such thing for motion be only an idea it follow that if it be not perceive it exist not but the motion of the earth be not perceive by sense i answer that tenet if rightly understand will be find to agree with the principles we have premise for the question whether the earth move or no amount in reality to no more than this to wit whether we have reason to conclude from what hath be observe by astronomers that if we be place in such and such circumstances and such or such a position and distance both from the earth and sun we should perceive the former to move among the choir of the planets and appear in all respect like one of them and this by the establish rule of nature which we have no reason to mistrust be reasonably collect from the phænomena we may from the experience we have have of the train and succession of ideas in our mind often make i will not say uncertain conjecture but sure and wellgrounded predictions concern the ideas we shall be affect with pursuant to a great train of action and be enable to pass a right judgment of what would have appear to us in case we be place in circumstances very different from those we be in at present herein consist the knowledge of nature which may preserve its use and certainty very consistently with what hath be say it will be easy to apply this to whatever objections of the like sort may be draw from the magnitude of the star or any other discoveries in astronomy or nature in the eleventh place it will be demand to what purpose serve that curious organization of plant and the admirable mechanism in the part of animals might not vegetables grow and shoot forth leave and blossom and animals perform all their motion as well without as with all that variety of internal part so elegantly contrive and put together which be ideas have nothing powerful or operative in them nor have any necessary connexion with the effect ascribe to them if it be a spirit that immediately produce every effect by a fiat or act of his will we must think all that be fine and artificial in the work whether of man or nature to be make in vain by this doctrine though an artist hath make the spring and wheel and every movement of a watch and adjust them in such a manner as he know would produce the motion he design yet he must think all this do to no purpose and that it be an intelligence which direct the index and point to the hour of the day if so why may not the intelligence do it without his be at the pain of make the movements and put them together why do not an empty case serve as well as another and how come it to pass that whenever there be any fault in the go of a watch there be some correspond disorder to be find in the movements which be mend by a skilful hand all be right again the like may be say of all the clockwork of nature great part whereof be so wonderfully fine and subtile as scarce to be discern by the best microscope in short it will be ask how upon our principles any tolerable account can be give or any final cause assign of an innumerable multitude of body and machine frame with the most exquisite art which in the common philosophy have very apposite use assign them and serve to explain abundance of phænomena to all which i answer first that though there be some difficulties relate to the administration of providence and the use by it assign to the several part of nature which i could not solve by the forego principles yet this objection could be of small weight against the truth and certainty of those things which may be prove a priori with the utmost evidence secondly but neither be the receive principles free from the like difficulties for it may still be demand to what end god should take those roundabout methods of effect things by instrument and machine which no one can deny might have be effect by the mere command of his will without all that apparatus nay if we narrowly consider it we shall find the objection may be retort with greater force on those who hold the existence of those machine without the mind for it have be make evident that solidity bulk figure motion and the like have no activity or efficacy in them so as to be capable of produce any one effect in nature see sect whoever therefore suppose them to exist allow the supposition possible when they be not perceive do it manifestly to no purpose since the only use that be assign to them as they exist unperceived be that they produce those perceivable effect which in truth can not be ascribe to any thing but spirit but to come nearer the difficulty it must be observe that though the fabrication of all those part and organs be not absolutely necessary to the produce any effect yet it be necessary to the produce of things in a constant regular way accord to the laws of nature there be certain general laws that run through the whole chain of natural effect these be learn by the observation and study of nature and be by men apply as well to the frame artificial things for the use and ornament of life as to the explain the various phænomena which explication consist only in shew the conformity any particular phænomenon hath to the general laws of nature or which be the same thing in discover the uniformity there be in the production of natural effect as will be evident to whoever shall attend to the several instance wherein philosophers pretend to account for appearances that there be a great and conspicuous use in these regular constant methods of work observe by the supreme agent hath be shew in sect and it be no less visible that a particular size figure motion and disposition of part be necessary though not absolutely to the produce any effect yet to the produce it accord to the stand mechanical laws of nature thus for instance it can not be deny that god or the intelligence which sustain and rule the ordinary course of things might if he be mind to produce a miracle cause all the motion on the dialplate of a watch though no body have ever make the movements and put them in it but yet if he will act agreeably to the rule of mechanism by him for wise end establish and maintain in the creation it be necessary that those action of the watchmaker whereby he make the movements and rightly adjust them precede the production of the aforesaid motion as also that any disorder in them be attend with the perception of some correspond disorder in the movements which be once correct all be right again it may indeed on some occasion be necessary that the author of nature display his overrule power in produce some appearance out of the ordinary series of things such exceptions from the general rule of nature be proper to surprise and awe men into an acknowledgment of the divine be but then they be to be use but seldom otherwise there be a plain reason why they should fail of that effect besides god seem to choose the convince our reason of his attribute by the work of nature which discover so much harmony and contrivance in their make and be such plain indications of wisdom and beneficence in their author rather than to astonish us into a belief of his be by anomalous and surprise events to set this matter in a yet clearer light i shall observe that what have be object in sect amount in reality to no more than this ideas be not any how and at random produce there be a certain order and connexion between them like to that of cause and effect there be also several combinations of them make in a very regular and artificial manner which seem like so many instrument in the hand of nature that be hide as it be behind the scenes have a secret operation in produce those appearances which be see on the theatre of the world be themselves discernible only to the curious eye of the philosopher but since one idea can not be the cause of another to what purpose be that connexion and since those instrument be barely inefficacious perceptions in the mind be not subservient to the production of natural effect it be demand why they be make or in other word what reason can be assign why god should make us upon a close inspection into his work behold so great variety of ideas so artfully lay together and so much accord to rule it not be credible that he would be at the expense if one may so speak of all that art and regularity to no purpose to all which my answer be first that the connexion of ideas do not imply the relation of cause and effect but only of a mark or sign with the thing signify the fire which i see be not the cause of the pain i suffer upon my approach it but the mark that forewarn me of it in like manner the noise that i hear be not the effect of this or that motion or collision of the ambient body but the sign thereof secondly the reason why ideas be form into machine that be artificial and regular combinations be the same with that for combine letter into word that a few original ideas may be make to signify a great number of effect and action it be necessary they be variously combine together and to the end their use be permanent and universal these combinations must be make by rule and with wise contrivance by this mean abundance of information be convey unto us concern what we be to expect from such and such action and what methods be proper to be take for the excite such and such ideas which in effect be all that i conceive to be distinctly mean when it be say that by discern the figure texture and mechanism of the inward part of body whether natural or artificial we may attain to know the several use and properties depend thereon or the nature of the thing hence it be evident that those things which under the notion of a cause cooperate or concur to the production of effect be altogether inexplicable and run us into great absurdities may be very naturally explain and have a proper and obvious use assign them when they be consider only as mark or sign for our information and it be the search after and endeavour to understand those sign institute by the author of nature that ought to be the employment of the natural philosopher and not the pretend to explain things by corporeal cause which doctrine seem to have too much estrange the mind of men from that active principle that supreme and wise spirit in whom we live move and have our be in the twelfth place it may perhaps be object that though it be clear from what have be say that there can be no such thing as an inert senseless extend solid figure moveable substance exist without the mind such as philosophers describe matter yet if any man shall leave out of his idea of matter the positive ideas of extension figure solidity and motion and say that he mean only by that word an inert senseless substance that exist without the mind or unperceived which be the occasion of our ideas or at the presence whereof god be please to excite ideas in us it doth not appear but that matter take in this sense may possibly exist in answer to which i say first that it seem no less absurd to suppose a substance without accidents than it be to suppose accidents without a substance but secondly though we should grant this unknown substance may possibly exist yet where can it be suppose to be that it exist not in the mind be agree and that it exist not in place be no less certain since all extension exist only in the mind as hath be already prove it remain therefore that it exist no where at all let us examine a little the description that be here give us of matter it neither act nor perceive nor be perceive for this be all that be mean by say it be an inert senseless unknown substance which be a definition intirely make up of negative except only the relative notion of its stand under or support but then it must be observe that it support nothing at all and how nearly this come to the description of a nonentity i desire may be consider but say you it be the unknown occasion at the presence of which ideas be excite in us by the will of god now i would fain know how any thing can be present to us which be neither perceivable by sense nor reflexion nor capable of produce any idea in our mind nor be at all extend nor hath any form nor exist in any place the word to be present when thus apply must need be take in some abstract and strange mean and which i be not able to comprehend again let us examine what be mean by occasion so far as i can gather from the common use of language that word signify either the agent which produce any effect or else something that be observe to accompany or go before it in the ordinary course of things but when it be apply to matter as above describe it can be take in neither of those sense for matter be say to be passive and inert and so can not be an agent or efficient cause it be also unperceivable as be devoid of all sensible qualities and so can not be the occasion of our perceptions in the latter sense as when the burn my finger be say to be the occasion of the pain that attend it what therefore can be mean by call matter an occasion this term be either use in no sense at all or else in some sense very distant from its receive signification you will perhaps say that matter though it be not perceive by us be nevertheless perceive by god to whom it be the occasion of excite ideas in our mind for say you since we observe our sensations to be imprint in an orderly and constant manner it be but reasonable to suppose there be certain constant and regular occasion of their be produce that be to say that there be certain permanent and distinct parcel of matter correspond to our ideas which though they do not excite them in our mind or any ways immediately affect us as be altogether passive and unperceivable to us they be nevertheless to god by whom they be perceive as it be so many occasion to remind him when and what ideas to imprint on our mind that so things may go on in a constant uniform manner in answer to this i observe that as the notion of matter be here state the question be no longer concern the existence of a thing distinct from spirit and idea from perceive and be perceive but whether there be not certain ideas of i know not what sort in the mind of god which be so many mark or note that direct him how to produce sensations in our mind in a constant and regular method much after the same manner as a musician be direct by the note of musick to produce that harmonious train and composition of sound which be call a tune though they who hear the musick do not perceive the note and may be intirely ignorant of them but this notion of matter seem too extravagant to deserve a confutation besides it be in effect no objection against what we have advance to wit that there be no senseless unperceived substance if we follow the light of reason we shall from the constant uniform method of our sensations collect the goodness and wisdom of the spirit who excite them in our mind but this be all that i can see reasonably conclude from thence to me i say it be evident that the be of a spirit infinitely wise good and powerful be abundantly sufficient to explain all the appearances of nature but as for inert senseless matter nothing that i perceive have any the least connexion with it or lead to the thoughts of it and i would fain see any one explain any the meanest phænomenon in nature by it or shew any manner of reason though in the lowest rank of probability that he can have for its existence or even make any tolerable sense or mean of that supposition for as to its be an occasion we have i think evidently shew that with regard to us it be no occasion it remain therefore that it must be if at all the occasion to god of excite ideas in us and what this amount to we have just now see it be worth while to reflect a little on the motives which induce men to suppose the existence of material substance that so have observe the gradual cease and expiration of those motives or reason we may proportionably withdraw the assent that be ground on them first therefore it be think that colour figure motion and the rest of the sensible qualities or accidents do really exist without the mind and for this reason it seem needful to suppose some unthinking substratum or substance wherein they do exist since they could not be conceive to exist by themselves afterwards in process of time men be convince that colour sound and the rest of the sensible secondary qualities have no existence without the mind they strip this substratum or material substance of those qualities leave only the primary ones figure motion and such like which they still conceive to exist without the mind and consequently to stand in need of a material support but it have be shew that none even of these can possibly exist otherwise than in a spirit or mind which perceive them it follow that we have no longer any reason to suppose the be of matter nay that it be utterly impossible there should be any such thing so long as that word be take to denote an unthinking substratum of qualities or accidents wherein they exist without the mind but though it be allow by the materialists themselves that matter be think of only for the sake of support accidents and the reason intirely cease one might expect the mind should naturally and without any reluctance at all quit the belief of what be solely ground thereon yet the prejudice be rivet so deeply in our thoughts that we can scarce tell how to part with it and be therefore incline since the thing it self be indefensible at least to retain the name which we apply to i know not what abstract and indefinite notions of be or occasion though without any shew of reason at least so far as i can see for what be there on our part or what do we perceive amongst all the ideas sensations notions which be imprint on our mind either by sense or reflexion from whence may be infer the existence of an inert thoughtless unperceived occasion and on the other hand on the part of an allsufficient spirit what can there be that should make us believe or even suspect he be direct by an inert occasion to excite ideas in our mind it be a very extraordinary instance of the force of prejudice and much to be lament that the mind of man retain so great a fondness against all the evidence of reason for a stupid thoughtless somewhat by the interposition whereof it would as it be skreen it self from the providence of god and remove him farther off from the affairs of the world but though we do the utmost we can to secure the belief of matter though when reason forsake us we endeavour to support our opinion on the bare possibility of the thing and though we indulge our selves in the full scope of an imagination not regulate by reason to make out that poor possibility yet the upshot of all be that there be certain unknown ideas in the mind of god for this if any thing be all that i conceive to be mean by occasion with regard to god and this at the bottom be no longer contend for the thing but for the name whether therefore there be such ideas in the mind of god and whether they may be call by the name matter i shall not dispute but if you stick to the notion of an unthinking substance or support of extension motion and other sensible qualities then to me it be most evidently impossible there should be any such thing since it be a plain repugnancy that those qualities should exist in or be support by an unperceiving substance but say you though it be grant that there be no thoughtless support of extension and the other qualities or accidents which we perceive yet there may perhaps be some inert unperceiving substance or substratum of some other qualities as incomprehensible to us as colour be to a man bear blind because we have not a sense adapt to them but if we have a new sense we should possibly no more doubt of their existence than a blindman make to see do of the existence of light and colour i answer first if what you mean by the word matter be only the unknown support of unknown qualities it be no matter whether there be such a thing or no since it no way concern us and i do not see the advantage there be in dispute about what we know not what and we know not why but secondly if we have a new sense it could only furnish us with new ideas or sensations and then we should have the same reason against their exist in an unperceiving substance that have be already offer with relation to figure motion colour and the like qualities as hath be shew be nothing else but sensations or ideas which exist only in a mind perceive them and this be true not only of the ideas we be acquaint with at present but likewise of all possible ideas whatsoever but you will insist what if i have no reason to believe the existence of matter what if i can not assign any use to it or explain any thing by it or even conceive what be mean by that word yet still it be no contradiction to say that matter exist and that this matter be in general a substance or occasion of ideas though indeed to go about to unfold the mean or adhere to any particular explication of those word may be attend with great difficulties i answer when word be use without a mean you may put them together as you please without danger of run into a contradiction you may say for example that twice two be equal to seven so long as you declare you do not take the word of that proposition in their usual acceptation but for mark of you know not what and by the same reason you may say there be an inert thoughtless substance without accidents which be the occasion of our ideas and we shall understand just as much by one proposition as the other in the last place you will say what if we give up the cause of material substance and assert that matter be an unknown somewhat neither substance nor accident spirit nor idea inert thoughtless indivisible immoveable unextended exist in no place for say you whatever may be urge against substance or occasion or any other positive or relative notion of matter hath no place at all so long as this negative definition of matter be adhere to i answer you may if so it shall seem good use the word matter in the same sense that other men use nothing and so make those term convertible in your style for after all this be what appear to me to be the result of that definition the part whereof when i consider with attention either collectively or separate from each other i do not find that there be any kind of effect or impression make on my mind different from what be excite by the term nothing you will reply perhaps that in the foresaid definition be include what doth sufficiently distinguish it from nothing the positive abstract idea of quiddity entity or existence i own indeed that those who pretend to the faculty of frame abstract general ideas do talk as if they have such an idea which be say they the most abstract and general notion of all that be to me the most incomprehensible of all others that there be a great variety of spirit of different order and capacities whose faculties both in number and extent be far exceed those the author of my be have bestow on me i see no reason to deny and for me to pretend to determine by my own few stint narrow inlets of perception what ideas the inexhaustible power of the supreme spirit may imprint upon them be certainly the utmost folly and presumption since there may be for ought that i know innumerable sort of ideas or sensations as different from one another and from all that i have perceive as colour be from sound but how ready soever i may be to acknowledge the scantiness of my comprehension with regard to the endless variety of spirit and ideas that might possibly exist yet for any one to pretend to a notion of entity or existence abstract from spirit and idea from perceive and be perceive be i suspect a downright repugnancy and trifle with word it remain that we consider the objections which may possibly be make on the part of religion some there be who think that though the arguments for the real existence of body which be draw from reason be allow not to amount to demonstration yet the holy scriptures be so clear in the point as will sufficiently convince every good christian that body do really exist and be something more than mere ideas there be in holy writ innumerable facts relate which evidently suppose the reality of timber and stone mountains and rivers and cities and humane body to which i answer that no sort of write whatever sacred or profane which use those and the like word in the vulgar acceptation or so as to have a mean in them be in danger of have their truth call in question by our doctrine that all those things do really exist that there be body even corporeal substances when take in the vulgar sense have be shew to be agreeable to our principles and the difference betwixt things and ideas realities and chimeras have be distinctly explain and i do not think that either what philosophers call matter or the existence of object without the mind be any where mention in scripture again whether there be or be not external things it be agree on all hand that the proper use of word be the mark our conceptions or things only as they be know and perceive by us whence it plainly follow that in the tenets we have lay down there be nothing inconsistent with the right use and significancy of language and that discourse of what kind soever so far as it be intelligible remain undisturbed but all this seem so manifest from what hath be set forth in the premise that it be needle to insist any farther on it but it will be urge that miracles do at least lose much of their stress and import by our principles what must we think of mosess rod be it not really turn into a serpent or be there only a change of ideas in the mind of the spectators and can it be suppose that our saviour do no more at the marriagefeast in cana than impose on the sight and smell and taste of the guests so as to create in them the appearance or idea only of wine the same may be say of all other miracles which in consequence of the forego principles must be look upon only as so many cheat or illusions of fancy to this i reply that the rod be change into a real serpent and the water into real wine that this doth not in the least contradict what i have elsewhere say will be evident from sect and but this business of real and imaginary hath be already so plainly and fully explain and so often refer to and the difficulties about it be so easily answer from what hath go before that it be an affront to the readers understand to resume the explication of it in this place i shall only observe that if at table all who be present should see and smell and taste and drink wine and find the effect of it with me there could be no doubt of its reality so that at bottom the scruple concern real miracles hath no place at all on ours but only on the receive principles and consequently maketh rather for than against what hath be say have do with the objections which i endeavour to propose in the clearest light and give them all the force and weight i could we proceed in the next place to take a view of our tenets in their consequences some of these appear at first sight as that several difficult and obscure question on which abundance of speculation hath be throw away be intirely banish from philosophy whether corporeal substance can think whether sect xxix xxx xxxiii xxxvi c matter be infinitely divisible and how it operate on spirit these and like inquiries have give infinite amusement to philosophers in all age but depend on the existence of matter they have no longer any place on our principles many other advantage there be as well with regard to religion as the sciences which it be easy for any one to deduce from what hath be premise but this will appear more plainly in the sequel from the principles we have lay down it follow humane knowledge may naturally be reduce to two head that of ideas and that of spirit of each of these i shall treat in order and first as to ideas or unthinking things our knowledge of these hath be very much obscure and confound and we have be lead into very dangerous errors by suppose a twofold existence of the object of sense the one intelligible or in the mind the other real and without the mind whereby unthinking things be think to have a natural subsistence of their own distinct from be perceive by spirit this which if i mistake not hath be shew to be a most groundless and absurd notion be the very root of scepticism for so long as men think that real things subsist without the mind and that their knowledge be only so far forth real as it be conformable to real things it follow they could not be certain they have any real knowledge at all for how can it be know that the things which be perceive be conformable to those which be not perceive or exist without the mind colour figure motion extension and the like consider only as so many sensations in the mind be perfectly know there be nothing in them which be not perceive but if they be look on as note or image refer to things or archetypes exist without the mind then be we involve all in scepticism we see only the appearances and not the real qualities of things what may be the extension figure or motion of any thing really and absolutely or in it self it be impossible for us to know but only the proportion or the relation they bear to our sense things remain the same our ideas vary and which of them or even whether any of them at all represent the true quality really exist in the thing it be out of our reach to determine so that for ought we know all we see hear and feel may be only phantom and vain chimera and not at all agree with the real things exist in rerum natura all this scepticism follow from our suppose a difference between things and ideas and that the former have a subsistence without the mind or unperceived it be easy to dilate on this subject and shew how the arguments urge by sceptics in all age depend on the supposition of external object so long as we attribute a real existence to unthinking things distinct from their be perceive it be not only impossible for us to know with evidence the nature of any real unthinking be but even that it exist hence it be that we see philosophers distrust their sense and doubt of the existence of heaven and earth of every thing they see or feel even of their own body and after all their labour and struggle of think they be force to own we can not attain to any selfevident or demonstrative knowledge of the existence of sensible things but all this doubtfulness which so bewilder and confound the mind and make philosophy ridiculous in the eye of the world vanish if we annex a mean to our word and do not amuse our selves with the term absolute external exist and such like signify we know not what i can as well doubt of my own be as of the be of those things which i actually perceive by sense it be a manifest contradiction that any sensible object should be immediately perceive by sight or touch and at the same time have no existence in nature since the very existence of an unthinking be consist in be perceive nothing seem of more importance towards erect a firm systeme of sound and real knowledge which may be proof against the assault of scepticism than to lay the begin in a distinct explication of what be mean by thing reality existence for in vain shall we dispute concern the real existence of things or pretend to any knowledge thereof so long as we have not fix the mean of those word thing or be be the most general name of all it comprehend under it two kinds intirely distinct and heterogeneous and which have nothing common but the name to wit spirit and ideas the former be active indivisible substances the latter be inert fleet dependent be which subsist not by themselves but be support by or exist in mind or spiritual substances we comprehend our own existence by inward feel or reflexion and that of other spirit by reason we may be say to have some knowledge or notion of our own mind of spirit and active be whereof in a strict sense we have not ideas in like manner we know and have a notion of relations between things or ideas which relations be distinct from the ideas or things relate inasmuch as the latter may be perceive by us without our perceive the former to me it seem that ideas spirit and relations be all in their respective kinds the object of humane knowledge and subject of discourse and that the term idea would be improperly extend to signify every thing we know or have any notion of ideas imprint on the sense be real things or do really exist this we do not deny but we deny they can subsist without the mind which perceive them or that they be resemblances of any archetypes exist without the mind since the very be of a sensation or idea consist in be perceive and an idea can be like nothing but an idea again the things perceive by sense may be term external with regard to their origin in that they be not generate from within by the mind it self but imprint by a spirit distinct from that which perceive them sensible object may likewise be say to be without the mind in another sense namely when they exist in some other mind thus when i shut my eye the things i saw may still exist but it must be in another mind it be a mistake to think that what be here say derogate in the least from the reality of things it be acknowledge on the receive principles that extension motion and in a word all sensible qualities have need of a support as not be able to subsist by themselves but the object perceive by sense be allow to be nothing but combinations of those qualities and consequently can not subsist by themselves thus far it be agree on all hand so that in deny the things perceive by sense an existence independent of a substance or support wherein they may exist we detract nothing from the receive opinion of their reality and be guilty of no innovation in that respect all the difference be that accord to us the unthinking be perceive by sense have no existence distinct from be perceive and can not therefore exist in any other substance than those unextended indivisible substances or spirit which act and think and perceive them whereas philosophers vulgarly hold that the sensible qualities exist in an inert extend unperceiving substance which they call matter to which they attribute a natural subsistence exterior to all think be or distinct from be perceive by any mind whatsoever even the eternal mind of the creator wherein they suppose only ideas of the corporeal substances create by him if indeed they allow them to be at all create for as we have shew the doctrine of matter or corporeal substance to have be the main pillar and support of scepticism so likewise upon the same foundation have be raise all the impious scheme of atheism and irreligion nay so great a difficulty hath it be think to conceive matter produce out of nothing that the most celebrate among the ancient philosophers even of these who maintain the be of a god have think matter to be uncreated and coeternal with him how great a friend material substance hath be to atheists in all age be needle to relate all their monstrous systems have so visible and necessary a dependence on it that when this cornerstone be once remove the whole fabrick can not choose but fall to the grind insomuch that it be no longer worth while to bestow a particular consideration on the absurdities of every wretched sect of atheists that impious and profane persons should readily fall in with those systems which favour their inclinations by deride immaterial substance and suppose the soul to be divisible and subject to corruption as the body which exclude all freedom intelligence and design from the formation of things and instead thereof make a selfexistent stupid unthinking substance the root and origin of all be that they should hearken to those who deny a providence or inspection of a superior mind over the affairs of the world attribute the whole series of events either to blind chance or fatal necessity arise from the impulse of one body on another all this be very natural and on the other hand when men of better principles observe the enemies of religion lay so great a stress on unthinking matter and all of them use so much industry and artifice to reduce every thing to it methinks they should rejoice to see them deprive of their grand support and drive from that only fortress without which your epicureans hobbists and the like have not even the shadow of a pretence but become the most cheap and easy triumph in the world the existence of matter or body unperceived have not only be the main support of atheists and fatalists but on the same principle doth idolatry likewise in all its various form depend do men but consider that the sun moon and star and every other object of the sense be only so many sensations in their mind which have no other existence but barely be perceive doubtless they would never fall down and worship their own ideas but rather address their homage to that eternal invisible mind which produce and sustain all things the same absurd principle by mingle it self with the article of our faith hath occasion no small difficulties to christians for example about the resurrection how many scruple and objections have be raise by socinians and others but do not the most plausible of them depend on the supposition that a body be denominate the same with regard not to the form or that which be perceive by sense but the material substance which remain the same under several form take away this material substance about the identity whereof all the dispute be and mean by body what every plain ordinary person mean by that word to wit that which be immediately see and felt which be only a combination of sensible qualities or ideas and then their most unanswerable objections come to nothing matter be once expel out of nature drag with it so many sceptical and impious notions such an incredible number of dispute and puzling question which have be thorns in the side of divine as well as philosophers and make so much fruitless work for mankind that if the arguments we have produce against it be not find equal to demonstration as to me they evidently seem yet i be sure all friends to knowledge peace and religion have reason to wish they be beside the external existence of the object of perception another great source of errors and difficulties with regard to ideal knowledge be the doctrine of abstract ideas such as it hath be set forth in the introduction the plainest things in the world those we be most intimately acquaint with and perfectly know when they be consider in an abstract way appear strangely difficult and incomprehensible time place and motion take in particular or concrete be what every body know but have pass through the hand of a metaphysician they become too abstract and fine to be apprehend by men of ordinary sense bid your servant meet you at such a time in such a place and he shall never stay to deliberate on the mean of those word in conceive that particular time and place or the motion by which he be to get thither he find not the least difficulty but if time be take exclusive of all those particular action and ideas that diversify the day merely for the continuation of existence or duration in abstract then it will perhaps gravel even a philosopher to comprehend it whenever i attempt to frame a simple idea of time abstract from the succession of ideas in my mind which flow uniformly and be participate by all be i be lose and embrangle in inextricable difficulties i have no notion of it at all only i hear others say it be infinitely divisible and speak of it in such a manner as lead me to entertain odd thoughts of my existence since that doctrine lay one under an absolute necessity of think either that he pass away innumerable age without a think or else that he be annihilate every moment of his life both which seem equally absurd time therefore be nothing abstract from the sucession of ideas in our mind it follow that the duration of any finite spirit must be estimate by the number of ideas or action succeed each other in that same spirit or mind hence it be a plain consequence that the soul always think and in truth whoever shall go about to divide in his thoughts or abstract the existence of a spirit from its cogitation will i believe find it no easy task so likewise when we attempt to abstract extension and motion from all other qualities and consider them by themselves we presently lose sight of them and run into great extravagancies all which depend on a twofold abstraction first it be suppose that extension for example may be abstract from all other sensible qualities and secondly that the entity of extension may be abstract from its be perceive but whoever shall reflect and take care to understand what he say will if i mistake not acknowledge that all sensible qualities be alike sensations and alike real that where the extension be there be the colour too to wit in his mind and that their archetypes can exist only in some other mind and that the object of sense be nothing but those sensations combine blend or if one may so speak concrete together none of all which can be suppose to exist unperceived what it be for a man to be happy or an object good every one may think he know but to frame an abstract idea of happiness prescinded from all particular pleasure or of goodness from every thing that be good this be what few can pretend to so likewise a man may be just and virtuous without have precise ideas of justice and virtue the opinion that those and the like word stand for general notions abstract from all particular persons and action seem to have render morality difficult and the study thereof of less use to mankind and in effect the doctrine of abstraction have not a little contribute towards spoil the most useful part of knowledge the two great provinces of speculative science conversant about ideas receive from sense and their relations be natural philosophy and mathematics with regard to each of these i shall make some observations and first i shall say somewhat of natural philosophy on this subject it be that the sceptics triumph all that stock of arguments they produce to depreciate our faculties and make mankind appear ignorant and low be draw principally from this head to wit that we be under an invincible blindness as to the true and real nature of things this they exaggerate and love to enlarge on we be miserably banter say they by our sense and amuse only with the outside and shew of things the real essence the internal qualities and constitution of every the meanest object be hide from our view something there be in every drop of water every grain of sand which it be beyond the power of humane understand to fathom or comprehend but it be evident from what have be shew that all this complaint be groundless and that we be influence by false principles to that degree as to mistrust our sense and think we know nothing of those things which we perfectly comprehend one great inducement to our pronounce our selves ignorant of the nature of things be the current opinion that every thing include within it self the cause of its properties or that there be in each object an inward essence which be the source whence its discernible qualities flow and whereon they depend some have pretend to account for appearances by occult qualities but of late they be mostly resolve into mechanical cause to wit the figure motion weight and such like qualities of insensible particles whereas in truth there be no other agent or efficient cause than spirit it be evident that motion as well as all other ideas be perfectly inert see sect hence to endeavour to explain the production of colour or sound by figure motion magnitude and the like must need be labour in vain and accordingly we see the attempt of that kind be not at all satisfactory which may be say in general of those instance wherein one idea or quality be assign for the cause of another i need not say how many hypotheses and speculations be leave out and how much the study of nature be abridge by this doctrine the great mechanical principle now in vogue be attraction that a stone fall to the earth or the sea swell towards the moon may to some appear sufficiently explain thereby but how be we enlighten by be tell this be do by attraction be it that that word signify the manner of the tendency and that it be by the mutual draw of body instead of their be impel or protrude towards each other but nothing be determine of the manner or action and it may as truly for ought we know be term impulse or protrusion as attraction again the part of steel we see cohere firmly together and this also be account for by attraction but in this as in the other instance i do not perceive that any thing be signify besides the effect it self for as to the manner of the action whereby it be produce or the cause which produce it these be not so much as aim at indeed if we take a view of the several phænomena and compare them together we may observe some liken and conformity between them for example in the fall of a stone to the grind in the rise of the sea towards the moon in cohesion and crystallization there be something alike namely an union or mutual approach of body so that any one of these or the like phænomena may not seem strange or surprise to a man who hath nicely observe and compare the effect of nature for that only be think so which be uncommon or a thing by it self and out of the ordinary course of our observation that body should tend towards the center of the earth be not think strange because it be what we perceive every moment of our live but that they should have a like gravitation towards the center of the moon may seem odd and unaccountable to most men because it be discern only in the tide but a philosopher whose thoughts take in a larger compass of nature have observe a certain similitude of appearances as well in the heavens as the earth that argue innumerable body to have a mutual tendency towards each other which he denote by the general name attraction whatever can be reduce to that he think justly account for thus he explain the tide by the attraction of the terraqueous globe towards the moon which to him doth not appear odd or anomalous but only a particular example of a general rule or law of nature if therefore we consider the difference there be betwixt natural philosophers and other men with regard to their knowledge of the phænomena we shall find it consist not in an exacter knowledge of the efficient cause that produce them for that can be no other than the will of a spirit but only in a greater largeness of comprehension whereby analogies harmonies and agreements be discover in the work of nature and the particular effect explain that be reduce to general rule see sect which rule ground on the analogy and uniformness observe in the production of natural effect be most agreeable and seek after by the mind for that they extend our prospect beyond what be present and near to us and enable us to make very probable conjecture touch things that may have happen at very great distance of time and place as well as to predict things to come which sort of endeavour towards omniscience be much affect by the mind but we should proceed warily in such things for we be apt to lay too great a stress on analogies and to the prejudice of truth humour that eagerness of the mind whereby it be carry to extend its knowledge into general theoremes for example gravitation or mutual attraction because it appear in many instance some be straightway for pronounce universal and that to attract and be attract by every other body be an essential quality inherent in all body whatsoever whereas it appear the fix star have no such tendency towards each other and so far be that gravitation from be essential to body that in some instance a quite contrary principle seem to shew it self as in the perpendicular growth of plant and the elasticity of the air there be nothing necessary or essential in the case but it depend intirely on the will of the govern spirit who cause certain body to cleave together or tend towards each other accord to various laws whilst he keep others at a fix distance and to some he give a quite contrary tendency to fly asunder just as he see convenient after what have be premise i think we may lay down the follow conclusions first it be plain philosophers amuse themselves in vain when they inquire for any natural efficient cause distinct from a mind or spirit secondly consider the whole creation be the workmanship of a wise and good agent it should seem to become philosophers to employ their thoughts contrary to what some hold about the final cause of things and i must confess i see no reason why point out the various end to which natural things be adapt and for which they be originally with unspeakable wisdom contrive should not be think one good way of account for them and altogether worthy a philosopher thirdly from what hath be premise no reason can be draw why the history of nature should not still be study and observations and experiment make which that they be of use to mankind and enable us to draw any general conclusions be not the result of any immutable habitudes or relations between things themselves but only of gods goodness and kindness to men in the administration of the world see sect and fourthly by a diligent observation of the phænomena within our view we may discover the general laws of nature and from them deduce the other phænomena i do not say demonstrate for all deductions of that kind depend on a supposition that the author of nature always operate uniformly and in a constant observance of those rule we take for principles which we can not evidently know those men who frame general rule from the phænomena and afterwards derive the phænomena from those rule seem to consider sign rather than cause a man may well understand natural sign without know their analogy or be able to say by what rule a thing be so or so and as it be very possible to write improperly through too strict an observance of general grammarrules so in argue from general rule of nature it be not impossible we may extend the analogy too far and by that mean run into mistake as in read other book a wise man will choose to fix his thoughts on the sense and apply it to use rather than lay them out in grammatical remark on the language so in peruse the volume of nature it seem beneath the dignity of the mind to affect an exactness in reduce each particular phænomenon to general rule or shew how it follow from them we should propose to ourselves nobler view such as to recreate and exalt the mind with a prospect of the beauty order extent and variety of natural things hence by proper inferences to enlarge our notions of the grandeur wisdom and beneficence of the creator and lastly to make the several part of the creation so far as in us lie subservient to the end they be design for gods glory and the sustentation and comfort of our selves and fellowcreatures the best key for the aforesaid analogy or natural science will be easily acknowledge to be a certain celebrate treatise of mechanics in the entrance of which justly admire treatise time space and motion be distinguish into absolute and relative true and apparent mathematical and vulgar which distinction as it be at large explain by the author doth suppose those quantities to have an existence without the mind and that they be ordinarily conceive with relation to sensible things to which nevertheless in their own nature they bear no relation at all as for time as it be there take in an absolute or abstract sense for the duration or perseverance of the existence of things i have nothing more to add concern it after what hath be already say on that subject sect and for the rest this celebrate author hold there be an absolute space which be unperceivable to sense remain in it self similar and immoveable and relative space to be the measure thereof which be moveable and define by its situation in respect of sensible body be vulgarly take for immoveable space place he define to be that part of space which be occupy by any body and accord as the space be absolute or relative so also be the place absolute motion be say to be the translation of a body from absolute place to absolute place as relative motion be from one relative place to another and because the part of absolute space do not fall under our sense instead of them we be oblige to use their sensible measure and so define both place and motion with respect to body which we regard as immoveable but it be say in philosophical matter we must abstract from our sense since it may be that none of those body which seem to be quiescent be truly so and the same thing which be move relatively may be really at rest as likewise one and the same body may be in relative rest and motion or even move with contrary relative motion at the same time accord as its place be variously define all which ambiguity be to be find in the apparent motion but not at all in the true or absolute which should therefore be alone regard in philosophy and the true we be tell be distinguish from apparent or relative motion by the follow properties first in true or absolute motion all part which preserve the same position with respect to the whole partake of the motion of the whole secondly the place be move that which be place therein be also move so that a body move in a place which be in motion doth participate the motion of its place thirdly true motion be never generate or change otherwise than by force impress on the body it self fourthly true motion be always change by force impress on the body move fifthly in circular motion barely relative there be no centrifugal force which nevertheless in that which be true or absolute be proportional to the quantity of motion but notwithstanding what hath be say it doth not appear to me that there can be any motion other than relative so that to conceive motion there must be at least conceive two body whereof the distance or position in regard to each other be vary hence if there be one only body in be it could not possibly be move this seem evident in that the idea i have of motion doth necessarily include relation but though in every motion it be necessary to conceive more body than one yet it may be that one only be move namely that on which the force cause the change of distance be impress or in other word that to which the action be apply for however some may define relative motion so as to term that body move which change its distance from some other body whether the force or action cause that change be apply to it or no yet as relative motion be that which be perceive by sense and regard in the ordinary affairs of life it should seem that every man of common sense know what it be as well as the best philosopher now i ask any one whether in his sense of motion as he walk along the streets the stone he pass over may be say to move because they change distance with his feet to me it seem that though motion include a relation of one thing to another yet it be not necessary that each term of the relation be denominate from it as a man may think of somewhat which doth not think so a body may be move to or from another body which be not therefore it self in motion as the place happen to be variously define the motion which be relate to it vary a man in a ship may be say to be quiescent with relation to the side of the vessel and yet move with relation to the land or he may move eastward in respect of the one and westward in respect of the other in the common affairs of life men never go beyond the earth to define the place of any body and what be quiescent in respect of that be account absolutely to be so but philosophers who have a greater extent of think and juster notions of the system of things discover even the earth it self to be move in order therefore to fix their notions they seem to conceive the corporeal world as finite and the utmost unmoved wall or shell thereof to be the place whereby they estimate true motion if we sound our own conceptions i believe we may find all the absolute motion we can frame an idea of to be at bottom no other than relative motion thus define for as hath be already observe absolute motion exclusive of all external relation be incomprehensible and to this kind of relative motion all the abovementioned properties cause and effect ascribe to absolute motion will if i mistake not be find to agree as to what be say of the centrifugal force that it doth not at all belong to circular relative motion i do not see how this follow from the experiment which be bring to prove it see philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica in schol def for the water in the vessel at that time wherein it be say to have the greatest relative circular motion hath i think no motion at all as be plain from the forego section for to denominate a body move it be requisite first that it change its distance or situation with regard to some other body and secondly that the force or action occasion that change be apply to it if either of these be want i do not think that agreeably to the sense of mankind or the propriety of language a body can be say to be in motion i grant indeed that it be possible for us to think a body which we see change its distance from some other to be move though it have no force apply to it in which sense there may be apparent motion but then it be because the force cause the change of distance be imagine by us to be apply or impress on that body think to move which indeed shew we be capable of mistake a thing to be in motion which be not and that be all from what hath be say it follow that the philosophic consideration of motion doth not imply the be of an absolute space distinct from that which be perceive by sense and relate to body which that it can not exist without the mind be clear upon the same principles that demonstrate the like of all other object of sense and perhaps if we inquire narrowly we shall find we can not even frame an idea of pure space exclusive of all body this i must confess seem impossible as be a most abstract idea when i excite a motion in some part of my body if it be free or without resistance i say there be space but if i find a resistance then i say there be body and in proportion as the resistance to motion be lesser or greater i say the space be more or less pure so that when i speak of pure or empty space it be not to be suppose that the word space stand for an idea distinct from or conceivable without body and motion though indeed we be apt to think every noun substantive stand for a distinct idea that may be separate from all others which hath occasion infinite mistake when therefore suppose all the world to be annihilate besides my own body i say there still remain pure space thereby nothing else be mean but only that i conceive it possible for the limbs of my body to be move on all side without the least resistance but if that too be annihilate then there could be no motion and consequently no space some perhaps may think the sense of see doth furnish them with the idea of pure space but it be plain from what we have elsewhere shew that the ideas of space and distance be not obtain by that sense see the essay concern vision what be here lay down seem to put an end to all those dispute and difficulties which have spring up amongst the learn concern the nature of pure space but the chief advantage arise from it be that we be free from that dangerous dilemma to which several who have employ their thoughts on this subject imagine themselves reduce to wit of think either that real space be god or else that there be something beside god which be eternal uncreated infinite indivisible immutable both which may justly be think pernicious and absurd notions it be certain that not a few divine as well as philosophers of great note have from the difficulty they find in conceive either limit or annihilation of space conclude it must be divine and some of late have set themselves particularly to shew that the incommunicable attribute of god agree to it which doctrine how unworthy soever it may seem of the divine nature yet i do not see how we can get clear of it so long as we adhere to the receive opinions hitherto of natural philosophy we come now to make some inquiry concern that other great branch of speculative knowledge to wit mathematics these how celebrate soever they may be for their clearness and certainty of demonstration which be hardly any where else to be find can not nevertheless be suppose altogether free from mistake if in their principles there lurk some secret error which be common to the professors of those sciences with the rest of mankind mathematicians though they deduce their theoremes from a great height of evidence yet their first principles be limit by the consideration of quantity and they do not ascend into any inquiry concern those transcendental maxims which influence all the particular sciences each part whereof mathematics not except doth consequently participate of the errors involve in them that the principles lay down by mathematicians be true and their way of deduction from those principles clear and incontestible we do not deny but we hold there may be certain erroneous maxims of greater extent than the object of mathematics and for that reason not expresly mention though tacitly suppose throughout the whole progress of that science and that the ill effect of those secret unexamined errors be diffuse through all the branch thereof to be plain we suspect the mathematicians be as well as other men concern in the errors arise from the doctrine of abstract general ideas and the existence of object without the mind arithmetic hath be think to have for its object abstract ideas of number of which to understand the properties and mutual habitudes be suppose no mean part of speculative knowledge the opinion of the pure and intellectual nature of number in abstract hath make them in esteem with those philosophers who seem to have affect an uncommon fineness and elevation of think it hath set a price on the most trifle numerical speculations which in practice be of no use but serve only for amusement and hath therefore so far infect the mind of some that they have dream of mighty mysteries involve in number and attempt the explication of natural things by them but if we inquire into our own thoughts and consider what hath be premise we may perhaps entertain a low opinion of those high flight and abstractions and look on all inquiries about number only as so many difficiles nugæ so far as they be not subservient to practice and promote the benefit of life unity in abstract we have before consider in sect from which and what hath be say in the introduction it plainly follow there be not any such idea but number be define a collection of unite we may conclude that if there be no such thing as unity or unite in abstract there be no ideas of number in abstract denote by the numeral name and figure the theories therefore in arithmetic if they be abstract from the name and figure as likewise from all use and practice as well as from the particular things number can be suppose to have nothing at all for their object hence we may see how intirely the science of number be subordinate to practice and how jejune and trifle it become when consider as a matter of mere speculation however since there may be some who delude by the specious shew of discover abstract verities waste their time in arithmetical theoremes and problemes which have not any use it will not be amiss if we more fully consider and expose the vanity of that pretence and this will plainly appear by take a view of arithmetic in its infancy and observe what it be that originally put men on the study of that science and to what scope they direct it it be natural to think that at first men for ease of memory and help of computation make use of counter or in write of single stroke point or the like each whereof be make to signify an unite that be some one thing of whatever kind they have occasion to reckon afterwards they find out the more compendious ways of make one character stand in place of several stroke or point and lastly the notation of the arabians or indians come into use wherein by the repetition of a few character or figure and vary the signification of each figure accord to the place it obtain all number may be most aptly express which seem to have be do in imitation of language so that an exact analogy be observe betwixt the notation by figure and name the nine simple figure answer the nine first numeral name and place in the former correspond to denominations in the latter and agreeably to those condition of the simple and local value of figure be contrive methods of find from the give figure or mark of the part what figure and how place be proper to denote the whole or vice versa and have find the seek figure the same rule or analogy be observe throughout it be easy to read them into word and so the number become perfectly know for then the number of any particular things be say to be know when we know the name or figure with their due arrangement that accord to the stand analogy belong to them for these sign be know we can by the operations of arithmetic know the sign of any part of the particular sum signify by them and thus compute in sign because of the connexion establish betwixt them and the distinct multitudes of things whereof one be take for an unite we may be able rightly to sum up divide and proportion the things themselves that we intend to number in arithmetic therefore we regard not the things but the sign which nevertheless be not regard for their own sake but because they direct us how to act with relation to things and dispose rightly of them now agreeably to what we have before observe of word in general sect introd it happen here likewise that abstract ideas be think to be signify by numeral name or character while they do not suggest ideas of particular things to our mind i shall not at present enter into a more particular dissertation on this subject but only observe that it be evident from what hath be say those things which pass for abstract truths and theoremes concern number be in reality conversant about no object distinct from particular numerable things except only name and character which originally come to be consider on no other account but their be sign or capable to represent aptly whatever particular things men have need to compute whence it follow that to study them for their own sake would be just as wise and to as good purpose as if a man neglect the true use or original intention and subserviency of language should spend his time in impertinent criticisms upon word or reason and controversies purely verbal from number we proceed to speak of extension which consider as relative be the object of geometry the infinite divisibility of finite extension though it be not expresly lay down either as an axiome or theoreme in the elements of that science yet be throughout the same every where suppose and think to have so inseparable and essential a connexion with the principles and demonstrations in geometry that mathematicians never admit it into doubt or make the least question of it and as this notion be the source from whence do spring all those amuse geometrical paradoxes which have such a direct repugnancy to the plain common sense of mankind and be admit with so much reluctance into a mind not yet debauch by learn so it be the principal occasion of all that nice and extreme subtilty which render the study of mathematics so difficult and tedious hence if we can make it appear that no finite extension contain innumerable part or be infinitely divisible it follow that we shall at once clear the science of geometry from a great number of difficulties and contradictions which have ever be esteem a reproach to humane reason and withal make the attainment thereof a business of much less time and pain than it hitherto hath be every particular finite extension which may possibly be the object of our think be an idea exist only in the mind and consequently each part thereof must be perceive if therefore i can not perceive innumerable part in any finite extension that i consider it be certain they be not contain in it but it be evident that i can not distinguish innumerable part in any particular line surface or solid which i either perceive by sense or figure to my self in my mind wherefore i conclude they be not contain in it nothing can be plainer to me than that the extensions i have in view be no other than my own ideas and it be no less plain that i can not resolve any one of my ideas into an infinite number of other ideas that be that they be not infinitely divisible if by finite extension be mean something distinct from a finite idea i declare i do not know what that be and so can not affirm or deny any thing of it but if the term extension part and the like be take in any sense conceivable that be for ideas then to say a finite quantity or extension consist of part infinite in number be so manifest a contradiction that every one at first sight acknowledge it to be so and it be impossible it should ever gain the assent of any reasonable creature who be not bring to it by gentle and slow degrees as a convert gentile to the belief of transubstantiation ancient and root prejudice do often pass into principles and those proposition which once obtain the force and credit of a principle be not only themselves but likewise whatever be deducible from them think privilege from all examination and there be no absurdity so gross which by this mean the mind of man may not be prepare to swallow he whose understand be prepossest with the doctrine of abstract general ideas may be persuade that whatever be think of the ideas of sense extension in abstract be infinitely divisible and one who think the object of sense exist without the mind will perhaps in virtue thereof be bring to admit that a line but an inch long may contain innumerable part really exist though too small to be discern these errors be graft as well in the mind of geometricians as of other men and have a like influence on their reason and it be no difficult thing to shew how the arguments from geometry make use of to support the infinite divisibility of extension be bottom on them at present we shall only observe in general whence it be that the mathematicians be all so fond and tenacious of this doctrine it hath be observe in another place that the theoremes and demonstrations in geometry be conversant about universal ideas sect introd where it be explain in what sense this ought to be understand to wit that the particular line and figure include in the diagram be suppose to stand for innumerable others of different size or in other word the geometer consider them abstract from their magnitude which doth not imply that he form an abstract idea but only that he care not what the particular magnitude be whether great or small but look on that as a thing indifferent to the demonstration hence it follow that a line in the scheme but an inch long must be speak of as though it contain ten thousand part since it be regard not in it self but as it be universal and it be universal only in its signification whereby it represent innumerable line greater than it self in which may be distinguish ten thousand part or more though there may not be above an inch in it after this manner the properties of the line signify be by a very usual figure transfer to the sign and thence through mistake think to appertain to it consider in its own nature because there be no number of part so great but it be possible there may be a line contain more the inchline be say to contain part more than any assignable number which be true not of the inch take absolutely but only for the things signify by it but men not retain that distinction in their thoughts slide into a belief that the small particular line describe on paper contain in it self part innumerable there be no such thing as the tenthousandth part of an inch but there be of a mile or diameter of the earth which may be signify by that inch when therefore i delineate a triangle on paper and take one side not above an inch for example in length to be the radius this i consider as divide into ten thousand or an hundred thousand part or more for though the tenthousandth part of that line consider in it self be nothing at all and consequently may be neglect without any error or inconveniency yet these describe line be only mark stand for greater quantities whereof it may be the tenthousandth part be very considerable it follow that to prevent notable errors in practice the radius must be take of ten thousand part or more from what hath be say the reason be plain why to the end any theoreme may become universal in its use it be necessary we speak of the line describe on paper as though they contain part which really they do not in do of which if we examine the matter throughly we shall perhaps discover that we can not conceive an inch it self as consist of or be divisible into a thousand part but only some other line which be far greater than an inch and represent by it and that when we say a line be infinitely divisible we must mean a line which be infinitely great what we have here observe seem to be the chief cause why to suppose the infinite divisibility of finite extension hath be think necessary in geometry the several absurdities and contradictions which flow from this false principle might one would think have be esteem so many demonstrations against it but by i know not what logic it be hold that proof a posteriori be not to be admit against proposition relate to infinity as though it be not impossible even for an infinite mind to reconcile contradictions or as if any thing absurd and repugnant could have a necessary connexion with truth or flow from it but whoever consider the weakness of this pretence will think it be contrive on purpose to humour the laziness of the mind which have rather acquiesce in an indolent scepticism than be at the pain to go through with a severe examination of those principles it hath ever embrace for true of late the speculations about infinities have run so high and grow to such strange notions as have occasion no small scruple and dispute among the geometers of the present age some there be of great note who not content with hold that finite line may be divide into an infinite number of part do yet farther maintain that each of those infinitesimals be it self subdivisible into an infinity of other part or infinitesimals of a second order and so on ad infinitum these i say assert there be infinitesimals of infinitesimals of infinitesimals without ever come to an end so that accord to them an inch doth not barely contain an infinite number of part but an infinity of an infinity of an infinity ad infinitum of part others there be who hold all order of infinitesimals below the first to be nothing at all think it with good reason absurd to imagine there be any positive quantity or part of extension which though multiply infinitely can ever equal the smallest give extension and yet on the other hand it seem no less absurd to think the square cube or other power of a positive real root should it self be nothing at all which they who hold infinitesimals of the first order deny all of the subsequent order be oblige to maintain have we not therefore reason to conclude they be both in the wrong and that there be in effect no such thing as part infinitely small or an infinite number of part contain in any finite quantity but you will say that if this doctrine obtain it will follow the very foundations of geometry be destroy and those great men who have raise that science to so astonish an height have be all the while build a castle in the air to this it may be reply that whatever be useful in geometry and promote the benefit of humane life doth still remain firm and unshaken on our principles that science consider as practical will rather receive advantage than any prejudice from what hath be say but to set this in a due light may be the subject of a distinct inquiry for the rest though it should follow that some of the more intricate and subtile part of speculative mathematics may be par off without any prejudice to truth yet i do not see what damage will be thence derive to mankind on the contrary it be highly to be wish that men of great abilities and obstinate application would draw off their thoughts from those amusements and employ them in the study of such things as lie nearer the concern of life or have a more direct influence on the manners if it be say that several theoremes undoubtedly true be discover by methods in which infinitesimals be make use of which could never have be if their existence include a contradiction in it i answer that upon a thorough examination it will not be find that in any instance it be necessary to make use of or conceive infinitesimal part of finite line or even quantities less than the minimum sensible nay it will be evident this be never do it be impossible by what we have premise it be plain that very numerous and important errors have take their rise from those false principles which be impugn in the forego part of this treatise and the opposites of those erroneous tenets at the same time appear to be most fruitful principles from whence do flow innumerable consequences highly advantageous to true philosophy as well as to religion particularly matter or the absolute existence of corporeal object hath be shew to be that wherein the most avow and pernicious enemies of all knowledge whether humane or divine have ever place their chief strength and confidence and surely if by distinguish the real existence of unthinking things from their be perceive and allow them a subsistence of their own out of the mind of spirit no one thing be explain in nature but on the contrary a great many inexplicable difficulties arise if the supposition of matter be barely precarious as not be ground on so much as one single reason if its consequences can not endure the light of examination and free inquiry but skreen themselves under the dark and general pretence of infinites be incomprehensible if withal the removal of this matter be not attend with the least evil consequence if it be not even miss in the world but every thing as well nay much easier conceive without it if lastly both sceptics and atheists be for ever silence upon suppose only spirit and ideas and this scheme of things be perfectly agreeable both to reason and religion methinks we may expect it should be admit and firmly embrace though it be propose only as an hypothesis and the existence of matter have be allow possible which yet i think we have evidently demonstrate that it be not true it be that in consequence of the forego principles several dispute and speculations which be esteem no mean part of learn be reject as useless but how great a prejudice soever against our notions this may give to those who have already be deeply engage and make large advance in study of that nature yet by others we hope it will not be think any just grind of dislike to the principles and tenets herein lay down that they abridge the labour of study and make humane sciences more clear compendious and attainable than they be before have despatch what we intend to say concern the knowledge of ideas the method we propose lead us in the next place to treat of spirit with regard to which perhaps humane knowledge be not so deficient as be vulgarly imagine the great reason that be assign for our be think ignorant of the nature of spirit be our not have an idea of it but surely it ought not to be look on as a defect in a humane understand that it do not perceive the idea of spirit if it be manifestly impossible there should be any such idea and this if i mistake not have be demonstrate in sect to which i shall here add that a spirit have be shew to be the only substance or support wherein the unthinking be or ideas can exist but that this substance which support or perceive ideas should it self be an idea or like an idea be evidently absurd it will perhaps be say that we want a sense as some have imagine proper to know substances withal which if we have we might know our own soul as we do a triangle to this i answer that in case we have a new sense bestow upon us we could only receive thereby some new sensations or ideas of sense but i believe no body will say that what he mean by the term soul and substance be only some particular sort of idea or sensation we may therefore infer that all things duly consider it be not more reasonable to think our faculties defective in that they do not furnish us with an idea of spirit or active think substance than it would be if we should blame them for not be able to comprehend a round square from the opinion that spirit be to be know after the manner of an idea or sensation have rise many absurd and heterodox tenets and much scepticism about the nature of the soul it be even probable that this opinion may have produce a doubt in some whether they have any soul at all distinct from their body since upon inquiry they could not find they have an idea of it that an idea which be inactive and the existence whereof consist in be perceive should be the image or liken of an agent subsist by it self seem to need no other refutation than barely attend to what be mean by those word but perhaps you will say that tho an idea can not resemble a spirit in its think act or subsist by it self yet it may in some other respect and it be not necessary that an idea or image be in all respect like the original i answer if it do not in those mention it be impossible it should represent it in any other thing do but leave out the power of will think and perceive ideas and there remain nothing else wherein the idea can be like a spirit for by the word spirit we mean only that which think will and perceive this and this alone constitute the signification of that term if therefore it be impossible that any degree of those power should be represent in an idea it be evident there can be no idea of a spirit but it will be object that if there be no idea signify by the term soul spirit and substance they be wholly insignificant or have no mean in them i answer those word do mean or signify a real thing which be neither an idea nor like an idea but that which perceive ideas and will and reason about them what i be my self that which i denote by the term i be the same with what be mean by soul or spiritual substance if it be say that this be only quarrel at a word and that since the immediate significations of other name be by common consent call ideas no reason can be assign why that which be signify by the name spirit or soul may not partake in the same appellation i answer all the unthinking object of the mind agree in that they be intirely passive and their existence consist only in be perceive whereas a soul or spirit be an active be whose existence consist not in be perceive but in perceive ideas and think it be therefore necessary in order to prevent equivocation and confound natures perfectly disagree and unlike that we distinguish between spirit and idea see sect in a large sense indeed we may be say to have an idea or rather a notion of spirit that be we understand the mean of the word otherwise we could not affirm or deny any thing of it moreover as we conceive the ideas that be in the mind of other spirit by mean of our own which we suppose to be resemblances of them so we know other spirit by mean of our own soul which in that sense be the image or idea of them it have a like respect to other spirit that blueness or heat by me perceive have to those ideas perceive by another it must not be suppose that they who assert the natural immortality of the soul be of opinion that it be absolutely incapable of annihilation even by the infinite power of the creator who first give it be but only that it be not liable to be break or dissolve by the ordinary laws of nature or motion they indeed who hold the soul of man to be only a thin vital flame or system of animal spirit make it perish and corruptible as the body since there be nothing more easily dissipate than such a be which it be naturally impossible should survive the ruin of the tabernacle wherein it be inclose and this notion hath be greedily embrace and cherish by the worst part of mankind as the most effectual antidote against all impressions of virtue and religion but it hath be make evident that body of what frame or texture soever be barely passive ideas in the mind which be more distant and heterogeneous from them than light be from darkness we have shew that the soul be indivisible incorporeal unextended and it be consequently incorruptible nothing can be plainer than that the motion change decay and dissolutions which we hourly see befal natural body and which be what we mean by the course of nature can not possibly affect an active simple uncompounded substance such a be therefore be indissoluble by the force of nature that be to say the soul of man be naturally immortal after what hath be say it be i suppose plain that our souls be not to be know in the same manner as senseless inactive object or by way of idea spirit and ideas be things so wholly different that when we say they exist they be know or the like these word must not be think to signify any thing common to both natures there be nothing alike or common in them and to expect that by any multiplication or enlargement of our faculties we may be enable to know a spirit as we do a triangle seem as absurd as if we should hope to see a sound this be inculcate because i imagine it may be of moment towards clear several important question and prevent some very dangerous errors concern the nature of the soul we may not i think strictly be say to have an idea of an active be or of an action although we may be say to have a notion of them i have some knowledge or notion of my mind and its act about ideas inasmuch as i know or understand what be mean by those word what i know that i have some notion of i will not say that the term idea and notion may not be use convertibly if the world will have it so but yet it conduceth to clearness and propriety that we distinguish things very different by different name it be also to be remark that all relations include an act of the mind we can not so properly be say to have an idea but rather a notion of the relations and habitudes between things but if in the modern way the word idea be extend to spirit and relations and act this be after all an affair of verbal concern it will not be amiss to add that the doctrine of abstract ideas hath have no small share in render those sciences intricate and obscure which be particularly conversant about spiritual things men have imagine they could frame abstract notions of the power and act of the mind and consider them prescinded as well from the mind or spirit it self as from their respective object and effect hence a great number of dark and ambiguous term presume to stand for abstract notions have be introduce into metaphysics and morality and from these have grow infinite distractions and dispute amongst the learn but nothing seem more to have contribute towards engage men in controversies and mistake with regard to the nature and operations of the mind than the be use to speak of those things in term borrow from sensible ideas for example the will be term the motion of the soul this infuse a belief that the mind of man be as a ball in motion impel and determine by the object of sense as necessarily as that be by the stroke of a racket hence arise endless scruple and errors of dangerous consequence in morality all which i doubt not may be clear and truth appear plain uniform and consistent could but philosophers be prevail on to retire into themselves and attentively consider their own mean from what hath be say it be plain that we can not know the existence of other spirit otherwise than by their operations or the ideas by them excite in us i perceive several motion change and combinations of ideas that inform me there be certain particular agents like my self which accompany them and concur in their production hence the knowledge i have of other spirit be not immediate as be the knowledge of my ideas but depend on the intervention of ideas by me refer to agents or spirit distinct from my self as effect or concomitant sign but though there be some things which convince us humane agents be concern in produce them yet it be evident to every one that those things which be call the work of nature that be the far greater part of the ideas or sensations perceive by us be not produce by or dependent on the will of men there be therefore some other spirit that cause them since it be repugnant that they should subsist by themselves see sect but if we attentively consider the constant regularity order and concatenation of natural things the surprise magnificence beauty and perfection of the larger and the exquisite contrivance of the smaller part of creation together with the exact harmony and correspondence of the whole but above all the never enough admire laws of pain and pleasure and the instincts or natural inclinations appetites and passions of animals i say if we consider all these things and at the same time attend to the mean and import of the attribute one eternal infinitely wise good and perfect we shall clearly perceive that they belong to the aforesaid spirit who work all in all and by whom all things consist hence it be evident that god be know as certainly and immediately as any other mind or spirit whatsoever distinct from our selves we may even assert that the existence of god be far more evidently perceive than the existence of men because the effect of nature be infinitely more numerous and considerable than those ascribe to humane agents there be not any one mark that denote a man or effect produce by him which doth not more strongly evince the be of that spirit who be the author of nature for it be evident that in affect other persons the will of man hath no other object than barely the motion of the limbs of his body but that such a motion should be attend by or excite any idea in the mind of another depend wholly on the will of the creator he alone it be who uphold all things by the word of his power maintain that intercourse between spirit whereby they be able to perceive the existence of each other and yet this pure and clear light which enlighten every one be it self invisible it seem to be a general pretence of the unthinking herd that they can not see god could we but see him say they as we see a man we should believe that he be and believe obey his command but alas we need only open our eye to see the sovereign lord of all things with a more full and clear view than we do any one of our fellowcreatures not that i imagine we see god as some will have it by a direct and immediate view or see corporeal things not by themselves but by see that which represent them in the essence of god which doctrine be i must confess to me incomprehensible but i shall explain my mean a humane spirit or person be not perceive by sense as not be an idea when therefore we see the colour size figure and motion of a man we perceive only certain sensations or ideas excite in our own mind and these be exhibit to our view in sundry distinct collections serve to mark out unto us the existence of finite and create spirit like our selves hence it be plain we do not see a man if by man be mean that which live move perceive and think as we do but only such a certain collection of ideas as direct us to think there be a distinct principle of think and motion like to our selves accompany and represent by it and after the same manner we see god all the difference be that whereas some one finite and narrow assemblage of ideas denote a particular humane mind whithersoever we direct our view we do at all time and in all place perceive manifest tokens of the divinity every thing we see hear feel or any wise perceive by sense be a sign or effect of the power of god as be our perception of those very motion which be produce by men it be therefore plain that nothing can be more evident to any one that be capable of the least reflexion than the existence of god or a spirit who be intimately present to our mind produce in them all that variety of ideas or sensations which continually affect us on whom we have an absolute and intire dependence in short in whom we live and move and have our be that the discovery of this great truth which lie so near and obvious to the mind should be attain to by the reason of so very few be a sad instance of the stupidity and inattention of men who though they be surround with such clear manifestations of the deity be yet so little affect by them that they seem as it be blind with excess of light but you will say hath nature no share in the production of natural things and must they be all ascribe to the immediate and sole operation of god i answer if by nature be mean only the visible series of effect or sensations imprint on our mind accord to certain fix and general laws then it be plain that nature take in this sense can not produce any thing at all but if by nature be mean some be distinct from god as well as from the laws of nature and things perceive by sense i must confess that word be to me an empty sound without any intelligible mean annex to it nature in this acceptation be a vain chimera introduce by those heathens who have not just notions of the omnipresence and infinite perfection of god but it be more unaccountable that it should be receive among christians profess belief in the holy scriptures which constantly ascribe those effect to the immediate hand of god that heathen philosophers be wont to impute to nature the lord he causeth the vapours to ascend he maketh lightnings with rain he bringeth forth the wind out of his treasure jerem chap ver he turneth the shadow of death into the morning and maketh the day dark with night amos chap ver he visiteth the earth and maketh it soft with shower he blesseth the spring thereof and crowneth the year with his goodness so that the pasture be clothe with flock and the valleys be cover over with corn see psalm but notwithstanding that this be the constant language of scripture yet we have i know not what aversion from believe that god concern himself so nearly in our affairs fain would we suppose him at a great distance off and substitute some blind unthinking deputy in his stead though if we may believe saint paul he be not far from every one of us it will i doubt not be object that the slow and gradual methods observe in the production of natural things do not seem to have for their cause the immediate hand of an almighty agent besides monsters untimely birth fruit blast in the blossom rain fall in desert place miseries incident to humane life be so many arguments that the whole frame of nature be not immediately actuate and superintend by a spirit of infinite wisdom and goodness but the answer to this objection be in a good measure plain from sect it be visible that the aforesaid methods of nature be absolutely necessary in order to work by the most simple and general rule and after a steady and consistent manner which argue both the wisdom and goodness of god such be the artificial contrivance of this mighty machine of nature that whilst its motion and various phænomena strike on our sense the hand which actuate the whole be it self unperceivable to men of flesh and blood verily saith the prophet thou art a god that hidest thy self isaiah chap ver but though god conceal himself from the eye of the sensual and lazy who will not be at the least expense of think yet to an unbiassed and attentive mind nothing can be more plainly legible than the intimate presence of an allwise spirit who fashion regulate and sustain the whole systeme of be it be clear from what we have elsewhere observe that the operate accord to general and state laws be so necessary for our guidance in the affairs of life and let us into the secret of nature that without it all reach and compass of think all humane sagacity and design could serve to no manner of purpose it be even impossible there should be any such faculties or power in the mind see sect which one consideration abundantly outbalance whatever particular inconvenience may thence arise we should further consider that the very blemish and defect of nature be not without their use in that they make an agreeable sort of variety and augment the beauty of the rest of the creation as shade in a picture serve to set off the brighter and more enlighten part we would likewise do well to examine whether our tax the waste of seed and embryos and accidental destruction of plant and animals before they come to full maturity as an imprudence in the author of nature be not the effect of prejudice contract by our familiarity with impotent and save mortals in man indeed a thrifty management of those things which he can not procure without much pain and industry may be esteem wisdom but we must not imagine that the inexplicably fine machine of an animal or vegetable cost the great creator any more pain or trouble in its production than a pebble doth nothing be more evident than that an omnipotent spirit can indifferently produce every thing by a mere fiat or act of his will hence it be plain that the splendid profusion of natural things should not be interpret weakness or prodigality in the agent who produce them but rather be look on as an argument of the riches of his power as for the mixture of pain or uneasiness which be in the world pursuant to the general laws of nature and the action of finite imperfect spirit this in the state we be in at present be indispensably necessary to our wellbeing but our prospect be too narrow we take for instance the idea of some one particular pain into our thoughts and account it evil whereas if we enlarge our view so as to comprehend the various end connexions and dependencies of things on what occasion and in what proportion we be affect with pain and pleasure the nature of humane freedom and the design with which we be put into the world we shall be force to acknowledge that those particular things which consider in themselves appear to be evil have the nature of good when consider as link with the whole systeme of be from what hath be say it will be manifest to any consider person that it be merely for want of attention and comprehensiveness of mind that there be any favourers of atheism or the manichean heresy to be find little and unreflecting souls may indeed burlesque the work of providence the beauty and order whereof they have not capacity or will not be at the pain to comprehend but those who be master of any justness and extent of think and be withal use to reflect can never sufficiently admire the divine trace of wisdom and goodness that shine throughout the oeconomy of nature but what truth be there which shineth so strongly on the mind that by an aversion of think a wilful shut of the eye we may not escape see it be it therefore to be wonder at if the generality of men who be ever intent on business or pleasure and little use to fix or open the eye of their mind should not have all that conviction and evidence of the be of god which might be expect in reasonable creatures we should rather wonder that men can be find so stupid as to neglect than that neglect they should be unconvinced of such an evident and momentous truth and yet it be to be fear that too many of part and leisure who live in christian countries be merely through a supine and dreadful negligence sink into a sort of atheism since it be downright impossible that a soul pierce and enlighten with a thorough sense of the omnipresence holiness and justice of that almighty spirit should persist in a remorseless violation of his laws we ought therefore earnestly to meditate and dwell on those important point that so we may attain conviction without all scruple that the eye of the lord be in every place behold the evil and the good that he be with us and keepeth us in all place whither we go and giveth us bread to eat and raiment to put on that he be present and conscious to our innermost thoughts and that we have a most absolute and immediate dependence on him a clear view of which great truths can not choose but fill our hearts with an awful circumspection and holy fear which be the strongest incentive to virtue and the best guard against vice for after all what deserve the first place in our study be the consideration of god and our duty which to promote as it be the main drift and design of my labour so shall i esteem them altogether useless and ineffectual if by what i have say i can not inspire my readers with a pious sense of the presence of god and have shew the falseness or vanity of those barren speculations which make the chief employment of learn men the better dispose them to reverence and embrace the salutary truths of the gospel which to know and to practice be the highest perfection of humane naturean essay towards a new theory of vision by george berkeley content sect design distance of itself invisible remote distance perceive rather by experience than by sense near distance think to be perceive by the angle of the optic ax difference between this and the former manner of perceive distance also by diverge ray this depend not on experience these the common account but not satisfactory some ideas perceive by the mediation of others no idea which be not itself perceive can be the mean of perceive another distance perceive by mean of some other idea those line and angle mention in optics be not themselves perceive hence the mind do not perceive distance by line and angle also because they have no real existence and because they be insufficient to explain the phenomena the ideas that suggest distance be st the sensation arise from the turn of the eye betwixt which and distance there be no necessary connection scarce room for mistake in this matter no regard have to the angle of the optic ax judgment of distance make with both eye the result of experience ndly confusedness of appearance this the occasion of those judgments attribute to diverge ray objection answer what deceive the writers of optics in this matter the cause why one idea may suggest another this apply to confusion and distance thirrdly the strain of the eye the occasion which suggest distance have in their own nature no relation to it a difficult case propose by dr barrow as repugnant to all the know theories this case contradict a receive principle in catoptrics it be show to agree with the principles we have lay down this phenomenon illustrate it confirm the truth of the principle whereby it be explain vision when distinct and when confuse the different effect of parallel diverge and converge ray how converge and diverge ray come to suggest the same distance a person extreme purblind would judge aright in the forementioned case line and angle why useful in optics the not understand this a cause of mistake a query propose by mr molyneux in his dioptrics consider one bear blind would not at first have any idea of distance by sight this not agreeable to the common principles the proper object of sight not without the mind nor the image of any thing without the mind this more fully explain in what sense we must be understand to see distance and external things distance and things place at a distance not otherwise perceive by the eye than by the ear the ideas of sight more apt to be confound with the ideas of touch than those of hear be how this come to pass strictly speak we never see and feel the same thing object of sight twofold mediate and immediate these hard to separate in our thoughts the receive account of our perceive magnitude by sight false magnitude perceive as immediately as distance two kinds of sensible extension neither of which be infinitely divisible the tangible magnitude of an object steady the visible not by what mean tangible magnitude be perceive by sight this further enlarge on no necessary connection between confusion or faintness of appearance and small or great magnitude the tangible magnitude of an object more heed than the visible and why an instance of this men do not measure by visible feet or inch no necessary connection between visible and tangible extension greater visible magnitude might signify lesser tangible magnitude the judgments we make of magnitude depend altogether on experience distance and magnitude see as shame or anger but we be prone to think otherwise and why the moon seem greater in the horizon than in the meridian the cause of this phenomenon assign the horizontal moon why greater at one time than another the account we have give prove to be true and confirm by the moon appear greater in a mist objection answer the way wherein faintness suggest greater magnitude illustrate appearance of the horizontal moon why think difficult to explain attempt towards the solution of it make by several but in vain the opinion of dr wallis it be show to be unsatisfactory how line and angle may be of use in compute apparent magnitudes one bear blind be make to see what judgment he would make of magnitude the minimum visible the same to all creatures objection answer the eye at all time perceive the same number of visible point two imperfections in the visive faculty answer to which we may conceive two perfections in neither of these two ways do microscopes improve the sight the case of microscopical eye consider the sight admirably adapt to the end of see difficulty concern erect vision the common way of explain it the same show to be false not distinguish between ideas of sight and touch cause of mistake in this matter the case of one bear blind proper to be consider such a one might by touch attain to have ideas of upper and lower which modes of situation he would attribute only to things tangible he would not at first sight think anything he saw high or low erect or invert this illustrate by an example by what mean he would come to denominate visible object high or low etc why he should think those object highest which be paint on the lowest part of his eye and vice versa how he would perceive by sight the situation of external object our propension to think the contrary no argument against what have be say objection answer an object could not be know at first sight by the colour nor by the magnitude thereof nor by the figure in the first act of vision no tangible thing would be suggest by sight difficulty propose concern number number of things visible would not at first sight suggest the like number of things tangible number the creature of the mind one bear blind would not at first sight number visible things as others do the situation of any object determine with respect only to object of the same sense no distance great or small between a visible and tangible thing the not observe this cause of difficulty in erect vision which otherwise include nothing unaccountable what be mean by the picture be invert cause of mistake in this matter image in the eye not picture of external object in what sense they be picture in this affair we must carefully distinguish between ideas of sight and touch difficult to explain by word the true theory of vision the question whether there be any idea common to sight and touch state abstract extension inquire into it be incomprehensible abstract extension not the object of geometry the general idea of a triangle consider vacuum or pure space not common to sight and touch there be no idea or kind of idea common to both sense first argument in proof hereof second argument visible figure and extension not distinct ideas from colour third argument confirmation draw from mr molyneuxs problem of a sphere and a cube publish by mr locke which be falsely solve if the common supposition be true more might be say in proof of our tenet but this suffice further reflection on the forego problem the same thing doth not affect both sight and touch the same idea of motion not common to sight and touch the way wherein we apprehend motion by sight easily collect from what hath be say qu how visible and tangible ideas come to have the same name if not of the same kind this account for without suppose them of the same kind obj that a tangible square be liker to a visible square than to a visible circle ans that a visible square be fitter than a visible circle to represent a tangible square but it doth not hence follow that a visible square be like a tangible square why we be more apt to confound visible with tangible ideas than other sign with the things signify several other reason hereof assign reluctancy in reject any opinion no argument of its truth proper object of vision the language of nature in it there be much admirable and deserve our attention question propose concern the object of geometry at first view we be apt to think visible extension the object of geometry visible extension show not to be the object of geometry word may as well be think the object of geometry as visible extension it be propose to inquire what progress an intelligence that could see but not feel might make in geometry he can not understand those part which relate to solids and their surface and line generate by their section nor even the elements of plane geometry the proper object of sight incapable of be manage as geometrical figure the opinion of those who hold plane figure to be the immediate object of sight consider plan no more the immediate object of sight than solids difficult to enter precisely into the thoughts of the abovementioned intelligence the object of geometry its not be sufficiently understand cause of difficulty and useless labour in that science an essay towards a new theory of vision my design be to show the manner wherein we perceive by sight the distance magnitude and situation of object also to consider the difference there be betwixt the ideas of sight and touch and whether there be any idea common to both sense it be i think agree by all that distance of itself and immediately can not be see for distance be a line direct endwise to the eye it project only one point in the fund of the eye which point remain invariably the same whether the distance be longer or shorter i find it also acknowledge that the estimate we make of the distance of object considerably remote be rather an act of judgment ground on experience than of sense for example when i perceive a great number of intermediate object such as house field rivers and the like which i have experience to take up a considerable space i thence form a judgment or conclusion that the object i see beyond them be at a great distance again when an object appear faint and small which at a near distance i have experience to make a vigorous and large appearance i instantly conclude it to be far off and this it be evident be the result of experience without which from the faintness and littleness i should not have infer anything concern the distance of object but when an object be place at so near a distance as that the interval between the eye bear any sensible proportion to it the opinion of speculative men be that the two optic ax the fancy that we see only with one eye at once be explode concur at the object do there make an angle by mean of which accord as it be greater or lesser the object be perceive to be nearer or farther off betwixt which and the forego manner of estimate distance there be this remarkable difference that whereas there be no apparent necessary connection between small distance and a large and strong appearance or between great distance and a little and faint appearance there appear a very necessary connection between an obtuse angle and near distance and an acute angle and farther distance it do not in the least depend upon experience but may be evidently know by anyone before he have experience it that the nearer the concurrence of the optic ax the greater the angle and the remoter their concurrence be the lesser will be the angle comprehend by them there be another way mention by optic writers whereby they will have us judge of those distance in respect of which the breadth of the pupil hath any sensible bigness and that be the greater or lesser divergency of the ray which issue from the visible point do fall on the pupil that point be judge nearest which be see by most diverge ray and that remoter which be see by less diverge ray and so on the apparent distance still increase as the divergency of the ray decrease till at length it become infinite when the ray that fall on the pupil be to sense parallel and after this manner it be say we perceive distance when we look only with one eye in this case also it be plain we be not behold to experience it be a certain necessary truth that the nearer the direct ray fall on the eye approach to a parallelism the farther off be the point of their intersection or the visible point from whence they flow i have here set down the common current account that be give of our perceive near distance by sight which though they be unquestionably receive for true by mathematicians and accordingly make use of by them in determine the apparent place of object do nevertheless seem to me very unsatisfactory and that for these follow reason first it be evident that when the mind perceive any idea not immediately and of itself it must be by the mean of some other idea thus for instance the passions which be in the mind of another be of themselves to me invisible i may nevertheless perceive them by sight though not immediately yet by mean of the colour they produce in the countenance we often see shame or fear in the look of a man by perceive the change of his countenance to red or pale moreover it be evident that no idea which be not itself perceive can be the mean of perceive any other idea if i do not perceive the redness or paleness of a man face themselves it be impossible i should perceive by them the passions which be in his mind now from sect it be plain that distance be in its own nature imperceptible and yet it be perceive by sight it remain therefore that it be bring into view by mean of some other idea that be itself immediately perceive in the act of vision but those line and angle by mean whereof some mathematicians pretend to explain the perception of distance be themselves not at all perceive nor be they in truth ever think of by those unskilful in optics i appeal to anyones experience whether upon sight of an object he compute its distance by the bigness of the angle make by the meet of the two optic ax or whether he ever think of the greater or lesser divergency of the ray which arrive from any point to his pupil everyone be himself the best judge of what he perceive and what not in vain shall all the mathematicians in the world tell me that i perceive certain line and angle which introduce into my mind the various ideas of distance so long as i myself be conscious of no such thing since therefore those angle and line be not themselves perceive by sight it follow from sect that the mind doth not by them judge of the distance of object secondly the truth of this assertion will be yet farther evident to anyone that consider those line and angle have no real existence in nature be only an hypothesis frame by the mathematicians and by them introduce into optics that they might treat of that science in a geometrical way the third and last reason i shall give for reject that doctrine be that though we should grant the real existence of those optic angle etc and that it be possible for the mind to perceive them yet these principles would not be find sufficient to explain the phenomena of distance as shall be show hereafter now it be already show that distance be suggest to the mind by the mediation of some other idea which be itself perceive in the act of see it remain that we inquire what ideas or sensations there be that attend vision unto which we may suppose the ideas of distance be connect and by which they be introduce into the mind and first it be certain by experience that when we look at a near object with both eye accord as it approach or recede from us we alter the disposition of our eye by lessen or widen the interval between the pupils this disposition or turn of the eye be attend with a sensation which seem to me to be that which in this case bring the idea of greater or lesser distance into the mind not that there be any natural or necessary connection between the sensation we perceive by the turn of the eye and greater or lesser distance but because the mind have by constant experience find the different sensations correspond to the different dispositions of the eye to be attend each with a different degree of distance in the object there have grow an habitual or customary connection between those two sort of ideas so that the mind no sooner perceive the sensation arise from the different turn it give the eye in order to bring the pupils nearer or farther asunder but it withal perceive the different idea of distance which be wont to be connect with that sensation just as upon hear a certain sound the idea be immediately suggest to the understand which custom have unite with it nor do i see how i can easily be mistake in this matter i know evidently that distance be not perceive of itself that by consequence it must be perceive by mean of some other idea which be immediately perceive and vary with the different degrees of distance i know also that the sensation arise from the turn of the eye be of itself immediately perceive and various degrees thereof be connect with different distance which never fail to accompany them into my mind when i view an object distinctly with both eye whose distance be so small that in respect of it the interval between the eye have any considerable magnitude i know it be a receive opinion that by alter the disposition of the eye the mind perceive whether the angle of the optic ax be make greater or lesser and that accordingly by a kind of natural geometry it judge the point of their intersection to be nearer or farther off but that this be not true i be convince by my own experience since i be not conscious that i make any such use of the perception i have by the turn of my eye and for me to make those judgments and draw those conclusions from it without know that i do so seem altogether incomprehensible from all which it follow that the judgment we make of the distance of an object view with both eye be entirely the result of experience if we have not constantly find certain sensations arise from the various disposition of the eye attend with certain degrees of distance we should never make those sudden judgments from them concern the distance of object no more than we would pretend to judge a man thoughts by his pronounce word we have never hear before secondly an object place at a certain distance from the eye to which the breadth of the pupil bear a considerable proportion be make to approach be see more confusedly and the nearer it be bring the more confuse appearance it make and this be find constantly to be so there ariseth in the mind an habitual connection between the several degrees of confusion and distance the greater confusion still imply the lesser distance and the lesser confusion the greater distance of the object this confuse appearance of the object doth therefore seem to be the medium whereby the mind judgeth of distance in those case wherein the most approve writers of optics will have it judge by the different divergency with which the ray flow from the radiate point fall on the pupil no man i believe will pretend to see or feel those imaginary angle that the ray be suppose to form accord to their various inclinations on his eye but he can not choose see whether the object appear more or less confuse it be therefore a manifest consequence from what bath be demonstrate that instead of the greater or lesser divergency of the ray the mind make use of the greater or lesser confusedness of the appearance thereby to determine the apparent place of an object nor doth it avail to say there be not any necessary connection between confuse vision and distance great or small for i ask any man what necessary connection he see between the redness of a blush and shame and yet no sooner shall he behold that colour to arise in the face of another but it bring into his and the idea of that passion which hath be observe to accompany it what seem to have mislead the writers of optics in this matter be that they imagine men judge of distance as they do of a conclusion in mathematics betwixt which and the premise it be indeed absolutely requisite there be an apparent necessary connection but it be far otherwise in the sudden judgments men make of distance we be not to think that brutes and children or even grow reasonable men whenever they perceive an object to approach or depart from them do it by virtue of geometry and demonstration that one idea may suggest another to the mind it will suffice that they have be observe to go together without any demonstration of the necessity of their coexistence or without so much as know what it be that make them so to coexist of this there be innumerable instance of which no one can be ignorant thus greater confusion have be constantly attend with nearer distance no sooner be the former idea perceive but it suggest the latter to our thoughts and if it have be the ordinary course of nature that the farther off an object be place the more confuse it should appear it be certain the very same perception that now make us think an object approach would then have make us to imagine it go farther off that perception abstract from custom and experience be equally fit to produce the idea of great distance or small distance or no distance at all thirdly an object be place at the distance above specify and bring nearer to the eye we may nevertheless prevent at least for some time the appearances grow more confuse by strain the eye in which case that sensation supply the place of confuse vision in aid the mind to judge of the distance of the object it be esteem so much the nearer by how much the effort or strain of the eye in order to distinct vision be greater i have here set down those sensations or ideas that seem to be the constant and general occasion of introduce into the mind the different ideas of near distance it be true in most case that divers other circumstances contribute to frame our idea of distance to wit the particular number size kind etc of the things see concern which as well as all other the forementioned occasion which suggest distance i shall only observe they have none of them in their own nature any relation or connection with it nor be it possible they should ever signify the various degrees thereof otherwise than as by experience they have be find to be connect with them i shall proceed upon these principles to account for a phenomenon which have hitherto strangely puzzle the writers of optics and be so far from be account for by any of their theories of vision that it be by their own confession plainly repugnant to them and of consequence if nothing else could be object be alone sufficient to bring their credit in question the whole difficulty i shall lay before you in the word of the learn dr barrow with which he conclude his optic lecture i have here deliver what my thoughts have suggest to me concern that part of optics which be more properly mathematical as for the other part of that science which be rather physical do consequently abound with plausible conjecture instead of certain principles there have in them scarce anything occur to my observation different from what have be already say by kepler scheinerus descartes and others and methinks i have better say nothing at all than repeat that which have be so often say by others i think it therefore high time to take my leave of this subject but before i quit it for good and all the fair and ingenuous deal that i owe both to you and to truth obligeth me to acquaint you with a certain untoward difficulty which seem directly opposite to the doctrine i have be hitherto inculcate at least admit of no solution from it in short it be this before the double convex glass or concave speculum ebf let the point a be place at such a distance that the ray proceed from a after refraction or reflection be bring to unite somewhere in the axab and suppose the point of union ie the image of the point a as hath be already set forth to be z between which and b the vertex of the glass or speculum conceive the eye to be anywhere place the question now be where the point a ought to appear experience show that it do not appear behind at the point z and it be contrary to nature that it should since all the impression which affect the sense come from towards a but from our tenets it should seem to follow that it would appear before the eye at a vast distance off so great as should in some sort surpass all sensible distance for since if we exclude all anticipations and prejudice every object appear by so much the farther off by how much the ray it send to the eye be less diverge and that object be think to be most remote from which parallel ray proceed unto the eye reason would make one think that object should appear at yet a greater distance which be see by converge ray moreover it may in general be ask concern this case what it be that determine the apparent place of the point a and maketh it to appear after a constant manner sometimes nearer at other time farther off to which doubt i see nothing that can be answer agreeable to the principles we have lay down except only that the point a ought always to appear extremely remote but on the contrary we be assure by experience that the point a appear variously distant accord to the different situations of the eye between the point b and z and that it doth never if at all seem farther off than it would if it be behold by the naked eye but on the contrary it doth sometimes appear much nearer nay it be even certain that by how much the ray fall on the eye do more converge by so much the nearer doth the object seem to approach for the eye be place close to the point b the object a appear nearly in its own natural place if the point b be take in the glass or at the same distance if in the speculum the eye be bring back to o the object seem to draw near and be come to p it behold it still nearer and so on little and little till at length the eye be place somewhere suppose at q the object appear extremely near begin to vanish into mere confusion all which doth seem repugnant to our principles at least not rightly to agree with them nor be our tenet alone strike at by this experiment but likewise all others that ever come to my knowledge be every whit as much endanger by it the ancient one especially which be most commonly receive and come nearest to mine seem to be so effectually overthrow thereby that the most learn tacquet have be force to reject that principle as false and uncertain on which alone he have build almost his whole catoptrics and consequently by take away the foundation hath himself pull down the superstructure he have raise on it which nevertheless i do not believe he would have do have he but consider the whole matter more thoroughly and examine the difficulty to the bottom but as for me neither this nor any other difficulty shall have so great an influence on me as to make me renounce that which i know to be manifestly agreeable to reason especially when as it here fall out the difficulty be found in the peculiar nature of a certain odd and particular case for in the present case something peculiar lie hide which be involve in the subtilty of nature will perhaps hardly be discover till such time as the manner of vision be more perfectly make know concern which i must own i have hitherto be able to find out nothing that have the least show of probability not to mention certainty i shall therefore leave this knot to be untie by you wish you may have better success in it than i have have the ancient and receive principle which dr barrow here mention as the main foundation of tacquets catoptrics be that every visible point see by reflection from a speculum shall appear place at the intersection of the reflect ray and the perpendicular of incidence which intersection in the present case happen to be behind the eye it greatly shake the authority of that principle whereon the aforementioned author proceed throughout his whole catoptrics in determine the apparent place of object see by reflection from any kind of speculum let us now see how this phenomenon agree with our tenets the eye the nearer it be place to the point b in the forego figure the more distinct be the appearance of the object but as it recede to o the appearance grow more confuse and at p it see the object yet more confuse and so on till the eye be bring back to z see the object in the greatest confusion of all wherefore by sect the object should seem to approach the eye gradually as it recede from the point b that be at o it should in consequence of the principle i have lay down in the aforesaid section seem nearer than it do at b and at p nearer than at o and at q nearer than at p and so on till it quite vanish at z which be the very matter of fact as anyone that please may easily satisfy himself by experiment this case be much the same as if we should suppose an englishman to meet a foreigner who use the same word with the english but in a direct contrary signification the englishman would not fail to make a wrong judgment of the ideas annex to those sound in the mind of him that use them just so in the present case the object speak if i may so say with word that the eye be well acquaint with that be confusions of appearance but whereas heretofore the greater confusions be always wont to signify nearer distance they have in this case a direct contrary signification be connect with the greater distance whence it follow that the eye must unavoidably be mistake since it will take the confusions in the sense it have be use to which be directly oppose to the true this phenomenon as it entirely subvert the opinion of those who will have us judge of distance by line and angle on which supposition it be altogether inexplicable so it seem to me no small confirmation of the truth of that principle whereby it be explain but in order co a more full explication of this point and to show how far the hypothesis of the mind judge by the various divergency of ray may be of use in determine the apparent place of an object it will be necessary to premise some few things which be already well know to those who have any skill in dioptrics first any radiate point be then distinctly see when the ray proceed from it be by the refractive power of the crystalline accurately reunite in the retina or fund of the eye but if they be reunite either before they arrive at the retina or after they have pass it then there be confuse vision secondly suppose in the adjacent figure np represent an eye duly frame and retain its natural figure in fig the ray fall nearly parallel on the eye be by the crystalline ab refract so as their focus or point of union f fall exactly on the retina but if the ray fall sensibly diverge on the eye as in fig then their focus fall beyond the retina or if the ray be make to converge by the lens qs before they come at the eye as in fig their focus f will fall before the retina in which two last case it be evident from the forego section that the appearance of the point z be confuse and by how much the greater be the convergency or divergency of the ray fall on the pupil by so much the farther will the point of their reunion be from the retina either before or behind it and consequently the point z will appear by so much the more confuse and this by the bye may show us the difference between confuse and faint vision confuse vision be when the ray proceed from each distinct point of the object be not accurately recollect in one correspond point on the retina but take up some space thereon so that ray from different point become mix and confuse together this be oppose to a distinct vision and attend near object faint vision be when by reason of the distance of the object or grossness of the interjacent medium few ray arrive from the object to the eye this be oppose to vigorous or clear vision and attend remote object but to return the eye or to speak truly the mind perceive only the confusion itself without ever consider the cause from which it proceed doth constantly annex the same degree of distance to the same degree of confusion whether that confusion be occasion by converge or by diverge ray it matter not whence it follow that the eye view the object z through the glass qs which by refraction causeth the ray zq zs etc to converge should judge it to be at such a nearness at which if it be place it would radiate on the eye with ray diverge to that degree as would produce the same confusion which be now produce by converge ray ie would cover a portion of the retina equal to dc vid fig supra but then this must be understand to use dr barrows phrase seclusis praenotionibus et praejudiciis in case we abstract from all other circumstances of vision such as the figure size faintness etc of the visible object all which do ordinarily concur to form our idea of distance the mind have by frequent experience observe their several sort or degrees to be connect with various distance it plainly follow from what hath be say that a person perfectly purblind ie that could not see an object distinctly but when place close to his eye would not make the same wrong judgment that others do in the forementioned case for to him greater confusions constantly suggest greater distance he must as he recede from the glass and the object grow more confuse judge it to be at a farther distance contrary to what they do who have have the perception of the object grow more confuse connect with the idea of approach hence also it doth appear there may be good use of computation by line and angle in optics not that the mind judgeth of distance immediately by them but because it judgeth by somewhat which be connect with them and to the determination whereof they may be subservient thus the mind judge of the distance of an object by the confusedness of its appearance and this confusedness be greater or lesser to the naked eye accord as the object be see by ray more or less diverge it follow that a man may make use of the divergency of the ray in compute the apparent distance though not for its own sake yet on account of the confusion with which it be connect but so it be the confusion itself be entirely neglect by mathematicians as have no necessary relation with distance such as the greater or lesser angle of divergency be conceive to have and these especially for that they fall under mathematical computation be alone regard in determine the apparent place of object as though they be the sole and immediate cause of the judgments the mind make of distance whereas in truth they should not at all be regard in themselves or any otherwise than as they be suppose to be the cause of confuse vision the not consider of this have be a fundamental and perplex oversight for proof whereof we need go no farther than the case before us it have be observe that the most diverge ray bring into the mind the idea of nearest distance and that still as the divergency decrease the distance increase and it be think the connexion between the various degrees of divergency and distance be immediate this naturally lead one to conclude from an illgrounded analogy that converge ray shall make an object appear at an immense distance and that as the convergency increase the distance if it be possible should do so likewise that this be the cause of dr barrows mistake be evident from his own word which we have quote whereas have the learn doctor observe that diverge and converge ray how opposite soever they may seem do nevertheless agree in produce the same effect to wit confusedness of vision greater degrees whereof be produce indifferently either as the divergency or convergency and the ray increaseth and that it be by this effect which be the same in both that either the divergency or convergency be perceive by the eye i say have he but consider this it be certain he would have make a quite contrary judgment and rightly conclude that those ray which fall on the eye with greater degrees of convergency should make the object from whence they proceed appear by so much the nearer but it be plain it be impossible for any man to attain to a right notion of this matter so long as he have regard only to line and angle and do not apprehend the true nature of vision and how far it be of mathematical consideration before we dismiss this subject it be fit we take notice of a query relate thereto propose by the ingenious mr molyneux be his treatise of dioptricspar i prop sect where speak of this difficulty he have these word and so he ie dr barrow leave this difficulty to the solution of others which i after so great an example shall do likewise but with the resolution of the same admirable author of not quit the evident doarine which we have before lay down for determine the locus objecti on account of be press by one difficulty which seem inexplicable till a more intimate knowledge of the visive faculty be obtain by mortals in the meantime i propose it to the consideration of the ingenious whether the locus apparens of an object place as in this th section be not as much before the eye as the distinct base be behind the eye to which query we may venture to answer in the negative for in the present case the rule for determine the distance of the distinct base or respective focus from the glass be this as the difference between the distance of the object and focus be to the focus or focal length so the distance of the object from the glass be to the distance of the respective focus or distinct base from the glass molyneux dioptr par i prop let us now suppose the object to be place at the distance of the focal length and one half of the focal length from the glass and the eye close to the glass hence it will follow by the rule that the distance of the distinct base behind the eye be double the true distance of the object before the eye if therefore mr molyneuxs conjecture hold good it would follow that the eye should see the object twice as far off as it really be and in other case at three or four time its due distance or more but this manifestly contradict experience the object never appear at farthest beyond its due distance whatever therefore be build on this supposition vid corol i prop ibid come to the grind along with it from what hath be premise it be a manifest consequence that a man bear blind be make to see would at first have no idea of distance by sight the sun and star the remotest object as well as the nearer would all seem to be in his eye or rather in his mind the object intromit by sight would seem to him as in truth they be no other than a new set of thoughts or sensations each whereof be as near to him as the perceptions of pain or pleasure or the most inward passions of his soul for our judge object provide by sight to be at any distance or without the mind be vid sect entirely the effect of experience which one in those circumstances could not yet have attain to it be indeed otherwise upon the common supposition that men judge of distance by the angle of the optic ax just as one in the dark or a blindman by the angle comprehend by two stick one whereof he hold in each hand for if this be true it would follow that one blind from his birth be make to see should stand in need of no new experience in order to perceive distance by sight but that this be false have i think be sufficiently demonstrate and perhaps upon a strict inquiry we shall not find that even those who from their birth have grow up in a continue habit of see be irrecoverably prejudice on the other side to wit in think what they see to be at a distance from them for at this time it seem agree on all hand by those who have have any thoughts of that matter that colour which be the proper and immediate object of sight be not without the mind but then it will be say by sight we have also the ideas of extension and figure and motion all which may well be think without and at some distance from the mind though colour should not in answer to this i appeal to any man experience whether the visible extension of any object doth not appear as near to him as the colour of that object nay whether they do not both seem to be in the very same place be not the extension we see colour and be it possible for us so much as in think to separate and abstract colour from extension now where the extension be there surely be the figure and there the motion too i speak of those which be perceive by sight but for a fuller explication of this point and to show that the immediate object of sight be not so much as the ideas or resemblances of things place at a distance it be requisite that we look nearer into the matter and carefully observe what be mean in common discourse when one say that which he see be at a distance from him suppose for example that look at the moon i should say it be fifty or sixty semidiameters of the earth distant from me let us see what moon this be speak of it be plain it can not be the visible moon or anything like the visible moon or that which i see which be only a round luminous plane of about thirty visible point in diameter for in case i be carry from the place where i stand directly towards the moon it be manifest the object vary still as i go on and by the time that i be advance fifty or sixty semidiameters of the earth i shall be so far from be near a small round luminous flat that i shall perceive nothing like it this object have long since disappear and if i would recover it it must be by go back to the earth from whence i set out again suppose i perceive by sight the faint and obscure idea of something which i doubt whether it be a man or a tree or a tower but judge it to be at the distance of about a mile it be plain i can not mean that what i see be a mile off or that it be the image or liken of anything which be a mile off since that every step i take towards it the appearance alter and from be obscure small and faint grow clear large and vigorous and when i come to the miles end that which i saw first be quite lose neither do i find anything in the liken of it in these and the like instance the truth of the matter stand thus have of a long time experience certain ideas perceivable by touch as distance tangible figure and solidity to have be connect with certain ideas of sight i do upon perceive these ideas of sight forthwith conclude what tangible ideas be by the wonted ordinary course of nature like to follow look at an object i perceive a certain visible figure and colour with some degree of faintness and other circumstances which from what i have formerly observe determine me to think that if i advance forward so many pace or miles i shall be affect with such and such ideas of touch so that in truth and strictness of speech i neither see distance itself nor anything that i take to be at a distance i say neither distance nor things place at a distance be themselves or their ideas truly perceive by sight this i be persuade of as to what concern myself and i believe whoever will look narrowly into his own thoughts and examine what he mean by say he see this or that thing at a distance will agree with me that what he see only suggest to his understand that after have pass a certain distance to be measure by the motion of his body which be perceivable by touch he shall come to perceive such and such tangible ideas which have be usually connect with such and such visible ideas but that one might be deceive by these suggestions of sense and that there be no necessary connexion between visible and tangible ideas suggest by them we need go no farther than the next lookingglass or picture to be convince note that when i speak of tangible ideas i take the word idea for any the immediate object of sense or understand in which large signification it be commonly use by the moderns from what we have show it be a manifest consequence that the ideas of space outness and things place at a distance be not strictly speak the object of sight they be not otherwise perceive by the eye than by the ear sit in my study i hear a coach drive along the street i look through the casement and see it i walk out and enter into it thus common speech would incline one to think i hear saw and touch the same thing to wit the coach it be nevertheless certain the ideas intromit by each sense be widely different and distinct from each other but have be observe constantly to go together they be speak of as one and the same thing by the variation of the noise i perceive the different distance of the coach and know that it approach before i look out thus by the ear i perceive distance just after the same manner as i do by the eye i do not nevertheless say i hear distance in like manner as i say that i see it the ideas perceive by hear not be so apt to be confound with the ideas of touch as those of sight be so likewise a man be easily convince that body and external things be not properly the object of hear but only sound by the mediation whereof the idea of this or that body or distance be suggest to his thoughts but then one be with more difficulty bring to discern the difference there be betwixt the ideas of sight and touch though it be certain a man no more see and feel the same thing than he hear and feel the same thing one reason of which seem to be this it be think a great absurdity to imagine that one and the same thing should have any more than one extension and one figure but the extension and figure of a body be let into the mind two ways and that indifferently either by sight or touch it seem to follow that we see the same extension and the same figure which we feel but if we take a close and accurate view of things it must be acknowledge that we never see and feel one and the same object that which be see be one thing and that which be felt be another if the visible figure and extension be not the same with the tangible figure and extension we be not to infer that one and the same thing have divers extensions the true consequence be that the object of sight and touch be two distinct things it may perhaps require some think rightly to conceive this distinction and the difficulty seem not a little increase because the combination of visible ideas hath constantly the same name as the combination of tangible ideas wherewith it be connect which doth of necessity arise from the use and end of language in order therefore to treat accurately and unconfusedly of vision we must bear in mind that there be two sort of object apprehend by the eye the one primarily and immediately the other secondarily and by intervention of the former those of the first sort neither be nor appear to be without the mind or at any distance off they may indeed grow greater or smaller more confuse or more clear or more faint but they do not can not approach or recede from us whenever we say an object be at a distance whenever we say it draw near or go farther off we must always mean it of the latter sort which properly belong to the touch and be not so truly perceive as suggest by the eye in like manner as thoughts by the ear no sooner do we hear the word of a familiar language pronounce in our ears but the ideas correspond thereto present themselves to our mind in the very same instant the sound and the mean enter the understand so closely be they unite that it be not in our power to keep out the one except we exclude the other also we even act in all respect as if we hear the very thoughts themselves so likewise the secondary object or those which be only suggest by sight do often more strongly affect us and be more regard than the proper object of that sense along with which they enter into the mind and with which they have a far more strict connexion than ideas have with word hence it be we find it so difficult to discriminate between the immediate and mediate object of sight and be so prone to attribute to the former what belong only to the latter they be as it be most closely twist blend and incorporate together and the prejudice be confirm and rivet in our thoughts by a long tract of time by the use of language and want of reflexion however i believe anyone that shall attentively consider what we have already say and shall say upon this subject before we have do especially if he pursue it in his own thoughts may be able to deliver himself from that prejudice sure i be it be worth some attention to whoever would understand the true nature of vision i have now do with distance and proceed to show how it be that we perceive by sight the magnitude of object it be the opinion of some that we do it by angle or by angle in conjunction with distance but neither angle nor distance be perceivable by sight and the things we see be in truth at no distance from us it follow that as we have show line and angle not to be the medium the mind make use of in apprehend the apparent place so neither be they the medium whereby it apprehend the apparent magnitude of object it be well know that the same extension at a near distance shall subtend a greater angle and at a farther distance a lesser angle and by this principle we be tell the mind estimate the magnitude of an object compare the angle under which it be see with its distance and thence infer the magnitude thereof what incline men to this mistake beside the humour of make one see by geometry be that the same perceptions or ideas which suggest distance do also suggest magnitude but if we examine it we shall find they suggest the latter as immediately as the former i say they do not first suggest distance and then leave it to the judgment to use that as a medium whereby to collect the magnitude but they have as close and immediate a connexion with the magnitude as with the distance and suggest magnitude as independently of distance as they do distance independently of magnitude all which will be evident to whoever consider what hath be already say and what follow it hath be show there be two sort of object apprehend by sight each whereof hath its distinct magnitude or extension the one properly tangible ie to be perceive and measure by touch and not immediately fall under the sense of see the other properly and immediately visible by mediation of which the former be bring in view each of these magnitudes be greater or lesser accord as they contain in them more or fewer point they be make up of point or minimums for whatever may be say of extension in abstract it be certain sensible extension be not infinitely divisible there be a minimum tangibile and a minimum visibile beyond which sense can not perceive this everyones experience will inform him the magnitude of the object which exist without the mind and be at a distance continue always invariably the same but the visible object still change as you approach to or recede from the tangible object it hath no fix and determinate greatness whenever therefore we speak of the magnitude of anything for instance a tree or a house we must mean the tangible magnitude otherwise there can be nothing steady and free from ambiguity speak of it but though the tangible and visible magnitude in truth belong to two distinct object i shall nevertheless especially since those object be call by the same name and be observe to coexist to avoid tediousness and singularity of speech sometimes speak of them as belong to one and the same thing now in order to discover by what mean the magnitude of tangible object be perceive by sight i need only reflect on what pass in my own mind and observe what those things be which introduce the ideas of greater or lesser into my thoughts when i look on any object and these i find to be first the magnitude or extension of the visible object which be immediately perceive by sight be connect with that other which be tangible and place at a distance secondly the confusion or distinctness and thirdly the vigorousness or faintness of the aforesaid visible appearance ceteris paribus by how much the greater or lesser the visible object be by so much the greater or lesser do i conclude the tangible object to be but be the idea immediately perceive by sight never so large yet if it be withal confuse i judge the magnitude of the thing to be but small if it be distinct and clear i judge it greater and if it be faint i apprehend it to be yet greater what be here mean by confusion and faintness hath be explain in sect moreover the judgments we make of greatness do in like manner as those of distance depend on the disposition of the eye also on the figure number and situation of object and other circumstances that have be observe to attend great or small tangible magnitudes thus for instance the very same quantity of visible extension which in the figure of a tower doth suggest the idea of great magnitude shall in the figure of a man suggest the idea of much smaller magnitude that this be owe to the experience we have have of the usual bigness of a tower and a man no one i suppose need be tell it be also evident that confusion or faintness have no more a necessary connexion with little or great magnitude than they have with little or great distance as they suggest the latter so they suggest the former to our mind and by consequence if it be not for experience we should no more judge a faint or confuse appearance to be connect with great or little magnitude than we should that it be connect with great or little distance nor will it be find that great or small visible magnitude hath any necessary relation to great or small tangible magnitude so that the one may certainly be infer from the other but before we come to the proof of this it be fit we consider the difference there be betwixt the extension and figure which be the proper object of touch and that other which be term visible and how the former be principally though not immediately take notice of when we look at any object this have be before mention but we shall here inquire into the cause thereof we regard the object that environ us in proportion as they be adapt to benefit or injure our own body and thereby produce in our mind the sensation of pleasure or pain now body operate on our organs by an immediate application and the hurt or advantage arise therefrom depend altogether on the tangible and not at all on the visible qualities of any object this be a plain reason why those should be regard by us much more than these and for this end the visive sense seem to have be bestow on animals to wit that by the perception of visible ideas which in themselves be not capable of affect or any wise alter the frame of their body they may be able to foresee from the experience they have have what tangible ideas be connect with such and such visible ideas and damage or benefit which be like to ensue upon the application of their own body to this or that body which be at a distance which foresight how necessary it be to the preservation of an animal everyones experience can inform him hence it be that when we look at an object the tangible figure and extension thereof be principally attend to whilst there be small heed take of the visible figure and magnitude which though more immediately perceive do less concern us and be not fit to produce any alteration in our body that the matter of fact be true will be evident to anyone who consider that a man place at ten foot distance be think as great as if he be place at a distance only of five foot which be true not with relation to the visible but tangible greatness of the object the visible magnitude be far greater at one station than it be at the other inch feet etc be settle state lengths whereby we measure object and estimate their magnitude we say for example an object appear to be six inch or six foot long now that this can not be mean of visible inch etc be evident because a visible inch be itself no constant determinate magnitude and can not therefore serve to mark out and determine the magnitude of any other thing take an inch mark upon a ruler view it successively at the distance of half a foot a foot a foot and a half etc from the eye at each of which and at all the intermediate distance the inch shall have a different visible extension ie there shall be more or fewer point discern in it now i ask which of all these various extensions be that state determinate one that be agree on for a common measure of other magnitudes no reason can be assign why we should pitch on one more than another and except there be some invariable determinate extension fix on to be mark to the word inch it be plain it can be use to little purpose and to say a thing contain this or that number of inch shall imply no more than that it be extend without bring any particular idea of that extension into the mind farther an inch and a foot from different distance shall both exhibit the same visible magnitude and yet at the same time you shall say that one seem several time greater than the other from all which it be manifest that the judgments we make of the magnitude of object by sight be altogether in reference to their tangible extension whenever we say an object be great or small of this or that determinate measure i say it must be mean of the tangible and not the visible extension which though immediately perceive be nevertheless little take notice of now that there be no necessary connexion between these two distinct extensions be evident from hence because our eye might have be frame in such a manner as to be able to see nothing but what be less than the minimum tangibile in which case it be not impossible we might have perceive all the immediate object of sight the very same that we do now but unto those visible appearances there would not be connect those different tangible magnitudes that be now which show the judgments we make of the magnitude of things place at a distance from the various greatness of the immediate object of sight do not arise from any essential or necessary but only a customary tie which have be observe between them moreover it be not only certain that any idea of sight might not have be connect with this or that idea of touch which we now observe to accompany it but also that the greater visible magnitudes might have be connect with and introduce into our mind lesser tangible magnitudes and the lesser visible magnitudes greater tangible magnitudes nay that it actually be so we have daily experience that object which make a strong and large appearance not seem near so great as another the visible magnitude whereof be much less but more faint and the appearance upper or which be the same thing paint lower on the retina which faintness and situation suggest both greater magnitude and greater distance from which and from sect and it be manifest that as we do not perceive the magnitudes of object immediately by sight so neither do we perceive them by the mediation of anything which have a necessary connexion with them those ideas that now suggest unto us the various magnitudes of external object before we touch them might possibly have suggest no such thing or they might have signify them in a direct contrary manner so that the very same ideas on the perception whereof we judge an object to be small might as well have serve to make us conclude it great those ideas be in their own nature equally fit to bring into our mind the idea of small or great or no size at all of outward object just as the word of any language be in their own nature indifferent to signify this or that thing or nothing at all as we see distance so we see magnitude and we see both in the same way that we see shame or anger in the look of a man those passions be themselves invisible they be nevertheless let in by the eye along with colour and alterations of countenance which be the immediate object of vision and which signify them for no other reason than barely because they have be observe to accompany them without which experience we should no more have take blush for a sign of shame than of gladness we be nevertheless exceed prone to imagine those things which be perceive only by the mediation of others to be themselves the immediate object of sight or at least to have in their own nature a fitness to be suggest by them before ever they have be experience to coexist with them from which prejudice everyone perhaps will not find it easy to emancipate himself by any but the clearest convictions of reason and there be some ground to think that if there be one only invariable and universal languages in the world and that men be bear with the faculty of speak it it would be the opinion of many that the ideas of other mens mind be properly perceive by the ear or have at least a necessary and inseparable tie with the sound that be affix to them all which seem to arise from want of a due application of our discern faculty thereby to discriminate between the ideas that be in our understand and consider them apart from each other which would preserve us from confound those that be different and make us see what ideas do and what do not include or imply this or that other idea there be a celebrate phenomenon the solution whereof i shall attempt to give by the principles that have be lay down in reference to the manner wherein we apprehend by sight the magnitude of object the apparent magnitude of the moon when place in the horizon be much greater than when it be in the meridian though the angle under which the diameter of the moon be see be not observe greater in the former case than in the latter and the horizontal moon doth not constantly appear of the same bigness but at some time seemeth far greater than at others now in order to explain the reason of the moon appear greater than ordinary in the horizon it must be observe that the particles which compose our atmosphere intercept the ray of light proceed from any object to the eye and by how much the greater be the portion of atmosphere interjacent between the object and the eye by so much the more be the ray intercept and by consequence the appearance of the object render more faint every object appear more vigorous or more faint in proportion as it sendeth more or fewer ray into the eye now between the eye and the moon when situate in the horizon there lie a far greater quantity of atmosphere than there do when the moon be in the meridian whence it come to pass that the appearance of the horizontal moon be fainter and therefore by sect it should be think bigger in that situation than in the meridian or in any other elevation above the horizon farther the air be variously impregnate sometimes more and sometimes less with vapours and exhalations fit to retund and intercept the ray of light it follow that the appearance of the horizontal moon hath not always an equal faintness and by consequence that luminary though in the very same situation be at one time judge greater than at another that we have here give the true account of the phenomena of the horizontal moon will i suppose be farther evident to anyone from the follow considerations first it be plain that which in this case suggest the idea of greater magnitude must be something which be itself perceive for that which be unperceived can not suggest to our perception any other thing secondly it must be something that do not constantly remain the same but be subject to some change or variation since the appearance of the horizontal moon vary be at one time greater than at another and yet thirdly it can not be the visible figure or magnitude since that remain the same or be rather lesser by how much the moon be nearer to the horizon it remain therefore that the true cause be that affection or alteration of the visible appearance which proceed from the greater paucity of ray arrive at the eye and which i term faintness since this answer all the forementioned condition and i be not conscious of any other perception that doth add to this that in misty weather it be a common observation that the appearance of the horizontal moon be far larger than usual which greatly conspire with and strengthen our opinion neither would it prove in the least irreconcilable with what we have say if the horizontal moon should chance sometimes to seem enlarge beyond its usual extent even in more serene weather for we must not only have regard to the mist which happen to be in the place where we stand we ought also to take into our thoughts the whole sum of vapours and exhalations which lie betwixt the eye and the moon all which cooperate to render the appearance of the moon more faint and thereby increase its magnitude it may chance to appear greater than it usually do even in the horizontal position at a time when though there be no extraordinary fog or haziness just in the place where we stand yet the air between the eye and the moon take all together may be load with a greater quantity of intersperse vapours and exhalations than at other time it may be object that in consequence of our principles the interposition of a body in some degree opaque which may intercept a great part of the ray of light should render the appearance of the moon in the meridian as large as when it be view in the horizon to which i answer it be not faintness anyhow apply that suggest greater magnitude there be no necessary but only an experimental connexion between those two things it follow that the faintness which enlarge the appearance must be apply in such sort and with such circumstances as have be observe to attend the vision of great magnitudes when from a distance we behold great object the particles of the intermediate air and vapours which be themselves unperceivable do interrupt the ray of light and thereby render the appearance less strong and vivid now faintness of appearance cause in this sort hath be experience to coexist with great magnitude but when it be cause by the interposition of an opaque sensible body this circumstance alter the case so that a faint appearance this way cause doth not suggest greater magnitude because it hath not be experience to coexist with it faintness as well as all other ideas or perceptions which suggest magnitude or distance doth it in the same way that word suggest the notions to which they be annex now it be know a word pronounce with certain circumstances or in a certain context with other word hath not always the same import and signification that it hath when pronounce in some other circumstances or different context of word the very same visible appearance as to faintness and all other respect if place on high shall not suggest the same magnitude that it would if it be see at an equal distance on a level with the eye the reason whereof be that we be rarely accustom to view object at a great height our concern lie among things situate rather before than above us and accordingly our eye be not place on the top of our head but in such a position as be most convenient for us to see distant object stand in our way and this situation of them be a circumstance which usually attend the vision of distant object we may from hence account for what be commonly observe an object appear of different magnitude even with respect to its horizontal extension on the top of a steeple for example an hundred feet high to one stand below from what it would if place at an hundred feet distance on a level with his eye for it hath be show that the judgment we make on the magnitude of a thing depend not on the visible appearance alone but also on divers other circumstances any one of which be omit or vary may suffice to make some alteration in our judgment hence the circumstances of view a distant object in such a situation as be usual and suit with the ordinary posture of the head and eye be omit and instead thereof a different situation of the object which require a different posture of the head take place it be not to be wonder at if the magnitude be judge different but it will be demand why an high object should constantly appear less than an equidistant low object of the same dimension for so it be observe to be it may indeed be grant that the variation of some circumstances may vary the judgment make on the magnitude of high object which we be less use to look at but it do not hence appear why they should be judge less rather than greater i answer that in case the magnitude of distant object be suggest by the extent of their visible appearance alone and think proportional thereto it be certain they would then be judge much less than now they seem to be vide sect but several circumstances concur to form the judgment we make on the magnitude of distant object by mean of which they appear far larger than others whose visible appearance hath an equal or even greater extension it follow that upon the change or omission of any of those circumstances which be wont to attend the vision of distant object and so come to influence the judgments make on their magnitude they shall proportionably appear less than otherwise they would for any of those things that cause an object to be think greater than in proportion to its visible extension be either omit or apply without the usual circumstances the judgment depend more entirely on the visible extension and consequently the object must be judge less thus in the present case the situation of the thing see be different from what it usually be in those object we have occasion to view and whose magnitude we observe it follow that the very same object be an hundred feet high should seem less than if it be an hundred feet off on or nearly on a level with the eye what have be here set forth seem to me to have no small share in contribute to magnify the appearance of the horizontal moon and deserve not to be pass over in the explication of it if we attentively consider the phenomenon before us we shall find the not discern between the mediate and immediate object of sight to be the chief cause of the difficulty that occur in the explication of it the magnitude of the visible moon or that which be the proper and immediate object of vision be not greater when the moon be in the horizon than when it be in the meridian how come it therefore to seem greater in one situation than the other what be it can put this cheat on the understand it have no other perception of the moon than what it get by sight and that which be see be of the same extent i say the visible appearance hath the same or rather a less magnitude when the moon be view in the horizontal than when in the meridional position and yet it be esteem greater in the former than in the latter herein consist the difficulty which doth vanish and admit of a most easy solution if we consider that as the visible moon be not greater in the horizon than in the meridian so neither be it think to be so it hath be already show that in any act of vision the visible object absolutely or in itself be little take notice of the mind still carry its view from that to some tangible ideas which have be observe to be connect with it and by that mean come to be suggest by it so that when a thing be say to appear great or small or whatever estimate be make of the magnitude of any thing this be mean not of the visible but of the tangible object this duly consider it will be no hard matter to reconcile the seem contradiction there be that the moon should appear of a different bigness the visible magnitude thereof remain still the same for by sect the very same visible extension with a different faintness shall suggest a different tangible extension when therefore the horizontal moon be say to appear greater than the meridional moon this must be understand not of a greater visible extension but a of greater tangible or real extension which by reason of the more than ordinary faintness of the visible appearance be suggest to the mind along with it many attempt have be make by learn men to account for this appearance gassendus descartes hobbes and several others have employ their thoughts on that subject but how fruitless and unsatisfactory their endeavour have be be sufficiently show in the transactionsphil trans num p where you may see their several opinions at large set forth and confute not without some surprize at the gross blunder that ingenious men have be force into by endeavour to reconcile this appearance with the ordinary principles of optics since the write of which there hath be publish in the transactions numb p another paper relate to the same affair by the celebrate dr wallis wherein he attempt to account for that phenomenon which though it seem not to contain anything new or different from what have be say before by others i shall nevertheless consider in this place his opinion in short be this we judge not of the magnitude of an object by the visual angle alone but by the visual angle in conjunction with the distance hence though the angle remain the same or even become less yet if withal the distance seem to have be increase the object shall appear greater now one way whereby we estimate the distance of anything be by the number and extent of the intermediate object when therefore the moon be see in the horizon the variety of field house etc together with the large prospect of the wide extend land or sea that lie between the eye and the utmost limb of the horizon suggest unto the mind the idea of greater distance and consequently magnify the appearance and this accord to dr wallis be the true account of the extraordinary largeness attribute by the mind to the horizontal moon at a time when the angle subtend by its diameter be not one jot greater than it use to be with reference to this opinion not to repeat what hath be already say concern distance i shall only observe first that if the prospect of interjacent object be that which suggest the idea of farther distance and this idea of farther distance be the cause that bring into the mind the idea of greater magnitude it should hence follow that if one look at the horizontal moon from behind a wall it would appear no bigger than ordinary for in that case the wall interpose cut off all that prospect of sea and land etc which might otherwise increase the apparent distance and thereby the apparent magnitude of the moon nor will it suffice to say the memory doth even then suggest all that extent of land etc which lie within the horizon which suggestion occasion a sudden judgment of sense that the moon be farther off and larger than usual for ask any man who from such a station behold the horizontal moon shall think her greater than usual whether he hath at that time in his mind any idea of the intermediate object or long tract of land that lie between his eye and the extreme edge of the horizon and whether it be that idea which be the cause of his make the aforementioned judgment he will i suppose reply in the negative and declare the horizontal moon shall appear greater than the meridional though he never think of all or any of those things that lie between him and it secondly it seem impossible by this hypothesis to account for the moon appear in the very same situation at one time greater than at another which nevertheless have be show to be very agreeable to the principles we have lay down and receive a most easy and natural explication from them for the further clear up of this point it be to be observe that what we immediately and properly see be only light and colour in sundry situations and shade and degrees of faintness and clearness confusion and distinctness all which visible object be only in the mind nor do they suggest ought external whether distance or magnitude otherwise than by habitual connexion as word do things we be also to remark that beside the strain of the eye and beside the vivid and faint the distinct and confuse appearances which bear some proportion to line and angle have be substitute instead of them in the forego part of this treatise there be other mean which suggest both distance and magnitude particularly the situation of visible point of object as upper or lower the one suggest a farther distance and greater magnitude the other a nearer distance and lesser magnitude all which be an effect only of custom and experience there be really nothing intermediate in the line of distance between the uppermost and lowermost which be both equidistant or rather at no distance from the eye as there be also nothing in upper or lower which by necessary connexion should suggest greater or lesser magnitude now as these customary experimental mean of suggest distance do likewise suggest magnitude so they suggest the one as immediately as the other i say they do not vide sect first suggest distance and then leave the mind from thence to infer or compute magnitude jut suggest magnitude as immediately and directly as they suggest distance this phenomenon of the horizontal moon be a clear instance of the insufficiency of line and angle for explain the way wherein the mind perceive and estimate the magnitude of outward object there be nevertheless a use of computation by them in order to determine the apparent magnitude of things so far as they have a connexion with and be proportional to those other ideas or perceptions which be the true and immediate occasion that suggest to the mind the apparent magnitude of things but this in general may i think be observe concern mathematical computation in optics that it can never be very precise and exact since the judgments we make of the magnitude of external things do often depend on several circumstances which be not proportionable to or capable of be define by line and angle from what have be say we may safely deduce this consequence to wit that a man bear blind and make to see would at first open of his eye make a very different judgment of the magnitude of object intromit by them from what others do he would not consider the ideas of sight with reference to or as have any connexion with the ideas of touch his view of them be entirely terminate within themselves he can no otherwise judge them great or small than as they contain a greater or lesser number of visible point now it be certain that any visible point can cover or exclude from view only one other visible point it follow that whatever object intercept the view of another hath an equal number of visible point with it and consequently they shall both be think by him to have the same magnitude hence it be evident one in those circumstances would judge his thumb with which he might hide a tower or hinder its be see equal to that tower or his hand the interposition whereof might conceal experimental mean the firmament from his view equal to the firmament how great an inequality soever there may in our apprehensions seem to be betwixt those two things because of the customary and close connexion that have grow up in our mind between the object of sight and touch whereby the very different and distinct ideas of those two sense be so blend and confound together as to be mistake for one and the same thing out of which prejudice we can not easily extricate ourselves for the better explain the nature of vision and set the manner wherein we perceive magnitudes in a due light i shall proceed to make some observations concern matter relate thereto whereof the want of reflexion and duly separate between tangible and visible ideas be apt to create in us mistake and confuse notions and first i shall observe that the minimum visibile be exactly equal in all be whatsoever that be endow with the visive faculty no exquisite formation of the eye no peculiar sharpness of sight can make it less in one creature than in another for it not be distinguishable into part nor in any wise a consist of them it must necessarily be the same to all for suppose it otherwise and that the minimum visibile of a mite for instance be less than the minimum visibile of a man the latter therefore may by detraction of some part be make equal to the former it doth therefore consist of part which be inconsistent with the notion of a minimum visibile or point it will perhaps be object that the minimum visibile of a man doth really and in itself contain part whereby it surpass that of a mite though they be not perceivable by the man to which i answer the minimum visibile have in like manner as all other the proper and immediate object of sight be show not to have any existence without the mind of him who see it it follow there can not be any pan of it that be not actually perceive and therefore visible now for any object to contain distinct visible part and at the same time to be a minimum visibile be a manifest contradiction of these visible point we see at all time an equal number it be every whit as great when our view be contract and bound by near object as when it be extend to larger and remoter for it be impossible that one minimum visibile should obscure or keep out of sight mote than one other it be a plain consequence that when my view be on all side bound by the wall of my study see just as many visible point as i could in case that by the removal of the studywalls and all other obstructions i have a full prospect of the circumjacent field mountains sea and open firmament for so long as i be shut up within the wall by their interposition every point of the external object be cover from my view but each point that be see be able to cover or exclude from sight one only other correspond point it follow that whilst my sight be confine to those narrow wall i see as many point or minima visibilia as i should be those wall away by look on all the external object whose prospect be intercept by them whenever therefore we be say to have a greater prospect at one time than another this must be understand with relation not to the proper and immediate but the secondary and mediate object of vision which as hath be show properly belong to the touch the visive faculty consider with reference to its immediate object may be find to labour of two defect first in respect of the extent or number of visible point that be at once perceivable by it which be narrow and limit to a certain degree it can take in at one view but a certain determinate number of minima visibilia beyond which it can not extend its prospect secondly our sight be defective in that its view be not only narrow but also for the most part confuse of those things that we take in at one prospect we can see but a few at once clearly and unconfusedly and the more we fix our sight on any one object by so much the darker and more indistinct shall the rest appear correspond to these two defect of sight we may imagine as many perfections to wit st that of comprehend in one view a greater number of visible point dly of be able to view them all equally and at once with the utmost clearness and distinction that those perfections be not actually in some intelligences of a different order and capacity from ours it be impossible for us to know in neither of those two ways do microscopes contribute to the improvement of sight for when we look through a microscope we neither see more visible point nor be the collateral point more distinct than when we look with the naked eye at object place in a due distance a microscope bring us as it be into a new world it present us with a new scene of visible object quite different from what we behold with the naked eye but herein consist the most remarkable difference to wit that whereas the object perceive by the eye alone have a certain connexion with tangible object whereby we be teach to foresee what will ensue upon the approach or application of distant object to the part of our own body which much conduceth to its preservation there be not the like connexion between things tangible and those visible object that be perceive by help of a fine microscope hence it be evident that be our eye turn into the nature of microscopes we should not be much benefit by the change we should be deprive of the forementioned advantage we at present receive by the visive faculty and have leave us only the empty amusement of see without any other benefit arise from it but in that case it will perhaps be say our sight would be endue with a far greater sharpness and penetration than it now hath but it be certain from what we have already show that the minimum visibile be never greater or lesser but in all case constantly the same and in the case of microscopical eye i see only this difference to wit that upon the cease of a certain observable connexion betwixt the divers perceptions of sight and touch which before enable us to regulate our action by the eye it would now be render utterly unserviceable to that purpose upon the whole it seem that if we consider the use and end of sight together with the present state and circumstances of our be we shall not find any great cause to complain of any defect or imperfection in it or easily conceive how it could be mend with such admirable wisdom be that faculty contrive both for the pleasure and convenience of life have finish what i intend to say concern the distance and magnitude of object i come now to treat of the manner wherein the mind perceive by sight their situation among the discoveries of the last age it be repute none of the least that the manner of vision hath be more clearly explain than ever it have be before there be at this day no one ignorant that the picture of external object be paint on the retina or fund of the eye that we can see nothing which be not so paint and that accord as the picture be more distinct or confuse so also be the perception we have of the object but then in this explication of vision there occur one mighty difficulty the object be paint in an invert order on the bottom of the eye the upper part of any object be paint on the lower part of the eye and the lower part of the object on the upper part of the eye and so also as to right and leave since therefore the picture be thus invert it be demand how it come to pass that we see the object erect and in their natural posture in answer to this difficulty we be tell that the mind perceive an impulse of a ray of light on the upper part of the eye consider this ray as come in a direct line from the lower part of the object and in like manner trace the ray that strike on the lower part of the eye it be direct to the upper part of the object thus in the adjacent figure c the lower point of the object abc be project on c the upper part of the eye so likewise the highest point a be project on a the lowest part of the eye which make the representation cba invert but the mind consider the stroke that be make on c as come in the straight line cc from the lower end of the object and the stroke or impulse on a as come in the line aa from the upper end of the object be direct to make a right judgment of the situation of the object abc notwithstanding the picture of it be invert this be illustrate by conceive a blind man who hold in his hand two stick that cross each other doth with them touch the extremities of an object place in a perpendicular situation it be certain this man will judge that to be the upper part of the object which he touch with the stick hold in the undermost hand and that to be the lower part of the object which he touch with the stick in his uppermost hand this be the common explication of the erect appearance of object which be generally receive and acquiesce in be as mr molyneux tell us diopt par c p allow by all men as satisfactory but this account to me do not seem in any degree true do i perceive those impulses decussations and directions of the ray of light in like manner as hath be set forth then indeed it would not be altogether void of probability and there might be some pretence for the comparison of the blind man and his cross stick but the case be far otherwise i know very well that i perceive no such thing and of consequence i can not thereby make an estimate of the situation of object i appeal to anyones experience whether he be conscious to himself that he think on the intersection make by the radious sic pencil or pursue the impulses they give in right line whenever he perceive by sight the position of any object to me it seem evident that cross and trace of the ray be never think on by children idiots or in truth by any other save only those who have apply themselves to the study of optics and for the mind to judge of the situation of object by those things without perceive them or to perceive them without know it be equally beyond my comprehension add to this that the explain the manner of vision by the example of cross stick and hunt for the object along the ax of the radious pencil doth suppose the proper object of sight to be perceive at a distance from us contrary to what hath be demonstrate it remain therefore that we look for some other explication of this difficulty and i believe it not impossible to find one provide we examine it to the bottom and carefully distinguish between the ideas of sight and touch which can not be too oft inculcate in treat of vision but more especially throughout the consideration of this affair we ought to carry that distinction in our thoughts for that from want of a right understand thereof the difficulty of explain erect vision seem chiefly to arise in order to disentangle our mind from whatever prejudice we may entertain with relation to the subject in hand nothing seem more apposite than the take into our thoughts the case of one bear blind and afterwards when grow up make to see and though perhaps it may not be an easy task to divest ourselves entirely of the experience receive from sight so as to be able to put our thoughts exactly in the posture of such a ones we must nevertheless as far as possible endeavour to frame true conceptions of what might reasonably be suppose to pass in his mind it be certain that a man actually blind and who have continue so from his birth would by the sense of feel attain to have ideas of upper and lower by the motion of his hand he might discern the situation of any tangible object place within his fi reach that part on which he felt himself support or towards which he perceive his body to gravitate he would term lower and the contrary to this upper and accordingly denominate whatsoever object he touch but then whatever judgments he make concern the situation of object be confine to those only that be perceivable by touch all those things that be intangible and of a spiritual nature his thoughts and desire his passions and in general all the modifications of the soul to these he would never apply the term upper and lower except only in a metaphorical sense he may perhaps by way of allusion speak of high or low thoughts but those term in their proper signification would never be apply to anything that be not conceive to exist without the mind for a man bear blind and remain in the same state could mean nothing else by the word higher and lower than a greater or lesser distance from the earth which distance he would measure by the motion or application of his hand or some other part of his body it be therefore evident that all those things which in respect of each other would by him be think higher or lower must be such as be conceive to exist without his mind in the ambient space whence it plainly follow that such a one if we suppose him make to see would not at first sight think anything he saw be high or low erect or invert for it hath be already demonstrate in sect that he would not think the things he perceive by sight to be at any distance from him or without his mind the object to which he have hitherto be use to apply the term up and down high and low be such only as affect or be some way perceive by his couch but the proper object of vision make a new set of ideas perfectly distinct and different from the former and which can in no sort make themselves perceive by touch there be therefore nothing at all that could induce him to think those term applicable to them nor would he ever think it till such time as he have observe their connexion with tangible object and the same prejudice begin to insinuate itself into his understand which from their infancy have grow up in the understand of other men to set this matter in a clearer light i shall make use of an example suppose the abovementioned blind person by his touch perceive a man to stand erect let us inquire into the manner of this by the application of his hand to the several part of a human body he have perceive different tangible ideas which be collect into sundry complex ones have distinct name annex to them thus one combination of a certain tangible figure bulk and consistency of part be call the head another the hand a third the foot and so of the rest all which complex ideas could in his understand be make up only of ideas perceivable by touch he have also by his touch obtain an idea of earth or grind towards which he perceive the part of his body to have a natural tendency now by erect nothing more be mean than that perpendicular position of a man wherein his feet be nearest to the earth if the blind person by move his hand over the part of the man who stand before him perceive the tangible ideas that compose the head to be farthest from and those that compose the feet to be nearest to that other combination of tangible ideas which he call earth he will denominate that man erect but if we suppose him on a sudden to receive his sight and that he behold a man stand before him it be evident in that case he would neither judge the man he see to be erect nor invert for he never have know those term apply to any other save tangible things or which exist in the space without him and what he see neither be tangible nor perceive as exist without he could not know that in propriety of language they be applicable to it afterwards when upon turn his head or eye up and down to the right and leave he shall observe the visible object to change and shall also attain to know that they be call by the same name and connect with the object perceive by touch then indeed he will come to speak of them and their situation in the same term that he have be use to apply to tangible things and those that he perceive by turn up his eye he will call upper and those that by turn down his eye he will call lower and this seem to me the true reason why he should think those object uppermost that be paint on the lower part of his eye for by turn the eye up they shall be distinctly see as likewise those that be paint on the highest part of the eye shall be distinctly see by turn the eye down and be for that reason esteem lowest for we have show that to the immediate object of sight consider in themselves he would not attribute the term high and low it must therefore be on account of some circumstances which be observe to attend them and these it be plain be the action of turn the eye up and down which suggest a very obvious reason why the mind should denominate the object of sight accordingly high or low and without this motion of the eye this turn it up and down in order to discern different object doubtless erect inverse and other the like term relate to the position of tangible object would never have be transfer or in any degree apprehend to belong to the ideas of sight the mere act of see include nothing in it to that purpose whereas the different situations of the eye naturally direct the mind to make a suitable judgment of the situation of object intromit by it farther when he have by experience learn the connexion there be between the several ideas of sight and touch he will be able by the perception he have of the situation of visible things in respect of one another to make a sudden and true estimate of the situation of outward tangible things correspond to them and thus it be he shall perceive by sight the situation of external object which do not properly fall under that sense i know we be very prone to think that if just make to see we should judge of the situation of visible things as we do now but we be also as prone to think that at first sight we should in the same way apprehend the distance and magnitude of object as we do now which hath be show to be a false and groundless persuasion and for the like reason the same censure may be pass on the positive assurance that most men before they have think sufficiently of the matter might have of their be able to determine by the eye at first view whether object be erect or inverse it will perhaps be object co our opinion that a man for instance be think erect when his feet be next the earth and invert when his head be next the earth it doth hence follow that by the mere act of vision without any experience or alter the situation of the eye we should have determine whether he be erect or invert for both the earth itself and the limbs of the man who stand thereon be equally perceive by sight one can not choose see what part of the man be nearest the earth and what part farthest from it ie whether he be erect or invert to which i answer the ideas which constitute the tangible earth and man be entirely different from those which constitute the visible earth and man nor be it possible by virtue of the visive faculty alone without superadding any experience of touch or alter the position of the eye ever to have know or so much as suspect there have be any relation or connexion between them hence a man at first view would not denominate anything he saw earth or head or foot and consequently he could not tell by the mere act of vision whether the head or feet be nearest the earth nor indeed would we have thereby any think of earth or man erect or inverse at all which will be make yet more evident if we nicely observe and make a particular comparison between the ideas of both sense that which i see be only variety of light and colour that which i feel be hard or soft hot or cold rough or smooth what similitude what connexion have those ideas with these or how be it possible that anyone should see reason to give one and the same name to combinations of ideas so very different before he have experience their coexistence we do not find there be any necessary connexion betwixt this or that tangible quality and any colour whatsoever and we may sometimes perceive colour where there be nothing to be felt all which doth make it manifest that no man at first receive of his sight would know there be any agreement between this or that particular object of his sight and any object of touch he have be already acquaint with the colour therefore of the head would to him no more suggest the idea of head than they would the idea of foot farther we have at large show vid sect and there be no discoverable necessary connexion between any give visible magnitude and any one particular tangible magnitude but that it be entirely the result of custom and experience and depend on foreign and accidental circumstances that we can by the perception of visible extension inform ourselves what may be the extension of any tangible object connect with it hence it be certain that neither the visible magnitude of head or foot would bring along with them into the mind at first open of the eye the respective tangible magnitudes of those part by the forego section it be plain the visible figure of any part of the body hath no necessary connexion with the tangible figure thereof so as at first sight to suggest it to the mind for figure be the termination of magnitude whence it follow that no visible magnitude have in its own nature an aptness to suggest any one particular tangible magnitude so neither can any visible figure be inseparably connect with its correspond tangible figure so as of itself and in a way prior to experience it might suggest it to the understand this will be farther evident if we consider that what seem smooth and round to the touch may to sight if view through a microscope seem quite otherwise from all which lay together and duly consider we may clearly deduce this inference in the first act of vision no idea enter by the eye would have a perceivable connexion with the ideas to which the name earth man head foot etc be annex in the understand of a person blind from his birth so as in any sort to introduce them into his mind or make themselves be call by the same name and repute the same things with them as afterwards they come to be there doth nevertheless remain one difficulty which perhaps may seem to press hard on our opinion and deserve not to be pass over for though it be grant that neither the colour size nor figure of the visible feet have any necessary connexion with the ideas that compose the tangible feet so as to bring them at first sight into my mind or make me in danger of confound them before i have be use to and for some time experience their connexion yet thus much seem undeniable namely that the number of the visible feet be the same with that of the tangible feet i may from hence without any experience of sight reasonably conclude that they represent or be connect with the feet rather than the head i say it seem the idea of two visible feet will sooner suggest to the mind the idea of two tangible feet than of one head so that the blind man upon first reception of the visive faculty might know which be the feet or two and which the head or one in order to get clear of this seem difficulty we need only observe that diversity of visible object doth not necessarily infer diversity of tangible object correspond to them a picture paint with great variety of colour affect the touch in one uniform manner it be therefore evident that i do not by any necessary consecution independent of experience judge of the number of things tangible from the number of things visible i should not therefore at first open my eye conclude that because i see two i shall feel two how therefore can i before experience teach me know that the visible legs because two be connect with the tangible legs or the visible head because one be connect with the tangible head the truth be the things i see be so very different and heterogeneous from the things i feel that the perception of the one would never have suggest the other to my thoughts or enable me to pass the least judgment thereon until i have experience their connexion but for a fuller illustration of this matter it ought to be consider that number however some may reckon it amongst the primary qualities be nothing fix and settle really exist in things themselves it be entirely the creature of the mind consider either an idea by itself or any combination of ideas to which it give one name and so make it pass for an unit accord as the mind variously combine its ideas the unit vary and as the unit so the number which be only a collection of units doth also vary we call a window one a chimney one and yet a house in which there be many windows and many chimneys hath an equal right to be call one and many house go to the make of the city in these and the like instance it be evident the unit constantly relate to the particular draught the mind make of its ideas to which it affix name and wherein it include more or less as best suit its own end and purpose whatever therefore the mind consider as one that be an unit every combination of ideas be consider as one thing by the mind and in token thereof be mark by one name now this name and combine together of ideas be perfectly arbitrary and do by the mind in such sort as experience show it to be most convenient without which our ideas have never be collect into such sundry distinct combinations as they now be hence it follow that a man bear blind and afterwards when grow up make to see would not in the first act of vision parcel out the ideas of sight into the same distinct collections that others do who have experience which do regularly coexist and be proper to be bundle up together under one name he would not for example make into one complex idea and thereby esteem an unit all those particular ideas which constitute the visible head or foot for there can be no reason assign why he should do so barely upon his see a man stand upright before him there crowd into his mind the ideas which compose the visible man in company with all the other ideas of sight perceive at the same time but all these ideas offer at once to his view he would not distribute into sundry distinct combinations till such time as by observe the motion of the part of the man and other experience he come to know which be to be separate and which to be collect together from what hath be premise it be plain the object of sight and touch make if i may so say two set of ideas which be widely different from each other to object of either kind we indifferently attribute the term high and low right and leave and suchlike denote the position or situation of things but then we must well observe that the position of any object be determine with respect only to object of the same sense we say any object of touch be high or low accord as it be more or less distant from the tangible earth and in like manner we denominate any object of sight high or low in proportion as it be more or less distant from the visible earth but to define the situation of visible things with relation to the distance they bear from any tangible thing or vice versa this be absurd and perfectly unintelligible for all visible things be equally in the mind and take up no part of the external space and consequently be equidistant from any tangible thing which exist without the mind or rather to speak truly the proper object of sight be at no distance neither near nor far from any tangible thing for if we inquire narrowly into the matter we shall find that those things only be compare together in respect of distance which exist after the same manner or appertain unto the same sense for by the distance between any two point nothing more be mean than the number of intermediate point if the give point be visible the distance between them be mark out by the number of the interjacent visible point if they be tangible the distance between them be a line consist of tangible point but if they be one tangible and the other visible the distance between them doth neither consist of point perceivable by sight nor by touch ie it be utterly inconceivable this perhaps will not find an easy admission into all mens understand however i should gladly be inform whether it be not true by anyone who will be at the pain to reflect a little and apply it home to his thoughts the not observe what have be deliver in the two last section seem to have occasion no small part of the difficulty that occur in the business of erect appearances the head which be paint nearest the earth seem to be farthest from it and on the other hand the feet which be paint farthest from the earth be think nearest to it herein lie the difficulty which vanish if we express the thing more clearly and free from ambiguity thus how come it that to the eye the visible head which be nearest the tangible earth seem farthest from the earth and the visible feet which be farthest from the tangible earth seem nearest the earth the question be thus propose who see not the difficulty be found on a supposition that the eye or visive faculty or rather the soul by mean thereof should judge of the situation of visible object with reference to their distance from the tangible earth whereas it be evident the tangible earth be not perceive by sight and it hath be show in the two last precede section that the location of visible object be determine only by the distance they bear from one another and that it be nonsense to talk of distance far or near between a visible and tangible thing if we confine our thoughts to the proper object of sight the whole be plain and easy the head be paint farthest from and the feet nearest to the visible earth and so they appear to be what be there strange or unaccountable in this let us suppose the picture in the fund of the eye to be the immediate object of the sight the consequence be that things should appear in the same posture they be paint in and be it not so the head which be see seem farthest from the earth which be see and the feet which be see seem nearest to the earth which be see and just so they be paint but say you the picture of the man be invert and yet the appearance be erect i ask what mean you by the picture of the man or which be the same thing the visible man be invert you tell me it be invert because the heel be uppermost and the head undermost explain me this you say that by the head be undermost you mean that it be nearest to the earth and by the heel be uppermost that they be farthest from the earth i ask again what earth you mean you can not mean the earth that be paint on the eye or the visible earth for the picture of the head be farthest from the picture of the earth and the picture of the feet nearest to the picture of the earth and accordingly the visible head be farthest from the visible earth and the visible feet nearest to it it remain therefore that you mean the tangible earth and so determine the situation of visible things with respect to tangible things contrary to what hath be demonstrate in sect and the two distinct provinces of sight and touch should be consider apart and as if their object have no intercourse no manner of relation one to another in point of distance or position farther what greatly contribute to make us mistake in this matter be that when we think of the picture in the fund of the eye we imagine ourselves look on the fund of anothers eye or another look on the fund of our own eye and behold the picture paint thereon suppose two eye a and b a from some distance look on the picture in b see them invert and for that reason conclude they be invert in b but this be wrong there be project in little on the bottom of a the image of the picture of suppose man earth etc which be paint on b and besides these the eye b itself and the object which environ it together with another earth be project in a larger size on a now by the eye a these larger image be deem the true object and the lesser only picture in miniature and it be with respect to those greater image that it determine the situation of the smaller image so that compare the little man with the great earth a judge him invert or that the feet be farthest from and the head nearest to the great earth whereas if a compare the little man with the little earth then he will appear erect ie his head shall seem farthest from and his feet nearest to the little earth but we must consider that b do not see two earth as a do it see only what be represent by the little picture in a and consequently shall judge the man erect for in truth the man in b be not invert for there the feet be next the earth but it be the representation of it in a which be invert for there the head of the representation of the picture of the man in b be next the earth and the feet farthest from the earth mean the earth which be without the representation of the picture in b for if you take the little image of the picture in b and consider them by themselves and with respect only to one another they be all erect and in their natural posture farther there lie a mistake in our imagine that the picture of external object be paint on the bottom of the eye it hath be show there be no resemblance between the ideas of sight and things tangible it hath likewise be demonstrate that the proper object of sight do not exist without the mind whence it clearly follow that the picture paint on the bottom of the eye be not the picture of external object let anyone consult his own thoughts and then say what affinity what liken there be between that certain variety and disposition of colour which constitute the visible man or picture of a man and that other combination of far different ideas sensible by touch which compose the tangible man but if this be the case how come they to be account picture or image since that suppose them to copy or represent some originals or other to which i answer in the forementioned instance the eye a take the little image include within the representation of the other eye b to be picture or copy whereof the archetypes be not things exist without but the larger picture project on its own fund and which by a be not think picture but the originals or true things themselves though if we suppose a third eye c from a due distance to behold the fund of a then indeed the things project thereon shall to c seem picture or image in the same sense that those project on b do to a rightly to conceive this point we must carefully distinguish between the ideas of sight and touch between the visible and tangible eye for certainly on the tangible eye nothing either be or seem to be paint again the visible eye as well as all other visible object hath be show to exist only in the mind which perceive its own ideas and compare them together call some picture in respect of others what hath be say be rightly comprehend and lay together doth i think afford a full and genuine explication of the erect appearance of object which phenomenon i must confess i do not see how it can be explain by any theories of vision hitherto make public in treat of these things the use of language be apt to occasion some obscurity and confusion and create in us wrong ideas for language be accommodate to the common notions and prejudice of men it be scarce possible to deliver the naked and precise truth without great circumlocution impropriety and to an unwary reader seem contradictions i do therefore once for all desire whoever shall think it worth his while to understand what i have write concern vision that he would not stick in this or that phrase or manner of expression but candidly collect my mean from the whole sum and tenor of my discourse and lay aside the word as much as possible consider the bare notions themselves and then judge whether they be agreeable to truth and his own experience or no we have show the way wherein the mind by mediation of visible ideas doth perceive or apprehend the distance magnitude and situation of tangible object we come now to inquire more particularly concern the difference between the ideas of sight and touch which be call by the same name and see whether there be any idea common to both sense from what we have at large set forth and demonstrate in the forego part of this treatise it be plain there be no one selfsame numerical extension perceive both by sight and touch but that the particular figure and extensions perceive by sight however they may be call by the same name and repute the same things with those perceive by touch be nevertheless different and have an existence distinct and separate from them so that the question be not now concern the same numerical ideas but whether there be any one and the same sort of species of ideas equally perceivable to both sense or in other word whether extension figure and motion perceive by sight be not specifically distinct from extension figure and motion perceive by touch but before i come more particularly to discuss this matter i find it proper to consider extension in abstract for of this there be much talk and i be apt to think that when men speak of extension as be an idea common to two sense it be with a secret supposition that we can single out extension from all other tangible and visible qualities and form thereof an abstract idea which idea they will have common both to sight and touch we be therefore to understand by extension in abstract an idea of extension for instance a line or surface entirely strip of all other sensible qualities and circumstances that might determine it to any particular existence it be neither black nor white nor red nor hath it any colour at all or any tangible quality whatsoever and consequently it be of no finite determinate magnitude for that which bound or distinguish one extension from another be some quality or circumstance wherein they disagree now i do not find that i can perceive imagine or any wise frame in my mind such an abstract idea as be here speak of a line or surface which be neither black nor white nor blue nor yellow etc nor long nor short nor rough nor smooth nor square nor round etc be perfectly incomprehensible this i be sure of as to myself how far the faculties of other men may reach they best can tell it be commonly say that the object of geometry be abstract extension but geometry contemplate figure now figure be the termination of magnitude but we have show that extension in abstract hath no finite determinate magnitude whence it clearly follow that it can have no figure and consequently be not the object of geometry it be indeed a tenet as well of the modern as of the ancient philosophers that all general truths be concern universal abstract ideas without which we be tell there could be no science no demonstration of any general proposition in geometry but it be no hard matter do i think it necessary to my present purpose to show that proposition and demonstrations in geometry might be universal though they who make them never think of abstract general ideas of triangles or circle after reiterate endeavour to apprehend the general idea a triangle i have find it altogether incomprehensible and surely if anyone be able to introduce that idea into my mind it must be the author of the essay concern human understand he who have so far distinguish himself from the generality of writers by the clearness and significancy of what he say let us therefore see how this celebrate author describe the general or abstract idea of a triangle it must be say he neither oblique nor rectangular neither equilateral equicrural nor scalenum but all and none of these at once in effect it be somewhat imperfect that can not exist an idea wherein some part of several different and inconsistent ideas be put together essay on hum understand b iv c s this be the idea which he think needful for the enlargement of knowledge which be the subject of mathematical demonstration and without which we could never come to know any general proposition concern triangles that author acknowledge it doth require some pain and skill to form this general idea of a triangle ibid but have he call to mind what he say in another place to wit that ideas of mix modes wherein any inconsistent ideas be put together can not so much as exist in the mind ie be conceive vid b iii c s ibid i say have this occur to his thoughts it be not improbable he would have own it above all the pain and skill he be master of to form the abovementioned idea of a triangle which be make up of manifest star contradictions that a man who lay so great a stress on clear and determinate ideas should nevertheless talk at this rate seem very surprise but the wonder will lessen if it be consider that the source whence this opinion flow be the prolific womb which have bring forth innumerable errors and difficulties in all part of philosophy and in all the sciences but this matter take in its full extent be a subject too comprehensive to be insist on in this place and so much for extension in abstract some perhaps may think pure space vacuum or trine dimension to be equally the object of sight and touch but though we have a very great propension to think the ideas of outness and space to be the immediate object of sight yet if i mistake not in the forego part of this essay that hath be clearly demonstrate to be a mere delusion arise from the quick and sudden suggestion of fancy which so closely connect the idea of distance with those of sight that we be apt to think it be itself a proper and immediate object of that sense till reason correct the mistake it have be show that there be no abstract ideas of figure and that it be impossible for us by any precision of think to frame an idea of extension separate from all other visible and tangible qualities which shall be common both to sight and touch the question now remain be whether the particular extensions figure and motion perceive by sight be of the same kind with the particular extensions figure and motion perceive by touch in answer to which i shall venture to lay down the follow proposition the extension figure and motion perceive by sight be specifically distinct from the ideas of touch call by the same name nor be there any such thing as one idea or kind of idea common to both sense this proposition may without much difficulty be collect from what hath be say in several place of this essay but because it seem so remote from and contrary to the receive notions and settle opinion of mankind i shall attempt to demonstrate it more particularly and at large by the follow arguments when upon perception of an idea i range it under this or that sort it be because it be perceive after the same manner or because it have a liken or conformity with or affect me in the same way as the ideas of the sort i rank it under in short it must not be entirely new but have something in it old and already perceive by me it must i say have so much at least in common with the ideas i have before know and name as to make me give it the same name with them but it have be if i mistake not clearly make out that a man bear blind would not at first reception of his sight think the things he saw be of the same nature with the object of touch or have anything in common with them but that they be a new set of ideas perceive in a new manner and entirely different from all he have ever perceive before so that he would not call them by the same name nor repute them to be of the same sort with anything he have hitherto know secondly light and colour be allow by all to constitute a son or species entirely different from the ideas of touch nor will any man i presume say they can make themselves perceive by that sense but there be no other immediate object of sight besides light and colour it be therefore a direct consequence that there be no idea common to both sense it be a prevail opinion even amongst those who have think and writ most accurately concern our ideas and the ways whereby they enter into the understand that something more be perceive by sight than barely light and colour with their variations mr locke termeth sight the most comprehensive of all our sense convey to our mind the ideas of light and colour which be peculiar only to that sense and also the far different ideas of space figure and motion essay on human understand b ii c s space or distance we have show be not otherwise the object of sight than of hear vid sect and as for figure and extension i leave it to anyone that shall calmly attend to his own clear and distinct ideas to decide whether he have any idea intromit immediately and properly by sight save only light and colour or whether it de possible for him to frame in his mind a distinct abstract idea of visible extension or figure exclusive of all colour and on the other hand whether he can conceive colour without visible extension for my own part i must confess i be not able to attain so great a nicety of abstraction in a strict sense i see nothing but light and colour with their several shade and variations he who beside these doth also perceive by sight ideas far different and distinct from them hath that faculty in a degree more perfect and comprehensive than i can pretend to it must be own that by the mediation of light and colour other far different ideas be suggest to my mind but so they be by hear which beside sound which be peculiar to that sense doth by their mediation suggest not only space figure and motion but also all other ideas whatsoever that can be signify by word thirdly it be i think an axiom universally receive that quantities of the same kind may be add together and make one entire sum mathematicians add line together but they do not add a line to a solid or conceive it as make one sum with a surface these three kinds of quantity be think incapable of any such mutual addition and consequently of be compare together in the several ways of proportion be by then esteem entirely disparate and heterogeneous now let anyone try in his thoughts to add a visible line or surface to a tangible line or surface so as to conceive them make one continue sum or whole he that can do this may think them homogeneous but he that can not must by the forego axiom think them heterogeneous a blue and a red line i can conceive add together into one sum and make one continue line but to make in my thoughts one continue line of a visible and tangible line add together be i find a task far more difficult and even insurmountable and i leave it to the reflexion and experience of every particular person to determine for himself a farther confirmation of our tenet may be draw from the solution of mr molyneuxs problem publish by mr locke in his essay which i shall set down as it there lie together with mr lock opinion of it suppose a man bear blind and now adult and teach by his touch to distinguish between a cube and a sphere of the same metal and nighly sic of the same bigness so as to tell when he felt one and tother which be the cube and which the sphere suppose then the cube and sphere place on a table and the blind man to be make to see quaere whether by his sight before he touch them he could now distinguish and tell which be the globe which the cube to which the acute and judicious proposer answer not for though he have obtain the experience of how a globe how a cube affect his touch yet he have not yet attain the experience that what affect his touch so or so must affect his sight so or so or that a protuberant angle in the cube that press his hand unequally shall appear to his eye as it doth in the cube i agree with this think gentleman whom i be proud to call my friend in his answer to this his problem and be of opinion that the blind man at first sight would not be able with certainty to say which be the globe which the cube whilst he only saw them essay on human understand b ii c s now if a square surface perceive by touch be of the same sort with a square surface perceive by sight it be certain the blind man here mention might know a square surface as soon as he saw it it be no more but introduce into his mind by a new inlet an idea he have be already well acquaint with since therefore he be suppose to have know by his touch that a cube be a body terminate by square surface and that a sphere be not terminate by square surface upon the supposition that a visible and tangible square differ only in numero it follow that he might know by the unerring mark of the square surface which be the cube and which not while he only saw them we must therefore allow either that visible extension and figure be specifically distinct from tangible extension and figure or else that the solution of this problem give by those two thoughtful and ingenious men be wrong much more might be lay together in proof of the proposition i have advance but what have be say be if i mistake not sufficient to convince anyone that shall yield a reasonable attention and as for those that will not be at the pain of a little think no multiplication of word will ever suffice to make them understand the truth or rightly conceive my mean i can not let go the abovementioned problem without some reflexion on it it hath be evident that a man blind from his birth would not at first sight denominate anything he saw by the name he have be use to appropriate to ideas of touch vid sect cube sphere table be word he have know apply to things perceivable by touch but to things perfectly intangible he never know them apply those word in their wonted application always mark out to his mind body or solid things which be perceive by the resistance they give but there be no solidity no resistance or protrusion perceive by sight in short the ideas of sight be all new perceptions to which there be no name annex in his mind he can not therefore understand what be say to him concern them and to ask of the two body he saw place on the table which be the sphere which the cube be to him a question downright banter and unintelligible nothing he see be able to suggest to his thoughts the idea of body distance or in general of anything he have already know it be a mistake to think the same thing affect both sight and touch if the same angle or square which be the object of touch be also the object of vision what should hinder the blind man at first sight from know it for though the manner wherein it affect the sight be different from that wherein it affect his touch yet there be beside his manner or circumstance which be new and unknown the angle or figure which be old and know he can not choose but discern it visible figure and extension have be demonstrate to be of a nature entirely different and heterogeneous from tangible figure and extension it remain that we inquire concern now that visible motion be not of the same sort with tangible motion seem to need no farther proof it be an evident corollary from what we have show concern the difference there be between visible and tangible extension but for a more full and express proof hereof we need only observe that one who have not yet experience vision would not at first sight know motion whence it clearly follow that motion perceivable by sight be of a sort distinct from motion perceivable by touch the antecedent i prove thus by touch he could not perceive any motion but what be up or down to the right or leave nearer or farther from him besides these and their several varieties or complications it be impossible he should have any idea of motion he would not therefore think anything to be motion or give the name motion to any idea which he could not range under some or other of those particular kinds thereof but from sect it be plain that by the mere act of vision he could not know motion upwards or downwards to the right or leave or in any other possible direction from which i conclude he would not know motion at all at first sight as for the idea of motion in abstract i shall not waste paper about it but leave it to my reader to make the best he can of it to me it be perfectly unintelligible the consideration of motion may furnish a new field for inquiry but since the manner wherein the mind apprehend by sight the motion of tangible object with the various degrees thereof may be easily collect from what hath be say concern the manner wherein that sense doth suggest their various distance magnitudes and situations i shall not enlarge any farther on this subject but proceed to consider what may be allege with greatest appearance of reason against the proposition we have show to be true for where there be so much prejudice to be encounter a bare and naked demonstration of the truth will scarce suffice we must also satisfy the scruple that men may raise in favour of their preconceive notions show whence the mistake arise how it come to spread and carefully disclose and root out those false persuasions that an early prejudice might have implant in the mind first therefore it will be demand how visible extension and figure come to be call by the same name with tangible extension and figure if they be not of the same kind with them it must be something more than humour or accident that could occasion a custom so constant and universal as this which have obtain in all age and nations of the world and amongst all rank of men the learn as well as the illiterate to which i answer we can no more argue a visible and tangible square to be of the same species from their be call by the same name than we can that a tangible square and the monosyllable consist of six letter whereby it be mark be of the same species because they be both call by the same name it be customary to call write word and the things they signify by the same name for word not be regard in their own nature or otherwise than as they be mark of things it have be superfluous and beside the design of language to have give them name distinct from those of the things mark by them the same reason hold here also visible figure be the mark of tangible figure and from sect it be plain that in themselves they be little regard or upon any other score than for their connexion with tangible figure which by nature they be ordain to signify and because this language of nature doth not vary in different age or nations hence it be that in all time and place visible figure be call by the same name as the respective tangible figure suggest by them and not because they be alike or of the same sort with them but say you surely a tangible square be liker to a visible square than to a visible circle it have four angle and as many side so also have the visible square but the visible circle have no such thing be bound by one uniform curve without right line or angle which make it unfit to represent the tangible square but very fit to represent the tangible circle whence it clearly follow that visible figure be pattern of or of the same species with the respective tangible figure represent by them that they be like unto them and of their own nature fit to represent them as be of the same sort and that they be in no respect arbitrary sign as word i answer it must be acknowledge the visible square be fitter than the visible circle to represent the tangible square but then it be not because it be liker or more of a species with it but because the visible square contain in it several distinct part whereby to mark the several distinct correspond part of a tangible square whereas the visible circle doth not the square perceive by touch hath four distinct equal side so also hath it four distinct equal angle it be therefore necessary that the visible figure which shall be most proper to mark it contain four distinct equal part correspond to the four side of the tangible square as likewise four other distinct and equal part whereby to denote the four equal angle of the tangible square and accordingly we see the visible figure contain in them distinct visible part answer to the distinct tangible part of the figure signify or suggest by them but it will not hence follow that any visible figure be like unto or of the same species with its correspond tangible figure unless it be also show that not only the number but also the kind of the part be the same in both to illustrate this i observe that visible figure represent tangible figure much after the same manner that write word do sound now in this respect word be not arbitrary it not be indifferent what write word stand for any sound but it be requisite that each word contain in it so many distinct character as there be variations in the sound it stand for thus the single letter a be proper to mark one simple uniform sound and the word adultery be accommodate to represent the sound annex to it in the formation whereof there be eight different collisions or modifications of the air by the organs of speech each of which produce a difference of sound it be fit the word represent it should consist of as many distinct character thereby to mark each particular difference or part of the whole sound and yet nobody i presume will say the single letter a or the word adultery be like unto or of the same species with the respective sound by them represent it be indeed arbitrary that in general letter of any language represent sound at all but when that be once agree it be not arbitrary what combination of letter shall represent this or that particular sound i leave this with the reader to pursue and apply it in his own thoughts it must be confess that we be not so apt to confound other sign with the things signify or to think them of the same species as we be visible and tangible ideas but a little consideration will show us how this may be without our suppose them of a like nature these sign be constant and universal their connexion with tangible ideas have be learn at our first entrance into the world and ever since almost every moment of our live it have be occur to our thoughts and fasten and strike deeper on our mind when we observe that sign be variable and of human institution when we remember there be a time they be not connect in our mind with those things they now so readily suggest but that their signification be learn by the slow step of experience this preserve us from confound them but when we find the same sign suggest the same things all over the world when we know they be not of human institution and can not remember that we ever learn their signification but think that at first sight they would have suggest to us the same things they do now all this persuade us they be of the same species as the things respectively represent by them and that it be by a natural resemblance they suggest them to our mind add to this that whenever we make a nice survey of any object successively direct the optic axis to each point thereof there be certain line and figure describe by the motion of the head or eye which be in truth perceive by feel do nevertheless so mix themselves as it be with the ideas of sight that we can scarce think but they appertain to that sense again the ideas of sight enter into the mind several at once more distinct and unmingled than be usual in the other sense beside the touch sound for example perceive at the same instant be apt to coalesce if i may so say into one sound but we can perceive at the same time great variety of visible object very separate and distinct from each other now tangible extension be make up of several distinct coexistent part we may hence gather another reason that may dispose us to imagine a liken or an analogy between the immediate object of sight and touch but nothing certainly doth more contribute to blend and confound them together than the strict and close connexion they have with each other we can not open our eye but the ideas of distance body and tangible figure be suggest by them so swift and sudden and unperceived be the transition from visible to tangible ideas that we can scarce forbear think them equally the immediate object of vision the prejudice which be ground on these and whatever other cause may be assign thereof stick so fast that it be impossible without obstinate strive and labour of the mind to get entirely clear of it but then the reluctancy we find in reject any opinion can be no argument of its truth to whoever consider what have be already show with regard to the prejudice we entertain concern the distance magnitude and situation of object prejudice so familiar to our mind so confirm and inveterate as they will hardly give way to the clearest demonstration upon the whole i think we may fairly conclude that the proper object of vision constitute an universal language of the author of nature whereby we be instruct how to regulate our action in order to attain those things that be necessary to the preservation and wellbeing of our body as also to avoid whatever may be hurtful and destructive of them it be by their information that we be principally guide in all the transactions and concern of life and the manner wherein they signify and mark unto us the object which be at a distance be the same with that of languages and sign of human appointment which do not suggest the things signify by any liken or identity of nature but only by an habitual connexion that experience have make us to observe between them suppose one who have always continue blind be tell by his guide that after he have advance so many step he shall come to the brink of a precipice or be stop by a wall must not this to him seem very admirable and surprizing he can not conceive how it be possible for mortals to frame such predictions as these which to him would seem as strange and unaccountable as prophesy doth to others even they who be bless with the visive faculty may though familiarity make it less observe find therein sufficient cause of admiration the wonderful art and contrivance wherewith it be adjust to those end and purpose for which it be apparently design the vast extent number and variety of object that be at once with so much ease and quickness and pleasure suggest by it all these afford subject for much and please speculation and may if anything give us some glimmer analogous prenotion of things which be place beyond the certain discovery and comprehension of our present state i do not design to trouble myself with draw corollaries from the doctrine i have hitherto lay down if it bear the test others may so far as they shall think convenient employ their thoughts in extend it farther and apply it to whatever purpose it may be subservient to only i can not forbear make some inquiry concern the object of geometry which the subject we have be upon doth naturally lead one to we have show there be no such idea as that of extension in abstract and that there be two kinds of sensible extension and figure which be entirely distinct and heterogeneous from each other now it be natural to inquire which of these be the object of geometry some things there be which at first sight incline one to think geometry conversant about visible extension the constant use of the eye both in the practical and speculative part of that science doth very much induce us thereto it would without doubt seem odd to a mathematician to go about to convince him the diagram he saw upon paper be not the figure or even the liken of the figure which make the subject of the demonstration the contrary be hold an unquestionable truth not only by mathematicians but also by those who apply themselves more particularly to the study of logic i mean who consider the nature of science certainty and demonstration it be by them assign as one reason of the extraordinary clearness and evidence of geometry that in this science the reason be free from those inconvenience which attend the use of arbitrary sign the very ideas themselves be copy out and expose to view upon paper but by the bye how well this agree with what they likewise assert of abstract ideas be the object of geometrical demonstration i leave to be consider to come to a resolution in this point we need only observe what hath be say in sect where it be show that visible extensions in themselves be little regard and have no settle determinable greatness and that men measure altogether by the application of tangible extension to tangible extension all which make it evident that visible extension and figure be not the object of geometry it be therefore plain that visible figure be of the same use in geometry that word be and the one may as well be account the object of that science as the other neither of them be otherwise concern therein than as they represent or suggest to the mind the particular tangible figure connect with them there be indeed this difference between the signification of tangible figure by visible figure and of ideas by word that whereas the latter be variable and uncertain depend altogether on the arbitrary appointment of men the former be fix and immutably the same in all time and place a visible square for instance suggest to the mind the same tangible figure in europe that it doth in america hence it be that the voice of the author of nature which speak to our eye be not liable to that misinterpretation and ambiguity that languages of human contrivance be unavoidably subject to though what have be say may suffice to show what ought to be determine with relation to the object of geometry i shall nevertheless for the fuller illustration thereof consider the case of an intelligence or unbodied spirit which be suppose to see perfectly well ie to have a clear perception of the proper and immediate object of sight but to have no sense of touch whether there be any such be in nature or no be beside my purpose to inquire it sufficeth that the supposition contain no contradiction in it let us now examine what proficiency such a one may be able to make in geometry which speculation will lead us more clearly to see whether the ideas of sight can possibly be the object of that science first then it be certain the aforesaid intelligence could have no idea of a solid or quantity of three dimension which followeth from its not have any idea of distance we indeed be prone to think that we have by sight the ideas of space and solids which ariseth from our imagine that we do strictly speak see distance and some part of an object at a greater distance than others which hath be demonstrate to be the effect of the experience we have have what ideas of touch be connect with such and such ideas attend vision but the intelligence here speak of be suppose to have no experience of touch he would not therefore judge as we do nor have any idea of distance outness or profundity nor consequently of space or body either immediately or by suggestion whence it be plain he can have no notion of those part of geometry which relate to the mensuration of solids and their convex or concave surface and contemplate the properties of line generate by the section of a solid the conceive of any part whereof be beyond the reach of his faculties farther he can not comprehend the manner wherein geometers describe a right line or circle the rule and compass with their use be things of which it be impossible he should have any notion nor be it an easier matter for him to conceive the place of one plane or angle on another in order to prove their equality since that supposeth some idea of distance or external space all which make it evident our pure intelligence could never attain to know so much as the first elements of plane geometry and perhaps upon a nice inquiry it will be find he can not even have an idea of plane figure any more than he can of solids since some idea of distance be necessary to form the idea of a geometrical plane as will appear to whoever shall reflect a little on it all that be properly perceive by the visive faculty amount to no more than colour with their variations and different proportion of light and shade but the perpetual mutability and fleetingness of those immediate object of sight render them incapable of be manage after the manner of geometrical figure nor be it in any degree useful that they should it be true there be divers of them perceive at once and more of some and less of others but accurately to compute their magnitude and assign precise determinate proportion between things so variable and inconstant if we suppose it possible to be do must yet be a very trifle and insignificant labour i must confess men be tempt to think that flat or plane figure be immediate object of sight though they acknowledge solids be not and this opinion be ground on what be observe in paint wherein it seem the ideas immediately imprint on the mind be only of plan variously colour which by a sudden act of the judgment be change into solids but with a little attention we shall find the plan here mention as the immediate object of sight be not visible but tangible plan for when we say that picture be plan we mean thereby that they appear to the touch smooth and uniform but then this smoothness and uniformity or in other word this planeness of the picture be not perceive immediately by vision for it appeareth to the eye various and multiform from all which we may conclude that plan be no more the immediate object of sight than solids what we strictly see be not solids nor yet plan variously colour they be only diversity of colour and some of these suggest to the mind solids and other plane figure just as they have be experience to be connect with the one or the other so that we see plan in the same way that we see solids both be equally suggest by the immediate object of sight which accordingly be themselves denominate plan and solids but though they be call by the same name with the things mark by them they be nevertheless of a nature entirely different as hath be demonstrate what hath be say be if i mistake not sufficient to decide the question we propose to examine concern the ability of a pure spirit such as we have describe to know geometry it be indeed no easy matter for us to enter precisely into the thoughts of such an intelligence because we can not without great pain cleverly separate and disentangle in our thoughts the proper object of sight from those of touch which be connect with them this indeed in a complete degree seem scarce possible to be perform which will not seem strange to us if we consider how hard it be for anyone to hear the word of his native language pronounce in his ears without understand them though he endeavour to disunite the mean from the sound it will nevertheless intrude into his thoughts and he shall find it extreme difficult if not impossible to put himself exactly in the posture of a foreigner that never learn the language so as to be affect barely with the sound themselves and not perceive the signification annex to them by this time i suppose it be clear that neither abstract nor visible extension make the object of geometry the not discern of which may perhaps have create some difficulty and useless labour in mathematics sure i be that somewhat relate thereto have occur to my thoughts which though after the most anxious and repeat examination i be force to think it true doth nevertheless seem so far out of the common road of geometry that i know not whether it may not be think presumption if i should make it public in an age wherein that science hath receive such mighty improvements by new methods great part whereof as well as of the ancient discoveries may perhaps lose their reputation and much of that ardour with which men study the abstruse and fine geometry be abate if what to me and those few to whom i have impart it seem evidently true should really prove to be sothree dialogues between hylas and philonous in opposition to sceptics and atheists george berkeley content the first dialogue the second dialogue the third dialogue the first dialogue philonous good morning hylas i didnt expect to find you out and about so early hylas it be indeed somewhat unusual but my thoughts be so take up with a subject i be talk about last night that i couldnt sleep so i decide to get up and walk in the garden thats good it give you a chance to see what innocent and agreeable pleasures you lose every morning can there be a pleasanter time of the day or a more delightful season of the year that purple sky those wild but sweet note of bird the fragrant bloom on the tree and flower the gentle influence of the rise sun these and a thousand nameless beauties of nature inspire the soul with secret raptures but im afraid i be interrupt your thoughts for you seem very intent on something yes i be and id be grateful if you would allow me to carry on with it but i dont in the least want to deprive myself of your company for my thoughts always flow more easily in conversation with a friend than when i be alone please may i share with you the thoughts i have be have with all my heart it be what i would have request myself if you hadnt ask first i be consider the odd fate of those men who have in all age through a desire to mark themselves off from the common people or through heaven know what trick of their think claim either to believe nothing at all or to believe the most extravagant things in the world this wouldnt matter so much if their paradoxes and scepticism didnt bring consequences that be bad for mankind in general but theres a risk that they will do that and that when men who be think to have spend their whole time in the pursuit of knowledge claim to be entirely ignorant of everything or advocate view that be in conflict with plain and commonly accept principles this will tempt other peoplewho have less leisure for this sort of thingto become suspicious of the most important truths ones they have previously think to be sacred and unquestionable i entirely agree with you about the bad effect of the parade doubt of some philosophers and the fantastical view of others i have felt this so strongly in recent time that i have drop some of the highflown theories i have learn in their universities replace them with ordinary common opinions since this revolt of mine against metaphysical notions and in favour of the plain dictate of nature and common sense i swear that i find i can think ever so much better so that i can now easily understand many things which previously be mysteries and riddle i be glad to find there be nothing in the account i hear of you what if you please be they in last nights conversation you be represent as someone who maintain the most extravagant opinion that ever enter into the mind of man namely that there be no such thing as material substance in the world i seriously believe that there be no such thing as what philosophers call material substance but if i be make to see anything absurd or sceptical in this then i would have the same reason to renounce this belief as i think i have now to reject the contrary opinion what can anything be more fantastical more in conflict with common sense or a more obvious piece of scepticism than to believe there be no such thing as matter steady on hylas what if it be to turn out that you who hold that there be matter areby virtue of that opiniona greater sceptic and maintain more paradoxes and conflict with common sense than i who believe no such thing you have as good a chance of convince me that the part be greater than the whole as of convince me that i must give up my belief in matter if i be to avoid absurdity and scepticism well then be you content to accept as true any opinion that turn out to be the most agreeable to common sense and most remote from scepticism with all my heart since you want to start arguments about the plainest things in the world i be content for once to hear what you have to say tell me please hylas what do you mean by a sceptic i mean what everyone mean someone who doubt everything so if someone have no doubt concern some particular point then with regard to that point he can not be think a sceptic i agree with you do doubt consist in accept the affirmative or the negative side of a question neither anyone who understand english must know that doubt signify a suspense between the two side so if someone deny any point he can no more be say to doubt concern it than he who affirm it with the same degree of assurance true and so his denial no more make him a sceptic than the other be i acknowledge it then how do it happen hylas that you call me a sceptic because i deny what you affirm namely the existence of matter for all you know i may be as firmly convince in my denial as you be in your affirmation hold on a moment philonous my definition of sceptic be wrong but you cant hold a man to every false step he make in conversation i do say that a sceptic be someone who doubt everything but i should have add or who deny the reality and truth of things what things do you mean the principles and theorems of sciences but these you know be universal intellectual notions and have nothing to do with matter so that the denial of matter doesnt imply the denial of them i agree about that but what about other things what do you think about distrust the sense deny the real existence of sensible things or claim to know nothing of them isnt that enough to qualify a man as a sceptic throughout the dialogues sensible mean capable of be sensedthat be visible or audible or tangible etc well then let us see which of us it be that deny the reality of sensible things or claim to have the greatest ignorance of them since if i understand you rightly he be to be count the greater sceptic that be what i desire what do you mean by sensible things things that be perceive by the sense can you imagine that i mean anything else im sorry but it may greatly shorten our enquiry if i have a clear grasp of your notions bear with me then while i ask you this further question be things perceive by the sense only the ones that be perceive immediately or do they include things that be perceive mediately that be through the intervention of something else i dont properly understand you in read a book what i immediately perceive be the letter on the page but mediately or by mean of these the notions of god virtue truth etc be suggest to my mind now theres no doubt that the letter be truly sensible things or things perceive by sense but i want to know whether you take the things suggest by them to be perceive by sense too no certainly it would be absurd to think that god or virtue be sensible things though they may be signify and suggest to the mind by sensible mark with which they have an arbitrary connection it seem then that by sensible things you mean only those that can be perceive immediately by sense right doesnt it follow from this that when i see one part of the sky red and another blue and i infer from this that there must be some cause for that difference of colour that cause can not be say to be a sensible thing or perceive by eyesight it do similarly when i hear a variety of sound i can not be say to hear their cause you can not and when by touch i feel a thing to be hot and heavy i cant say with any truth or correctness that i feel the cause of its heat or weight to head off any more question of this kind i tell you once and for all that by sensible things i mean only things that be perceive by sense and that the sense perceive only what they perceive immediately because they dont make inferences so the deduce of cause or occasion from effect and appearances which be the only things we perceive by sense be entirely the business of reason in this context occasion can be take as equivalent to cause the two term be separate in the second dialogue at page we agree then that sensible things include only things that be immediately perceive by sense now tell me whether we immediately perceive by sight anything besides light colour and shape by hear anything but sound by the palate anything besides taste by the sense of smell anything besides odours by touch anything more than tangible qualities we do not so it seem that if you take away all sensible qualities there be nothing leave that be sensible i agree sensible things then be nothing but so many sensible qualities or combinations of sensible qualities nothing else so heat be a sensible thing certainly do the reality of sensible things consist in be perceive or be it something different from their be perceivedsomething that doesnt involve the mind to exist be one thing and to be perceive be another i be talk only about sensible things my question be by the real existence of one of them do you mean an existence exterior to the mind and distinct from their be perceive i mean a real absolute existencedistinct from and have no relation to their be perceive so if heat be grant to have a real existence it must exist outside the mind it must tell me hylas be this real existence equally possible for all degrees of heat that we feel or be there a reason why we should attribute it to some degrees of heat and not to others if there be please tell me what it be whatever degree of heat we perceive by sense we can be sure exist also in the object that occasion it what the greatest as well as the least yes because the same reason hold for both they be both perceive by sense indeed the greater degree of heat be more intensely sensibly perceive so if there be any difference it be that we be more certain of the real existence of a greater heat than we can be of the reality of a lesser but isnt the most fierce and intense degree of heat a very great pain noone can deny that and can any unperceiving thing have pain or pleasure certainly not be your material substance a senseless thing or do it have sense and perception it be senseless without doubt so it cant be the subject of pain indeed it cant nor consequently can it be the subject of the greatest heat perceive by sense since you agree that this be a considerable pain i accept that then what be we to say about your external object be it a material substance or be it not it be a material substance with the sensible qualities inhere in it but then how can a great heat exist in it since you agree it can not exist in a material substance please clear up this point hold on philonous im afraid i go wrong in grant that intense heat be a pain i should have say not that the pain be the heat but that it be the consequence or effect of the heat when you put your hand near the fire do you feel one simple uniform sensation or two distinct sensations just one simple sensation isnt the heat immediately perceive it be and the pain true well then see that they be both immediately perceive at the same time and that the fire affect you with only one simple or uncompounded idea one idea without part it follow that this one simple idea be both the immediately perceive intense heat and the pain and consequently that the immediately perceive intense heat be identical with a particular sort of pain it seem so consult your thoughts again hylas can you conceive an intense sensation to occur without pain or pleasure i can not or can you form an idea of sensible pain or pleasure in general abstract from every particular idea of heat cold taste smell etc i dont find that i can then doesnt it follow that sensible pain be nothing but intense degrees of those sensations or ideas that be undeniable in fact im start to suspect that a very great heat cant exist except in a mind perceive it what be you then in that sceptical state of suspense between affirm and deny i think i can be definite about it a very violent and painful heat cant exist outside the mind so accord to you it have no real existence i admit it be it certain then that no body in nature be really hot i havent say that there be no real heat in body i only say that theres no such thing as an intense real heat in body but didnt you say earlier that all degrees of heat be equally real or that if there be any difference the greater heat be more certainly real than the lesser yes i do but that be because i have overlook the reason there be for distinguish between them which i now plainly see it be this because intense heat be nothing but a particular kind of painful sensation and pain cant exist except in a perceive be it follow that no intense heat can really exist in an unperceiving corporeal bodily substance but thats no reason for deny that less intense heat can exist in such a substance but how be we to draw the line separate degrees of heat that exist only in the mind from ones that exist outside it that isnt hard the slightest pain cant exist unperceived as you know so any degree of heat that be a pain exist only in the mind we dont have to think the same for degrees of heat that be not pain i think you agree a while back that no unperceiving be be capable of pleasure any more than it be of pain i do well isnt warmtha milder degree of heat than what cause discomfort or worsea pleasure what of it it follow that warmth cant exist outside the mind in any unperceiving substance or body so it seem so we have reach the position that degrees of heat that arent painful and also ones that be can exist only in a think substance cant we conclude from this that external body be absolutely incapable of any degree of heat whatsoever on second thoughts i be less sure that warmth be a pleasure than i be that intense heat be a pain i dont claim that warmth be as great a pleasure as heat be a pain but if you admit it to be even a small pleasure that be enough to yield my conclusion i could rather call it absence of pain it seem to be merely the lack of pain and of pleasure i hope you wont deny that this quality or state be one that an unthinking substance can have if you be determine to maintain that warmth be not a pleasure i dont know how to convince you otherwise except by appeal to your own experience but what do you think about cold the same as i do about heat an intense degree of cold be a pain for to feel a very great cold be to experience a great discomfort so it cant exist outside the mind but a lesser degree of cold can exist outside the mind as well as a lesser degree of heat so when we feel a moderate degree of heat or cold from a body that be apply to our skin we must conclude that that body have a moderate degree of heat or cold in it we must can any doctrine be true if it necessarily lead to absurdity certainly not isnt it an absurdity to think that a single thing should be at the same time both cold and warm it be well now suppose that one of your hand be hot and the other cold and that they be both at once plunge into a bowl of water that have a temperature between the two wont the water seem cold to one hand and warm to the other it will then doesnt it follow by your principles that the water really be both cold and warm at the same timethus believe something that you agree to be an absurdity i admit that that seem right so the principles themselves be false since you have admit that no true principle lead to an absurdity but after all can anything be more absurd than to say that there be no heat in the fire to make the point still clearer answer me this in two case that be exactly alike oughtnt we to make the same judgment we ought when a pin prick your finger doesnt it tear and divide the fibres of your flesh it do and when hot coal burn your finger do it do any more it do not you hold that the pin itself doesnt contain either the sensation that it cause or anything like it so give what you have just agree tonamely that like case should be judge alikeyou ought to hold that the fire doesnt contain either the sensation that it cause or anything like it well since it must be so i be content to give up this point and admit that heat and cold be only sensations exist in our mind still there be plenty of other qualities through which to secure the reality of external things but what will you say hylas if it turn out that the same argument apply with regard to all other sensible qualities and that none of them can be suppose to exist outside the mind any more than heat and cold can prove that would be quite a feat but i see no chance of your do so let us examine the other sensible qualities in order what about taste do you think they exist outside the mind or not can anyone in his right mind doubt that sugar be sweet or that wormwood be bitter tell me hylas be a sweet taste a particular kind of pleasure or pleasant sensation or be it not it be and isnt bitterness some kind of discomfort or pain i grant that if therefore sugar and wormwood be unthinking corporeal substances exist outside the mind how can sweetness and bitternessthat be pleasure and painbe in them hold on philonous now i see what have delude me all this time you ask whether heat and cold sweetness and bitterness be particular sort of pleasure and pain to which i answer simply that they be i should have answer by make a distinction those qualities as perceive by us be pleasures or pain but as exist in the external object they be not so we can not conclude without qualification that there be no heat in the fire or sweetness in the sugar but only that heat or sweetness as perceive by us be not in the fire or the sugar what do you say to this i say it be irrelevant we be talk only about sensible things which you define as things we immediately perceive by our sense whatever other qualities you be talk about have no place in our conversation and i dont know anything about them you may indeed claim to have discover certain qualities that you dont perceive and assert that they exist in fire and sugar but i cant for the life of me see how that serve your side in the argument we be have tell me then once more do you agree that heat and cold sweetness and bitterness mean the qualities that be perceive by the sense dont exist outside the mind i see it be no use hold out so i give up the cause with respect to those four qualities though i must say it sound odd to say that sugar isnt sweet it might sound better to you if you bear this in mind someone whose palate be diseased may experience as bitter stuff that at other time seem sweet to him and its perfectly obvious that different people perceive different taste in the same food since what one man delight in another loathe how could this be if the taste be really inherent in the food i admit that i dont know how now think about odours dont they exactly fit what i have just be say about taste arent they just so many please or displease sensations they be then can you conceive it to be possible that they should exist in an unperceiving thing i can not or can you imagine that filth and excrement affect animals that choose to fee on them with the same smell that we perceive in them by no mean then cant we conclude that smell like the other qualities we have be discuss can not exist anywhere but in a perceive substance or mind i think so what about sound be they qualities really inherent in external body or not they dont inhere in the sound body we know this because when a bell be strike in a vacuum it send out no sound so the subject of sound must be the air explain that hylas when the air be set into motion we perceive a louder or softer sound in proportion to the air motion but when the air be still we hear no sound at all grant that we never hear a sound except when some motion be produce in the air i still dont see how you can infer from this that the sound itself be in the air this motion in the external air be what produce in the mind the sensation of sound by strike on the eardrum it cause a vibration which be pass along the auditory nerve to the brain whereon the mind experience the sensation call sound what be sound a sensation as i say as perceive by us it be a particular sensation in the mind and can any sensation exist outside the mind no certainly but if sound be a sensation how can it exist in the air if by the air you mean a senseless substance exist outside the mind philonous you must distinguish sound as it be perceive by us from sound as it be in itself orin other wordsdistinguish the sound we immediately perceive from the sound that exist outside us the former be indeed a particular kind of sensation but the latter be merely a vibration in the air i think i have already flatten that distinction by the answer i give when you be apply it in a similar case before but ill let that pass be you sure then that sound be really nothing but motion i be whatever be true of real sound therefore can truthfully be say of motion it may so it make sense to speak of motion as something that be loud sweet pierce or lowpitched i see you be determine not to understand me isnt it obvious that those qualities belong only to sensible sound or sound in the ordinary everyday mean of the word but not to sound in the real and scientific sense which as i have just explain be nothing but a certain motion of the air it seem then there be two sort of soundthe common everyday sort that we hear and the scientific and real sort that we dont hear just so and the latter kind of sound consist in motion as i tell you tell me hylas which of the sense do you think the idea of motion belong to the sense of hear certainly not to the sense of sight and touch it should follow then accord to you that real sound may possibly be see or felt but can never be hear look philonous make fun of my view if you want to but that wont alter the truth of things i admit that the inferences you draw from them sound a little odd but ordinary language be form by ordinary people for their own use so its not surprise if statements that express exact scientific notions seem clumsy and strange be it come to that i assure you i think i have score a pretty big win when you so casually depart from ordinary phrase and opinions because what we be mainly argue about be whose notions be furthest from the common road and most in conflict with what people in general think your claim that real sound be never hear and that we get our idea of sound through some other sensecan you think that this be merely an oddsounding scientific truth isnt something in it contrary to nature and the truth of things frankly i dont like it either give the concessions i have already make i have better admit that sound also have no real existence outside the mind and i hope you wont stick at admit the same of colour pardon me the case of colour be very different can anything be more obvious than the fact that we see colour on the object the object you speak of be i suppose corporeal substances exist outside the mind they be and they have true and real colour inhere in them each visible object have the colour that we see in it hah be there anything visible other than what we perceive by sight there be not and do we perceive anything by our sense that we dont perceive immediately how often do i have to say it i tell you we do not bear with me hylas and tell me yet again whether anything be immediately perceive by the sense other than sensible qualities i know you assert that nothing be but i want to know now whether you still think so i do now be your corporeal substance either a sensible quality or make up of sensible qualities what a question to ask who ever think it be here be why i ask when you say that each visible object have the colour that we see in it you imply that either visible object be sensible qualities or else something other than sensible qualities can be perceive by sight but we earlier agree that be false and you still think it be so we be leave with the thesis that visible object be sensible qualities now in this conversation you have be take it that visible object be corporeal substances and so we reach the conclusion that your corporeal substances be nothing but sensible qualities you may draw as many absurd consequences as you please and try to entangle the plainest things but you will never persuade me out of my sense i clearly understand my own mean i wish you would make me understand it too but since you dont want me to look into your notion of corporeal substance i shall drop that point but please tell me whether the colour that we see be the very ones that exist in external body or some other colour they be the very same ones oh then be the beautiful red and purple that we see on those cloud over there really in them or do you rather think that the cloud in themselves be nothing but a dark mist or vapour i must admit philonous that those colour arent really in the cloud as they seem to be at this distance they be only apparent colour apparent call you them how be we to distinguish these apparent colour from real ones very easily when a colour appear only at a distance and vanish when one come closer it be merely apparent and i suppose that real colour be ones that be reveal by look carefully from close up right do the closest and most careful way of look use a microscope or only the naked eye a microscope of course but a microscope often reveal colour in an object different from those perceive by unassisted sight and if we have microscopes that could magnify to as much as we like it be certain that no object whatsoever when see through them would appear with the same colour that it present to the naked eye well what do you conclude from that you cant argue that there be really and naturally no colour on object just because we can contrive artificial ways to alter them or make them vanish it can obviously be infer from your own concessions i think that all the colour we see with our naked eye be only apparentlike those on the cloudssince they vanish when one look more closely and accurately as one can with a microscope and to anticipate your next objection i ask you whether the real and natural state of an object be reveal better by a very sharp and pierce sight or by one that be less sharp by the former without doubt isnt it plain from the science of optics that microscopes make the sight more penetrate and represent object as they would appear to the eye if it be naturally endow with extreme sharpness it be so the microscopic representation of a thing should be regard as the one that best display the things real nature or what the thing be in itself so the colour perceive through a microscope be more genuine and real than those perceive in any other way i admit that theres something in what you say besides its not only possible but clearly true that there actually be animals whose eye be naturally form to perceive things that be too small for us to see what do you think about those inconceivably small animals that we perceive through microscopes must we suppose they be all totally blind if they can see dont we have to suppose that their sight have the same use in preserve their body from injuries as eyesight do in all other animals if it do have that use isnt it obvious that they must see particles that be smaller than their own body which will present them with a vastly different view of each object from the view that strike our sense even our own eye dont always represent object to us in the same way everyone know that to someone suffer from jaundice all things seem yellow so isnt it highly probable that animals whose eye we see to be differently structure from ours and whose bodily fluids be unlike ours dont see the same colour as we do in every object from all of this shouldnt it seem to follow that all colour be equally apparent and that none of the ones that we see be really in any outer object it should to put it past all doubt consider the follow if colour be real properties or qualities inhere in external body they couldnt be alter except by some alteration in the very body themselves but isnt it evident that the colour of an object can be change or make to disappear entirely through the use of a microscope or some change in the fluids in the eye or a change in the view distance without any sort of real alteration in the thing itself indeed even when all the other factor remain unaltered some object present different colour to the eye depend on the angle from which they be look at the same thing happen when we view an object in different brightnesses of light and everyone know that the same body appear differently colour by candlelight from what they do in daylight add to these facts our experience of a prism which separate the different ray of light and thereby alter the colour of an object cause the whitest object to appear deep blue or red to the naked eye now tell me whether you still think that each body have its true real colour inhere in it if you think it have i want to know what particular distance and orientation of the object what special condition of the eye what intensity or kind of light be need for discover that true colour and distinguish it from the apparent ones i admit to be quite convince that they be all equally apparent that no such thing as colour really inhere in external body and that colour be wholly in the light what confirm me in this opinion be the fact that colour be more or less vivid depend on the brightness of the light and that when there be no light no colour be see furthermore if there be colour in external object how could we possibly perceive them no external body affect the mind unless it act first on our senseorgans and the only action of body be motion and this cant be communicate except in collisions so a distant object cant act on the eye and so cant enable itself or its properties to be perceive by the mind from this it plainly follow that what immediately cause the perception of colour be some substance that be in contact with the eyesuch as light what be light a substance i tell you philonous external light be simply a thin fluid substance whose tiny particles when agitate with a brisk motion and in various ways reflect to the eye from the different surface of outer object cause different motion in the optic nerve these motion be pass along to the brain where they cause various state and events and these be accompany by the sensations of red blue yellow etc it seem then that all the light do be to shake the optic nerve that be all and as a result of each particular motion of the nerve the mind be affect with a sensation which be some particular colour right and these sensations have no existence outside the mind they have not then how can you say that colour be in the light since you take light to be a corporeal substance external to the mind light and colour as immediately perceive by us can not exist outside the mind i admit that but in themselves they be only the motion and arrangements of certain insensible particles of matter colour then in the ordinary sensethat be understand to be the immediate object of sightcannot be have by any substance that doesnt perceive that be what i say well then you give up your position as regard those sensible qualities which be what all mankind take to be colour think what you like about the scientists invisible colour it be not my business to argue about them but i suggest that you consider whether it be wise for you in a discussion like this one to affirm that the red and blue we see be not real colour and that certain unknown motion and shape which no man ever do or could see be real colour arent these shock notions and arent they open to as many ridiculous inferences as those you have to give up in the case of sound i have to admit philonous that i cant keep this up any longer colour sound tastesin a word all that be term secondary qualitieshave no existence outside the mind but in grant this i dont take anything away from the reality of matter or external object because various philosophers maintain what i just do about secondary qualities and yet be the far from deny matter in this context philosophers mean philosophers and scientists to make this clearer philosophers divide sensible qualities into primary and secondary primary qualities be extendedness shape solidity gravity motion and rest they hold that these really exist in body secondary qualities be all the sensible qualities that arent primary and the philosophers assert that these be merely sensations or ideas exist nowhere but in the mind no doubt you be already aware of all this for my part i have long know that such an opinion be current among philosophers but i be never thoroughly convince of its truth till now so you still believe that extension and shape be inherent in external unthinking substances here extension could mean extendedness or it could mean size i do but what if the arguments that be bring against secondary qualities hold against these also why then i shall have to think that shape and extension also exist only in the mind be it your opinion that the very shape and extension that you perceive by sense exist in the outer object or material substance it be have all other animals as good reason as you do to think that the shape and extension that they see and feel be in the outer object surely they do if they can think at all tell me hylas do you think that the sense be give to all animals for their preservation and wellbeing in life or be they give only to men for that end i dont doubt that they have the same use in all other animals if so mustnt their sense enable them to perceive their own limbs and to perceive body that be capable of harm them certainly a tiny insect therefore must be suppose to see its own foot and other things of that size or even smaller see them all as body of considerable size even though you can see themif at allonly as so many visible point i cant deny that and to creatures even smaller than that insect they will seem even bigger they will so that something you can hardly pick out because it be so small will appear like a huge mountain to an extremely tiny animal i agree about all this can a single thing have different size at the same time it would be absurd to think so but from what you have say it follow that the true size of the insects foot be the size you see it have and the size the insect see it as have and all the size it be see as have by animals that be even smaller that be to say your own principles have lead you into an absurdity i seem to be in some difficulty about this another point didnt you agree that no real inherent property of any object can be change unless the thing itself alter i do but as we move towards or away from an object its visible size vary be at one distance ten or a hundred time greater than at another doesnt it follow from this too that size isnt really inherent in the object i admit that i dont know what to think you will soon be able to make up your mind if you will venture to think as freely about this quality as you have about the others didnt you admit that it be legitimate to infer that neither heat nor cold be in the water from the premise that the water seem warm to one hand and cold to the other i do isnt it the very same reason to infer that there be no size or shape in an object from the premise that to one eye it seem little smooth and round while to the other eye it appear big uneven and angular the very same but do the latter ever happen you can at any time find out that it do by look with one eye bare and with the other through a microscope i dont know how to maintain it yet i be reluctant to give up extension size because i see so many odd consequences follow from the concession that extension isnt in the outer object odd you say after the things you have already agree to i hope you wont be put off from anything just because it be odd but in any case wouldnt it seem very odd if the general reason that cover all the other sensible qualities didnt apply also to extension if you agree that no idea or anything like an idea can exist in an unperceiving substance then surely it follow that no shape or mode of extension or specific way of be extend that we can have any idea ofin perceive or imaginingcan be really inherent in matter whether the sensible quality be shape or sound or colour or what you will it seem impossible that any of these should subsist in something that doesnt perceive it not to mention the peculiar difficulty there must be in conceive a material substance prior to and distinct from extension to be the substratum of extension ill say more about that shortly i give up on this point for just now but i reserve the right to retract my opinion if i later discover that i be lead to it by a false step that be a right you cant be deny shape and extendedness be dispose of we proceed next to motion can a real motion in any external body be at the same time both very swift and very slow it can not isnt the speed at which a body move inversely proportional to the time it take to go any give distance thus a body that travel a mile in an hour move three time as fast as it would if it travel only a mile in three hours i agree with you and isnt time measure by the succession of ideas in our mind it be and isnt it possible that ideas should succeed one another twice as fast in your mind as they do in mine or in the mind of some kind of nonhuman spirit i agree about that consequently the same body may seem to another spirit to make its journey in half the time that it seem to you to take half be just an example any other fraction would make the point just as well that be to say accord to your view that both of the perceive motion be in the object a single body can really move both very swiftly and very slowly at the same time how be this consistent either with common sense or with what you recently agree to i have nothing to say to it now for solidity if you dont use solidity to name any sensible quality then it be irrelevant to our enquiry if you do use it to name a sensible quality the quality must be either hardness or resistance but each of these be plainly relative to our sense it be obvious that what seem hard to one animal may appear soft to another that have greater force and firmness of limbs and it be equally obvious that the resistance i feel when i press against a body be not in the body i agree that the sensation of resistance which be all you immediately perceive be not in the body but the cause of that sensation be but the cause of our sensations arent immediately perceive and therefore arent sensible i think we have settle this point i admit that we do excuse me if i seem a little embarrass i be have trouble quit my earlier view it may be a help for you to consider this point once extendedness be admit to have no existence outside the mind the same must be grant for motion solidity and gravity since obviously they all presuppose extendedness so it be superfluous to enquire into each of them separately in deny extendedness you have deny them all to have any real existence if this be right philonous i wonder why the philosophers who deny the secondary qualities any real existence should yet attribute it to the primary qualities if theres no difference between them how can this be account for it isnt my business to account for every opinion of the philosophers but there be many possible explanations one of them be that those philosophers be influence by the fact that pleasure and pain be associate with the secondary qualities rather than with the primary ones heat and cold taste and smell have something more vividly please or disagreeable than what we get from the ideas of extendedness shape and motion and since it be too visibly absurd to hold that pain or pleasure can be in an unperceiving substance men have more easily be wean from believe in the external existence of the secondary qualities than of the primary ones you will see that there be something in this if you recall the distinction you make between moderate heat and intense heat allow one a real existence outside the mind while deny it to the other but after all there be no rational basis for that distinction for surely a sensation that be neither please nor painful be just as much a sensation as one that be please or painful so neither kind should be suppose to exist in an unthinking subject it have just come into my head philonous that i have somewhere hear of a distinction between absolute and sensible extendedness grant that large and small consist merely in the relation other extend things have to the part of our own body and so arent really in the substances themselves still we dont have to say the same about absolute extendedness which be something abstract from large and small from this or that particular size and shape similarly with motion fast and slow be altogether relative to the succession of ideas in our own mind but just because those special case of motion do not exist outside the mind it doesnt follow that the same be true of the absolute motion that be abstract from them what distinguish one instance of motion or of extendedness from another isnt it something sensiblefor instance some speed or some size and shape i think so so these qualitiesnamely absolute motion and absolute extendednesswhich be strip of all sensible properties have no feature make them more specific in any way that be right that be to say they be extendedness in general and motion in general if you say so but everyone accept the maxim that every thing that exist be particular how then can motion in general or extendedness in general exist in any corporeal substance i will need time to think about that i think the point can be speedily decide without doubt you can tell whether you be able to form this or that idea in your mind now im will to let our present dispute be settle in the follow way if you can form in your thoughts a distinct abstract idea of motion or extendedness have none of those sensible qualitiesswift and slow large and small round and square and the likewhich we agree exist only in the mind then ill capitulate but if you cant it will be unreasonable for you to insist any longer on something of which you have no notion to be frank i can not can you even separate the ideas of extendedness and motion from the ideas of all the socalled secondary qualities what isnt it easy to consider extendedness and motion by themselves abstract from all other sensible qualities isnt that how the mathematicians handle them i acknowledge hylas that it be not difficult to form general proposition and reason about extendedness and motion without mention any other qualities and in that sense to treat them abstractedly i can pronounce the word motion by itself but how do it follow from this that i can form in my mind the idea of motion without an idea of body theorems about extension and shape can be prove without any mention of large or small or any other sensible quality but how do it follow from this that the mind can form and grasp an abstract idea of extension without any particular size or shape or other sensible quality mathematicians study quantity disregard any other sensible qualities that go with it on the ground that they be irrelevant to the proof but when they lay aside the word and contemplate the bare ideas i think youll find that they arent the pure abstract ideas of extendedness but what do you say about pure intellect cant abstract ideas be form by that faculty since i cant form abstract ideas at all it be clearly impossible for me to form them with help from pure intellect whatever faculty you mean that phrase to refer to set aside question about the nature of pure intellect and its spiritual object such as virtue reason god etc i can say this much that seem clearly true sensible things can only be perceive by the sense or represent by the imagination so shape and size dont belong to pure intellect because they be initially perceive through the sense if you want to be surer about this try and see if you can frame the idea of any shape abstract from all particularities of size and from other sensible qualities let me think a littlei dont find that i can well can you think it possible that something might really exist in nature when it imply a contradiction in its conception by no mean therefore since even the mind cant possibly separate the ideas of extendedness and motion from all other sensible qualities doesnt it follow that where the former exist the latter must also exist it would seem so consequently the very same arguments that you agree to be decisive against the secondary qualities need no extra help to count just as strongly against the primary qualities also besides if you trust your sense dont they convince you that all sensible qualities coexist that be that they all appear to the sense as be in the same place do your sense ever represent a motion or shape as be divest of all other visible and tangible qualities you neednt say any more about this i freely admit unless there have be some hide error or oversight in our discussion up to herethat all sensible qualities should alike be deny existence outside the mind but i fear that i may have be too free in my former concessions or overlook some fallacy in your line of argument in short i didnt take time to think as to that hylas take all the time you want to go back over our discussion you be at liberty to repair any slip you have make or to support your initial opinion by present arguments that you have so far overlook i think it be a big oversight on my part that i fail to distinguish sufficiently the object from the sensation the sensation can not exist outside the mind but it doesnt follow that the object can not either what object do you mean the object of the sense exactly so it be immediately perceive right explain to me the difference between what be immediately perceive and a sensation i take the sensation to be an act of the perceive mind beside which there be something perceive which i call the object of the act for example there be red and yellow on that tulip but the act of perceive those colour be in me only and not in the tulip what tulip be you talk about be it the one that you see the same and what do you see beside colour shape and extendedness nothing so you would say that the red and yellow be coexistent with the extension wouldnt you yes and i go further i say that they have a real existence outside the mind in some unthinking substance that the colour be really in the tulip which i see be obvious nor can it be deny that this tulip may exist independently of your mind or mine but that any immediate object of the sensesthat be any idea or combination of ideasshould exist in an unthinking substance or exterior to all mind be in itself an obvious contradiction nor can i imagine how it follow from what you say just now namely that the red and yellow be in the tulip you saw since you dont claim to see that unthinking substance you be skillful at change the subject philonous i see that you dont want me to push on in that direction so let return to your distinction between sensation and object if i understand you correctly you hold that in every perception there be two things of which one be an action of the mind and the other be not true and this action cant exist in or belong to any unthinking thing but whatever else be involve in a perception may do so that be my position so that if there be a perception without any act of the mind that perception could exist in an unthinking substance i grant that but it be impossible that there should be such a perception when be the mind say to be active when it produce put an end to or change anything can the mind produce discontinue or change anything in any way except by an act of the will it can not so the mind be to count as be active in its perceptions to the extent that volition be include in them it be when i pluck this flower i be active because i do it by a handmovement which arise from my volition so likewise in hold it up to my nose but be either of these smell no i also act when i draw air through my nose because my breathe in that manner rather than otherwise be an effect of my volition but this isnt smell either for if it be i would smell every time i breathe in that manner true smell then be a result of all this pluck hold up and breathe in it be but i dont find that my will be involve any further that be in anything other than the pluck hold up and breathe in whatever else happensincluding my perceive a smellis independent of my will and i be wholly passive with respect to it be it different in your case hylas no its just the same now consider see isnt it in your power to open your eye or keep them shut to turn them this way or that without doubt but do it similarly depend on your will that when you look at this flower you perceive white rather than some other colour when you direct your open eye towards that part of the sky can you avoid see the sun or be light or darkness the effect of your volition no certainly in these respect then you be altogether passive i be tell me now do see consist in perceive light and colour or rather in open and turn the eye the former certainly well then since in the actual perception of light and colour you be altogether passive what have become of that action that you say be an ingredient in every sensation and doesnt it follow from your own concessions that the perception of light and colourswhich doesnt involve any actioncan exist in an unperceiving substance and isnt this a plain contradiction i dont know what to think furthermore since you distinguish active and passive elements in every perception you must do it in the perception of pain but how could painhowever inactive it ispossibly exist in an unperceiving substance think about it and then tell me frankly arent light and colour taste sound etc all equally passions or sensations in the mind you may call them external object and give them in word whatever kind of existence you like but examine your own thoughts and then tell me whether i be not right i admit philonous that when i look carefully at what go on in my mind all i can find be that i be a think be that have a variety of sensations and i cant conceive how a sensation could exist in an unperceiving substance but when on the other hand i look in a different way at sensible things consider them as so many properties and qualities i find that i have to suppose a material substratum without which they cant be conceive to exist material substratum you call it tell me please which of your sense acquaint you with it it be not itself sensible only its properties and qualities be perceive by the sense i presume then that you obtain the idea of it through reflection and reason i dont claim to have any proper positive idea of it here positive mean nonrelational hylas mean that he doesnt have an idea that represent what material substance be like in itself but i conclude that it exist because qualities cant be conceive to exist without a support so it seem that you have only a relative notion of material substance you conceive it only by conceive how it relate to sensible qualities right tell me please what that relation be isnt it sufficiently express in the term substratum or substance one be latin and mean underneath layer the other come from latin mean stand under if so the word substratum should mean that it be spread under the sensible qualities true and consequently spread under extendedness i agree so in its own nature it be entirely distinct from extendedness i tell you extendedness be only a quality and matter be something that support qualities and isnt it obvious that the support thing be different from the support one so something distinct from extendedness and not include it be suppose to be the substratum of extendedness just so tell me hylas can a thing be spread without be extend isnt the idea of extendedness necessarily include in that of spread it be so anything that you suppose to be spread under something else must have in itself an extendedness distinct from the extendedness of the thing under which it be spread it must consequently every bodily substance be the substratum of extendedness must have in itself another extendedness which qualify it to be a substratum and that extendedness must also have something spread under it a subsubstratum so to speak and so on to infinity isnt this absurd in itself as well as conflict with what you have just say namely that the substratum be something distinct from extendedness and not include it yes but philonous you misunderstand me i dont mean that matter be spread in a crude literal sense under extension the word substratum be use only to express in general the same thing as substance well then let us examine the relation imply in the term substance be it not the relation of stand under qualities the very same but doesnt a thing have to be extend if it be to stand under or support another yes so isnt this supposition infect with the same absurdity as the previous one you still take things in a strict literal sense that isnt fair philonous i dont want to force any mean onto your word you be free to explain them as you please but please make me understand something by them you tell me that matter support or stand under accidents how as your legs support your body no that be the literal sense please let me know any sense literal or not literal that you understand it inhow long must i wait for an answer hylas i dont know what to say i once think i understand well enough what be mean by matter support qualities but now the more i think about it the less i understand it in short i find that i dont know anything about it so it seem that you have no idea at all either positive or relative of matter you dont know what it be in itself or what relation it have to qualities i admit it and yet you say that you couldnt conceive the real existence of qualities without conceive at the same time a material support for them i do that amount to say that when you conceive the real existence of qualities you also conceive something that you cant conceive it be wrong i admit but still i fear there be some fallacy or other let me try this it have just occur to me that we be both lead into error by your treat each quality by itself i grant that no quality can exist on its own outside the mind colour cant exist without extension nor can shape exist without some other sensible quality but as a number of qualities unite or blend together constitute an entire sensible thing there be no obstacle to suppose that such thingsthat be such collections of qualitiescan exist outside the mind be you joke hylas or do you have a very bad memory we do indeed go through all the qualities by name one after another but my argumentsor rather your concessionsnowhere tend to prove that the secondary qualities dont exist outside the mind in isolation the point be rather that secondary qualities dont exist outside the mind at all its true that existinginisolation do come up in our discussion in discuss shape and motion we conclude they couldnt exist outside the mind because it be impossible even in think to separate them from all secondary qualities so as to conceive them exist by themselves but this wasnt the only argument i use on that occasion however if you like we can set aside our whole conversation up to here count it as nothing i be will to let our whole debate be settle as follow if you can conceive it to be possible for any mixture or combination of qualities or any sensible object whatever to exist outside the mind then i will grant it actually to be so by that test the point will soon be decide what be easier than to conceive a tree or house exist by itself independently of and unperceived by any mind whatsoever i conceive them exist in that way right now tell me hylas can you see a thing which be at the same time unseen no that would be a contradiction be it not as great a contradiction to talk of conceive a thing which be unconceived it be the tree or house therefore which you think of be conceive by you how could it be otherwise and what be conceive be surely in the mind without question what be conceive be in the mind then what lead you to say that you conceive a house or tree exist independently and out of all mind whatsoever that be an oversight i admit but give me a moment to think about what lead me into it it wasi now realize after reflectionan amuse mistake as i be think of a tree in a solitary place with nobody there to see it i think that be conceive a tree as exist unperceived or unthought of overlook the fact i myself conceive it all the while but now i plainly see that all i can do be to form ideas in my own mind i can conceive in my own thoughts the idea of a tree or a house or a mountain but that be all and this be far from prove that i can conceive them exist out of the mind of all spirit you agree then that you cant conceive how any corporeal sensible thing should exist otherwise than in a mind i do and yet you will earnestly contend for the truth of something that you cant even conceive i admit that i dont know what to think but i still have doubt isnt it certain that i see things at a distance dont we perceive the star and moon for example to be a long way away isnt this i say obvious to the sense dont you in dream also perceive object like those i do and dont they then appear in the same way to be distant they do but do you conclude that the apparitions in a dream be outside the mind by no mean then you ought not to conclude that sensible object see when you be awake be outside the mind from their appearance or the manner in which you perceive them i admit that but doesnt my visual sense deceive me in those case by tell me that sensible object be at a distance when really they be not by no mean neither eyesight nor reason inform you that the idea or thing that you immediately perceive actually exist outside the mind by eyesight you know only that you be affect with certain sensations of light and colour etc and you wont say that these be outside the mind true but all the same dont you think that eyesight make some suggestion of outerness or distance when you approach a distant object do the visible size and shape keep change or do they appear the same at all distance they be in a continual change so sight doesnt suggest or in any way inform you that the visible object you immediately perceive exist at a distance or that it will be perceive when you move further forward because there be a continue series of visible object succeed each other during the whole time of your approach i agree about that but still i know on see an object what object i shall see after i have go a certain distancenever mind whether it be exactly the same object or not so something about distance be still be suggest my dear hylas just think about that a little and then tell me whether there be anything more to it that this from the ideas that you actually perceive by sight you have by experience learn to infer in accordance with the general rule of nature what other ideas you will experience after such and such a succession of time and motion upon the whole i think thats what it come down to isnt it obvious that if a man bear blind be suddenly enable to see he would start with no experience of what may be suggest by sight it be so he would not accord to you have any notion of distance link to the things he saw he would take the latter to be a new set of sensations exist only in his mind that be undeniable but to make it still more plain isnt distance a line run out from the eye it be can a line so situate be perceive by sight it can not so doesnt it follow that distance isnt strictly and immediately perceive by sight it seem so again do you think that colour be at a distance i have to acknowledge that they be only in the mind but dont colour appear to the eye as coexist at the same place as extension and shape they do then how can you conclude from the deliverances of sight that shape do exist outside the mind when you agree that colour dont the sensible appearances of both be the very same i dont know what to answer even if distance be truly and immediately perceive by the mind it still wouldnt follow that it exist out of the mind for whatever be immediately perceive be an idea and can any idea exist out of the mind it would be absurd to suppose so but tell me philonous can we perceive or know nothing except our ideas set aside what we may know through the rational deduce of cause from effect that be irrelevant to our enquiry as for the sense you be the best judge of whether you perceive anything that you dont immediately perceive and i ask you be the things you immediately perceive anything but your own sensations or ideas in the course of this conversation you have more than once declare yourself on those two point this latest question of yours seem to indicate that you have change your mind to tell you the truth philonous i think there be two kinds of object one kind perceive immediately and call ideas the other kind be real things or external object perceive by the mediation of ideas which resemble and represent them now i grant that ideas dont exist outside the mind but the second sort of object do i be sorry i didnt think of this distinction sooner it would probably have cut short your discourse be those external object perceive by sense or by some other faculty they be perceive by sense what be there anything perceive by sense that isnt immediately perceive yes philonous there isin a way for example when i look at a picture or statue of julius caesar i may be say to perceive him in a fashion though not immediately by my sense you seem to hold then that our ideas which be all that we immediately perceive be picture of external things and that the latter be also perceive by sense because they have a conformity or resemblance to our ideas that be my mean and in the same way that julius caesar in himself invisible be nevertheless perceive by sight so also real things in themselves imperceptible be perceive by sense in the very same way tell me hylas when you look at the picture of julius caesar do you see with your eye anything more than some colour and shape with a certain symmetry and composition of the whole nothing else and wouldnt a man who have never know anything about julius caesar see as much he would so he have his sight and the use of it as perfectly as you have yours i agree with you then why be your thoughts direct to the roman emperor while his be not this cant come from the sensations or ideas of sense that you perceive at that moment for you have agree that you have in that respect no advantage over the man who have never hear of julius caesar so it seem that the direction of your thoughts come from reason and memorydoesnt it it do so that example of yours doesnt show that anything be perceive by sense that isnt immediately perceive i dont deny that we can be say in a certain sense to perceive sensible things mediately by sense that be when the immediate perception of ideas by one sense suggest to the mind others perhaps belong to another sense of a kind that have often be perceive to go with ideas of the former kind for instance when i hear a coach drive along the streets all that i immediately perceive be the sound but from my past experience that such a sound be connect with a coach i be say to hear the coach still it be obvious that in truth and strictness nothing can be hear but sound and the coach in that example be not strictly perceive by sense but only suggest from experience similarly when we be say to see a redhot bar of iron the solidity and heat of the iron be not the object of sight but be suggest to the imagination by the colour and shape that be strictly perceive by that sense in short the only things that be actually and strictly perceive by any sense be the ones that would have be perceive even if we have only just acquire that sense and be use it for the first time as for other things clearly they be only suggest to the mind by past experience but to return to your comparison of imperceptible real things with caesars picture obviously if you keep to this youll have to hold that the real things that our ideas copy be perceive not by sense but by some internal faculty of the soul such as reason or memory i would be interest to know what arguments reason give you for the existence of your real things or material object or whether you remember see them formerly not as copy by your ideas but as they be in themselves or if you have hear or read of anyone else who do i can see that you want to make fun of me philonous but that will never convince me all i want be to learn from you how to come by knowledge of material things whatever we perceive be perceive either immediately by sense or mediately by reason and reflection but you have exclude sense so please show me what reason you have to believe in their existence or what mean you can possibly adopt to prove to my understand or your own that they exist to be perfectly frank philonous now that i think about it i cant find any good reason for my position but it seem pretty clear that its at least possible that such things really exist and as long as there be no absurdity in suppose them i shall continue in my belief until you bring good reason to the contrary what have it come to this that you believe in the existence of material object and that this belief be base on the mere possibility of its be true then you challenge me to bring reason against it though some people would think that the burden of proof lie with him who hold the affirmative position anyway this very thesis that you be now determine to maintain without any reason be in effect one that you havemore than once during this conversationseen good reason to give up but let us set all that aside if i understand you rightly you say our ideas dont exist outside the mind but that they be copy liken or representations of certain originals that do you have me right our ideas then be like external things they be do those external things have a stable and permanent nature independently of our sense or do they keep change as we move our body and do things with our faculties or organs of sense real things obviously have a fix and real nature which remain the same through any change in our sense or in how our body be place or how they move such change may indeed affect the ideas in our mind but it would be absurd to think they have the same effect on things exist outside the mind how then can things that be perpetually fleet and variable as our ideas be be copy or liken of any thing that be fix and constant since all sensible qualitiessize shape colour etcthat be our ideas be continually change with every alteration in the distance medium or instrument of sensation how can any fix material object be properly represent or depict by several distinct things or ideas each of which be so unlike the others or if you say that the object resemble just one of our ideas how can we distinguish that true copy from all the false ones i have to admit philonous that i be at a loss i dont know what to say to this there be more be material object in themselves perceptible or imperceptible properly and immediately nothing can be perceive but ideas all material things therefore be in themselves insensible and can be perceive only through ideas of them ideas be sensible then and their originalsthe things they be copy ofare insensible right but how can something that be sensible be like something that be insensible can a real thing in itself invisible be like a colour can a real thing that isnt audible be like a sound in a word can anything be like a sensation or idea but another sensation or idea i must admit that i think not can there possibly be any doubt about this dont you perfectly know your own ideas yes i know them perfectly for something that i dont perceive or know cant be any part of my idea well then examine your ideas and then tell me if theres anything in them that could exist outside the mind or if you can conceive anything like them exist outside the mind upon look into it i find that i cant conceive or understand how anything but an idea can be like an idea and it be most evident that no idea can exist outside the mind so youre force by your own principles to deny the reality of sensible things because you make it consist in an absolute existence outside the mind that be to say you be a downright sceptic so i have meet my target which be to show that your principles lead to scepticism for the present i be if not entirely convince at least silence i wonder what more you would require in order to be perfectly convince havent you be free to explain yourself in any way you like be any little conversational slip hold against you werent you allow to retract or reinforce anything you have previously say as best serve your purpose hasnt everything you could say be hear and examine with all the fairness imaginable in a word havent you on every point be convince out of your own mouth and if you can now discover any flaw in any of your former concessions or think of any remain tactic any new distinction shade or comment whatsoever why dont you produce it a little patience philonous i be at present so bewilder to see myself entangle and as it be imprison in the labyrinths you have lead me into that i cant be expect to find my way out on the spur of the moment you must give me time to look around me and recollect myself listenisnt that the collegebell let us go in and meet here again tomorrow morning in the mean time you can think about this mornings conversation and see if you can find any fallacy in it or invent any new mean to extricate yourself agree the second dialogue hylas i beg your pardon philonous for not meet you sooner all this morning my head be so fill with our recent conversation that i didnt notice the time of the day or indeed anything else philonous i be glad you be so focus on it i hope that if there be any mistake in your concessions or fallacies in my reason from them you will now show them to me i assure you ever since i saw you i have do nothing but search for mistake and fallacies and with that in mind i have examine in detail the whole course of yesterdays conversation but it have all be useless for the view i be lead into in the conversation seem even clearer and more obvious when i review them today and the more i think about them the more irresistibly they force my assent to them dont you think that this be a sign that they be genuine and that they proceed from nature and be in accordance with right reason truth and beauty have this in common they both show to advantage when look at closely and carefully the false glitter of error and heavy makeup cant endure be look at for too long or from too close up i admit there be a great deal in what you say and i be as convince as anyone could be of the truth of those strange consequences that you argue for yesterday so long as i keep in mind the reason that lead to them but when those arguments be out of my thoughts my mind go the other way there seem to be something so satisfactory natural and intelligible in the modern way of explain things that i confess that i dont know how to reject it i dont know what way you mean i mean the modern way of account for our sensations or ideas how do it do that it be suppose that the mind reside in some part of the brain from which the nerve originate spread out from there to all part of the body that outer object act in different ways on the senseorgans start up certain vibrations in the nerve that the nerve pass these vibrations along to the brain where the mind be locate and that the mind be variously affect with ideas accord to the various impressions or trace the vibrations make in the brain and call you this an explanation of how we be affect with ideas why not philonous have you any objection to it i need to know first whether i have rightly understand your modern hypothesis accord to it certain trace in the brain be the cause or occasion of our ideas the special mean of occasion that be at work here will be explain on page it doesnt matter in the mean time tell me please do you mean by the brain a sensible thing what else do you think i could possibly mean sensible things be all immediately perceivable and things that be immediately perceivable be ideas and these exist only in the mind this much if i be not mistake you have long since agree to i dont deny it so the brain that you speak of be a sensible thing exist only in the mind i would like to know whether you think it reasonable to suppose that one idea or thing exist in the mind occasion all the other ideas and if you do think this how do you account for the origin of that primary idea or brain itself i dont explain the origin of our ideas by the brain which be perceivable to sense because it be as you say only a combination of sensible ideas i be talk about another brain which i imagine but arent imagine things just as much in the mind as perceive things be i must admit that they be so the difference between perceive and imagine isnt important you have be account for ideas by certain motion or impressions in the brain that be by some alterations in an ideaand it doesnt matter whether it be sensible or imaginable i begin to suspect my hypothesis apart from spirit our own ideas be the only things we know or conceive so when you say that all ideas be occasion by impressions in the brain do you conceive this brain or not if you do then you talk of ideas imprint on an idea cause that same idea which be absurd if you dont conceive it you talk unintelligibly instead of form a reasonable hypothesis i can now see clearly that it be a mere dream there be nothing in it its no great loss for after all this way of explain things as you call it could never have satisfy any reasonable man what connection be there between a vibration in the nerve and sensations of sound or colour in the mind how could one possibly cause the other but i could never have see it as be so empty as it now seem to be well then be you finally satisfy that no sensible things have a real existence and that you be in truth a complete sceptic it be too plain to be deny look arent the field cover with a delightful green isnt there something in the woods and groves in the rivers and clear spring that soothe delight transport the soul at the view of the wide and deep ocean or some huge mountain whose top be lose in the cloud or of an old gloomy forest arent our mind fill with a please horror even in rock and desert isnt there an agreeable wildness it be such a sincere pleasure to see earth natural beauties doesnt she preserve and renew our enjoyment of them by intermittently draw the veil of over her face and doesnt she change her dress with the season how aptly the elements be dispose what variety and usefulness even in the lowest things that nature produce what delicacy what beauty what complexity of organization in the body of animals and plant how finely all things be suit to their particular end and also to their roles as appropriate part of the whole and while they mutually aid and support dont they also display each other in a better light raise now your thoughts from this globe of earth to all those glorious glitter object that adorn the high arch of heaven the motion and situation of the planetsarent they admirably orderly have those globes ever be know to stray in their repeat journey through pathless space doesnt each of them sweep out the same area between itself and the sun in any two equal periods of time so fix and unchanging be the laws by which the unseen author of nature run the universe how vivid and radiant be the shine of the fix star how magnificent and rich the careless profusion with which they seem to be scatter throughout the whole vault of the sky yet the telescope bring into view a new host of star that escape the naked eye here they seem to be nearby and small but a closer view through a telescope show them to be immense orb of light at various distance sink deep in the aby of space now you must call imagination to your aid so as to get some imaginative picture of things you cant actually see our feeble limit sense cant pick out innumerable worlds planets revolve round the central fire sun in each of which the energy of an allperfect mind be display in endless form so those be things you must simply imagine but neither sense nor imagination be big enough to take in the boundless extent of the universe with all its glitter furniture with all the hard work that we give to those two faculties exert and strain each of them to its utmost reach theres always a vast surplus leave ungrasped yet all the vast body that make up this mighty universe however distant they may be be by some secret mechanismsome divine power and artificelinked in a mutual dependence and interconnection with each other and with this earth which almost slip out of my thoughts get lose in the crowd of worlds isnt the whole system immense beautiful more glorious than we can say or think then how should we treat those philosophers who want to deprive these noble and delightful scenes of all reality how should we think of principles imply that all the visible beauty of the creation be a false imaginary glare to put it bluntly can you expect this scepticism of yours not to be think extravagantly absurd by all reasonable people other men may think as they please but you have nothing to reproach me with my comfort be that you be as much a sceptic as i be there hylas i beg leave to differ from you what have along agree to the premise be you now deny the conclusion and leave me to maintain by myself these paradoxes that you lead me into this surely isnt fair i deny that i agree with you in those view that lead to scepticism you indeed say that the reality of sensible things consist in an absolute existence out of the mind of spirit or distinct from their be perceive and under the guidance of this notion of reality you be oblige to deny that sensible things have any real existence that be accord to your own definition on page you declare yourself to be a sceptic but i didnt say and didnt think that the reality of sensible things should be define in that manner to me it be evident for the reason you agree to that sensible things cant exist except in a mind or spirit from this i conclude not that they have no real existence but thatseeing they dont depend on my think and have an existence distinct from be perceive by methere must be some other mind in which they exist as sure as the sensible world really exist therefore so sure be there an infinite omnipresent spirit who contain and support it what this be no more than i and all christians holdand indeed all nonchristians who believe there be a god and that he know and understand everything yes but heres the difference men commonly believe that all things be know or perceive by god because they believe in the existence of a god whereas for me the order of reason be reverse i immediately and necessarily conclude the existence of a god because all sensible things must be perceive by him as long as we all believe the same thing what do it matter how we come by that belief but we dont believe the same thing philosophers hold that god perceive all corporeal things but they attribute to such things an absolute existence independently of their be perceive by any mind whatever and i dont besides isnt there a difference between say there be a god therefore he perceive all things and say sensible things do really exist if they really exist they must be perceive by an infinite mind therefore there be an infinite mind or god this provide you with a direct and immediate proof from a most evident premise of the existence of a god theologians and philosophers have prove beyond all controversy from the beauty and usefulness of the various part of the creation that it be the workmanship of god but some of us have the advantage that we can prove the existence of an infinite mind from the bare existence of the sensible world without get help from astronomy and natural philosophy and without bring in facts about how wonderfully the part of the world relate to one another what give us this advantage be just the simple think that the sensible world be what we perceive by our various sense that nothing be perceive by the sense except ideas and that no idea and no thing of which an idea be a copy can exist otherwise than in a mind with that at your disposal you can now oppose and baffle the most strenuous advocate for atheism without any laborious search into the sciences without any sophisticate reason and without tediously long arguments this single reflection on impossibility that the visible world or any part of iteven the most lowgrade and shapeless part of itshould exist outside a mind be enough to overthrow the whole system of atheism it destroy those miserable refuges of the atheist the eternal succession of unthinking cause and effect or the chance come together of atomsthose wild fantasy of vanini hobbes and spinoza let any one of those supporters of impiety look into his own thoughts and see if he can conceive how so much as a rock a desert a chaos or a confuse jumble of atomshow anything at all either sensible or imaginablecan exist independently of a mind and he need go no further to be convince of his folly can anything be fairer than to let the disagreement be settle by the outcome of such a test leave it to the atheist himself to see if he can conceive even in think the state of affairs that he hold to be true in fact it be undeniable that there be something highly serviceable to religion in the position you be take but dont you think it look very like the view of some eminent recent philosophersnotably malebranchethat we see all things in god i would gladly know about that please explain it to me they think that because the soul or mind be immaterial it cant be unite with material things so as to perceive them in themselves but that it perceive them through its union with the substance of god because that be a spiritual substance it be purely intelligible that be capable of be the immediate object of a human mind think furthermore gods essence contain perfections correspond to each create thing and this correspondence enable those perfections to represent create things to the human mind i dont understand how our ideas which be entirely passive and inert can be or be like any part of the essence of god who be indivisible never passive always active this hypothesis be open to many other obvious objections but i shall only add that in make a create world exist otherwise than in the mind of a spirit the hypothesis of malebranche be liable to all the absurdities of the more usual view add to which it have a special absurdity all its own namely that it make the material world serve no purpose if it be valid to argue against other hypotheses in the sciences that they suppose nature or the divine wisdom to make something for no purpose or to employ tedious roundabout methods to get a result which could have be achieve much more easily and swiftly what be we to think of this hypothesis which suppose that the whole world be make for no purpose but dont you also hold that we see all things in god if im not mistake your thesis come near to that few men think but all insist on have opinions which be why mens opinions be superficial and confuse it isnt surprise that doctrines which in themselves be ever so different should nevertheless be confuse with one another by people who dont think hard about them so i shant be surprise if some men imagine that i run into the wild fantasy of malebranche though in truth i be very remote from them he build on the most abstract general ideas which i entirely disclaim he assert an absolute external world which i deny he maintain that we be deceive by our sense and dont know the real natures or the true form and shape of extend things of all which i hold the direct contrary so that overall there be no principles more fundamentally opposite than his and mine i have to say that i entirely agree with what the holy scripture say that in god we live and move and have our be but i be far from believe that we see things in his essence in the manner you have present here be my view in a nutshell it be evident that the things i perceive be my own ideas and that no idea can exist except in a mind it be equally obvious that these ideas or things perceive by meor things of which they be copiesexist independently of my mind because i know that i be not their author it be out of my power to choose what particular ideas i shall experience when i open my eye or ears so they must exist in some other mind who will that they be exhibit to me the things i immediately perceive i repeat be ideas or sensations call them what you will but how can any idea or sensation exist in or be produce by anything other than a mind or spirit that really be inconceivable and to assert something that be inconceivable be to talk nonsense isnt it without doubt on the other side it be very conceivable that ideas or sensations should exist in and be produce by a spirit because this be just what i experience daily in myself when i perceive countless ideas and by an act of my will can form a great variety of them raise them up in my imagination though i have to say that these creatures of my imagination be not as distinct strong vivid and permanent as be the ones i perceive through my sense which latter be call real things from all this i conclude that there be a mind that affect me every moment with all the sensible impressions i perceive and from the variety order and manner of these impressions i conclude that the author of them be wise powerful and good beyond anything i can comprehend please get this straight i do not sayas malebranche doesthat i see things by perceive something that represent them in the intelligible essence of god i dont even understand that what i say be this the things i perceive be know by the understand and produce by the will of an infinite spirit isnt all this very plain and evident be there anything more in it than what a little observation of our own mind and what happen in them not only enable us to conceive but also oblige us to assent to i think i understand you very clearly and i admit that the proof you give of a deity be as convince as it be surprise but grant that god be the supreme and universal cause of all things mightnt there be a third kind of thing besides spirit and ideas may we not admit a subordinate and limit cause of our ideas in a word may there not for all that be matter how often must i teach you the same thing you agree that the things immediately perceive by sense exist nowhere outside the mind but everything that be perceive by sense be perceive immediately therefore there be nothing sensible or perceivable that exist outside the mind so the matter that you still insist on be presumably mean to be something intelligiblesomething that can be discover by reason and not by the sense you be in the right pray let me know what reason your belief in matter be base on and what this matter be in your present sense of the word i find myself affect with various ideas which i know i havent cause and they couldnt cause themselves or cause one another nor could they exist on their own because they be wholly inactive transient dependent be so they have some cause other than me and other than themselves all i claim to know about this be that it be the cause of my ideas and this thing whatever it be i call matter tell me hylas be everyone free to change the current proper mean of a common word in any language for example suppose a traveller tell you that in a certain country men can pass unhurt through the fire and when he explain himself you find that he mean by fire what others call water or suppose he say that there be tree that walk on two legs mean men by the term tree would you think this reasonable no i should think it very absurd common custom be the standard of correctness in language and deliberately to speak improperly be to pervert the use of speech and cant achieve anything except to prolong and multiply dispute when there be no real difference of opinion and doesnt matter in the common current mean of the word signify an extend solid movable unthinking inactive substance it do and hasnt it be make evident that no such substance can possibly exist and even if it do exist how can something inactive be a cause and how can something unthinking be a cause of think you be free to give the word matter a mean that be contrary to its ordinary one and to tell me that you understand by matter an unextended think active be which be the cause of our ideas but this be just play with word commit the very fault that you have just now rightly condemn i dont find fault with your reason in that you infer a cause from the phenomena but i deny that the cause that reason allow you to infer can properly be call matter there be indeed something in what you say but i be afraid you dont properly grasp what i mean i wouldnt want you to take me to be deny that god or an infinite spirit be the supreme cause of all things all i be argue be that subordinate to the supreme agent or cause there be a cause of a limit and lower kind which concur in go along with the production of our ideas not by the action proper to spirit namely act of will but by the action proper to matter namely motion you keep relapse into your old explode notion of a movable and consequently extend substance exist outside the mind what have you already forget what you be convince of do you want me to repeat everything i have say about this really this isnt argue fairly still to assume the existence of something that you have so often admit not to exist but let that go i ask arent all your ideas perfectly passive and inert include no kind of action in them they be and be sensible qualities anything else but ideas how often have i agree that they be not but isnt motion a sensible quality it be consequently it be no action i agree with you and indeed it be obvious that when i move my finger it remain passive but my will that produce the motion be active now i want to know in the first place whether give that motion be not action you can conceive any action other than volition in the second place whether to say something and conceive nothing be not to talk nonsense and lastly whether have consider the premise you dont see that it be highly absurd and unreasonable to suppose that our ideas have any efficient or active cause other than spirit i give up the point entirely but although matter may not be a cause what block it from be an instrument subservient to the supreme agent in the production of our ideas an instrument you say please tell me about the shape spring wheel and motion of that instrument i dont claim to be able to do that because both this substance and its qualities be entirely unknown to me what so you think it be make up of unknown part and have unknown motion and an unknown shape i dont think it have any shape or motion at all because you have convince me that no sensible qualities can exist in an unperceiving substance but what notion can we possibly have of an instrument that have no sensible qualities not even extension i dont claim to have any notion of it and what reason do you have to think that this unknown and inconceivable something do exist be it that you think god can not act as well without it or that you find by experience that some such thing be at work when you form ideas in your own mind you be always nag me for reason for what i believe what reason do you have for not believe it for me see no reason for believe something be a sufficient reason for not believe it but set aside reason for believe you will not so much as let me know what it be you want me to believe since you say you have no sort of notion of it i beg you to consider whether it be like a philosopher or even like a man of common sense to claim to believe you know not what and you know not why hold on philonous when i tell you that matter be an instrument i dont mean absolutely nothing admittedly i dont know what the particular kind of instrument it be but still i have some notion of instrument in general which i apply to it but what if it should turn out that even the most general notion of instrument understand as mean something distinct from cause contain something that make the use of an instrument inconsistent with the divine attribute show me that and i shall give up the point i shall now do so what do you mean by the general nature or notion of instrument the general notion be make up of what be common to all particular instrument dont all instrument have this in common they be use only in do things that cant be perform by the mere act of our will thus for instance i never use an instrument to move my finger because it be do by a volition but i would use an instrument if i want to remove part of a rock or tear up a tree by the root do you agree with this or can you show any example where an instrument be use in produce an effect which immediately depend on the will of the agent i admit that i cant well then how can you suppose that an allperfect spirit on whose will all things absolutely and immediately depend would need an instrument in his operations or that he would use one if he didnt need it thus it seem to me you have to admit that it would be incompatible with the infinite perfection of god for him to use a lifeless inactive instrument such as matter be suppose to be that be your own statements oblige you to give up the point no answer to that come readily to mind there be an answer that should come to your mind you should be ready to admit to the truth when it have be fairly prove to you i shall state the proof again we be whose power be finite be force to make use of instrument and the use of an instrument show that the agent be limit by rule that be prescribe by someone else and not by him and that he can not get what he want except in suchandsuch a way and in suchandsuch condition this seem clearly to imply that the supreme unlimited agent use no tool or instrument at all an omnipotent spirit have only to will that something happen and it happen straight off without the use of any mean when mean be employ by inferior agents like you and me it isnt because of any real causal power that be in them any necessary fitness to produce the desire effect rather it be to comply with the laws of nature or those condition prescribe to us by god the first cause who be himself above all limitation or prescription whatsoever i will no longer maintain that matter be an instrument but dont take me to be give up on its existence because despite everything you have say it may still be an occasion how many shape be your matter to take how often must it be prove not to exist before you be content to let it go by all the laws of debate i be entitle to blame you for so frequently change the mean of the principal term matter but i shant press that point instead i ask you this have already deny matter to be a cause what do you mean when you affirm that it be an occasion and when you have show what you mean by occasion then please show me what reason lead you to believe there be such an occasion of our ideas as to the first point by occasion i mean an inactive unthinking be at the presence of which god cause ideas in our mind and what may be the nature of that inactive unthinking be i know nothing of its nature proceed then to the second point and give me some reason why we should believe in the existence of this inactive unthinking unknown thing when we see ideas produce in our mind in an orderly and constant manner it be natural to think they have some fix and regular occasion at the presence of which they be excite you acknowledge then that god alone be the cause of our ideas and that he cause them in the presence of those occasion that be what i think no doubt god perceive the things that you say be present to him certainly otherwise they couldnt provide him with occasion of act without insist now on your make sense of this hypothesis or on your answer all the puzzle question and difficulties that beset it i merely ask isnt the order and regularity find in the series of our ideasthat be the course of naturesufficiently explain by the wisdom and power of god doesnt it take away from gods wisdom and power to suppose that any unthinking substance influence or direct him concern what to do and when to do it even if i grant you all that you contend for regard matter as gods occasion for act would you get the result you want the point of the last question be that its hard to see how the external or absolute existence of an unthinking substance distinct from its be perceive can be infer from there be certain things perceive by the mind of god which be to him the occasion of produce ideas in us i be utterly at a loss about what to think this notion of occasion now seem to be just as groundless as the rest dont you at last see that in all these different sense of matter you have only be suppose you know not what for no reason and to no purpose i freely admit to have become less fond of my notions since you have examine them in such precise detail but still i think i have some confuse perception that there be such a thing as matter either you perceive the existence of matter immediately or you perceive it mediately if immediately please tell me by which of the sense you perceive it if mediately let me know what reason you employ to infer it from things that you do perceive immediately so much for the perception then for the matter itself i ask whether it be object substratum cause instrument or occasion you have already argue for each of these shift your notions and make matter appear first in one guise and then in another and each thing you have offer have be disapprove and reject by yourself if you have anything new to advance i would gladly hear it i think i have already offer all i have to say on those topics i be at a loss what more to urge and yet youre reluctant to part with your old prejudice but to make it easier for you to drop it i ask you to consideras well as all my other pointsthe question of how you could possibly be affect by matter if it do exist and the question of whether it would make any difference to the ideas you experienceand thus make any difference to your reason to believe in its existenceif matter didnt exist i agree that it be possible we might perceive all things just as we do now without there be any matter in the world and in answer to your first question i cant conceive how matterif there be such a thingcould produce any idea in our mind and i also admit that you have entirely satisfy me that it be impossible for there to be such a thing as matter in any of the previous sense of the term but still i cant help suppose that there be matter in some sense or other i dont claim to settle what sense that be i dont demand that you define exactly the nature of that unknown be just tell me whether it be a substance and if it be whether you can suppose a substance without qualities and if on the other hand you suppose it to have qualities please tell me what those qualities be or at least what it mean to say that matter support them we have already argue on those point i have no more to say about them but to head off any further question let me tell you that i now understand by matter neither substance nor accident think nor extend be neither cause instrument nor occasion but something entirely unknown different from all those it seem then that you include in your present notion of matter nothing but the general abstract of idea of entity or thing nothing else except that i add to this general idea of thing the negation of all those particular things qualities or ideas that i perceive imagine or in any way apprehend where please do you suppose that this unknown matter exist oh philonous now you think you have entangle me for if i say it exist in some place you will infer that it exist in the mind since we agree that place or extension exist only in the mind but i be not ashamed to admit my ignorance i dont know where it exist but i be sure it doesnt exist in a place there be a negative answer for you and such answer be all you can expect to get for all your remain question about matter since you wont tell me where it exist please inform me about how you suppose it to exist or what you mean by say that it exist it neither think nor act neither perceive nor be perceive but what positive content be there in your abstract notion of its existence when i look into it carefully i dont find that i have any positive notion or mean at all i tell you again i be not ashamed to admit my ignorance i dont know what be mean by its existence or how it exist keep up this frankness good hylas and tell me sincerely whether you can form a distinct idea of entity in general abstract from and exclude all think and corporeal be all particular things whatsoever hold on let me think a littlei confess philonous i dont find that i can at first glance i think i have some dilute and airy notion of pure entity in abstract but when i focus on it it vanish the more i think about it the more be i confirm in my wise decision to give only negative answer to your question and not to claim the slightest positive knowledge or conception of matter its where its how its entity or anything about it so when you speak of the existence of matter you have no notion in your mind none at all here be where i think we have get to please tell me if i be wrong you attribute existence outside the mind first to the immediate object of our perceptions this come from your belief in material substance then to their archetypesthe things of which they be copy then to their cause then to instrument then to occasion and lastly to something in general which on examination turn out to be nothing so matter come to nothing what do you think hylas isnt this a fair summary of your whole proceed be that as it may yet i still insist that our not be able to conceive a thing be no argument against its existence i freely grant that the existence of a thing that be not immediately perceive may reasonably be infer from a cause effect operation sign or other circumstance and that it would be absurd for any man to argue against the existence of that thing from his have no direct and positive notion of it but where there be nothing of all this where neither reason nor revelation induce us to believe in the existence of a thing we dont have even a relative notion of it what be offer be so abstract that it rise above the distinction between perceive and be perceive between spirit and idea and lastly not even the most inadequate or faint idea of it be claim to exist where all this be the case i shant indeed draw any conclusion against the reality of any notion or against the existence of anything but i shall infer that you mean nothing at all that you be use word to no purpose without any design or mean whatsoever and i leave it to you to consider how such mere jargon should be treat to be frank philonous your arguments seem in themselves unanswerable but their effect on me have not be enough to produce that total conviction that wholehearted agreement that come with demonstration rigorous knockdown proof i find myself still relapse into an obscure surmise of somethingorother that i call matter but dont you realize hylas that two things must cooperate to take away all doubt and produce a complete mental assent however clear the light be in which a visible object be set it wont be distinctly see if there be any imperfection in the vision or if the eye be not direct towards it and however solid and clearly present a demonstration be yet if there be also prejudice or wrong bias in the understand can it be expect all at once to see the truth clearly and adhere to it firmly no for that to happen time and effort be need the attention must be awaken and hold by frequent repetition of the same thingoften in the same light often in different light i have say it already and find i must still repeat it to get you to accept it when you claim to accept you dont know what for you dont know what reason and for you dont know what purpose you be take extraordinary liberties can this be parallel in any art or science any sect or profession of men or be there anything so shamelessly groundless and unreasonable to be meet with even in the lowest of common conversation but you persist in say matter may exist without know what you mean by matter or what you mean by say that it exist what make this especially surprise be the fact that its something you have just decide to say you arent lead to it by any reason at all for i challenge you to show me something in nature that need matter to explain or account for it the reality of things cant be maintain without suppose the existence of matter dont you think this be a good reason why i should be earnest in its defence the reality of things what things sensible or intelligible sensible things my glove for example that or any other thing perceive by the sense let us fix on one particular thing isnt it a sufficient evidence to me of the existence of this glove that i see it and feel it and wear it and if it isnt how could i be assure of the reality of this thing which i actually see in this place by suppose that some unknown thing which i never do or can see exist in an unknown manner in an unknown place or in no place at all how can the suppose reality of something intangible be a proof that anything tangible really exist or of something invisible that any visible thing really exist put generally how can the suppose reality of something imperceptible be a proof of the existence of a perceptible thing explain this and i shall think that nothing be too hard for you overall i be content to admit that the existence of matter be highly improbable but i dont see that it be directly and absolutely impossible even if matter be grant to be possible that doesnt give it a claim to existence any more than a golden mountain or a centaur which be also possible i admit that but still you dont deny that it be possible and something that be possible may for all you know actually exist i do deny it to be possible and i think i have prove that it isnt from premise that you have concede in the ordinary sense of the word matter be anything more imply than an extend solid shape movable substance exist outside the mind and havent you admit over and over that youve see evident reason for deny the possibility of such a substance true but that be only one sense of the term matter but isnt it the only proper genuine commonly accept sense and if matter in such a sense be prove impossible may it not be think with good ground to be absolutely impossible otherwise how could anything be prove impossible indeed how could there be any proof at all of anything to a man who feel free to unsettle and change the common mean of word i think philosophers might be allow to speak more accurately than common people do and be not always confine to the common mean of a term but the mean i have state be the common accept sense among philosophers anyway set that point aside havent i let you take matter in whatever sense you please and havent you use this privilege to the utmost extent sometimes entirely change the mean at others leave out or put into the definition of matter whatever at that moment best serve your purpose contrary to all the know rule of reason and logic and hasnt this shift unfair method of yours spin out our dispute to an unnecessary length matter have be scrutinise in each particular one of those sense and by your own admission refute in each of them and can any more be require to prove the absolute impossibility of a thing than to prove it to be impossible in every particular sense that you or anyone else understand it in i be not so thoroughly satisfy that you have prove the impossibility of matter in the last most obscure abstract and indefinite sense when be a thing show to be impossible when an inconsistency be demonstrate between the ideas contain in its definition but where there be no ideas no contradiction between ideas can be demonstrate i agree with you now consider the sense of the word matter that you have just call obscure and indefinite by your own admission it be obvious that this include no idea at all no senseexcept an unknown sense which be the same thing as none so you cant expect me to prove an inconsistency between ideas where there be no ideas or to prove the impossibility of matter take in an unknown sense that be in no sense at all i aim only to show that you mean nothing and i get you to admit that so that in all your various sense you have be show to mean nothing at all or if something then an absurdity if this isnt sufficient to prove the impossibility of a thing i wish you would tell me what be i admit that you have prove that matter be impossible nor do i see what else can be say in defence of it but when i give up matter i come to suspect all my other notions for surely none could be more seemingly evident than this once be yet it now seem as false and absurd as it previously seem true but i think we have discuss the point enough for the present i would like to spend the rest of today run over in my thoughts the various part of this mornings conversation and ill be glad to meet you again here tomorrow at about the same time ill be here the third dialogue philonous tell me hylas what have come of yesterdays meditation have it confirm you in the view you hold when we part or have it give you cause to change your opinion hylas truly my opinion be that all our opinions be equally useless and uncertain what we approve today we condemn tomorrow we make a fuss about knowledge and spend our live in the pursuit of it yet all the time alas we know nothing and i dont think we can ever know anything in this life our faculties be too narrow and too few nature certainly never intend us for speculation for the pursuit of true theories what you say we can know nothing hylas there isnt one single thing in the world whose real nature we can know be you go to tell me that i dont really know what fire or water be you may indeed know that fire appear hot and water fluid but that be merely know what sensations be produce in your own mind when fire or water be apply to your senseorgans you be utterly in the dark as to their internal constitution their true and real nature dont i know that this be a real stone that im stand on and that what i see before my eye be a real tree know no it be impossible that you or any man alive should know it all you know be that you have such and such an idea or appearance in your own mind but what do that have to do with the real tree or stone i tell you the colour shape and hardness that you perceive arent the real natures of those things or in the least like them the same may be say of all other real things or corporeal substances that make up the world none of them have in itself anything like the sensible qualities that we perceive so we shouldnt claim to affirm or know anything about them as they be in their own nature but surely hylas i can distinguish gold for example from iron how could i do that if i didnt know what either truly be believe me philonous you can only distinguish between your own ideas that yellowness that weight and other sensible qualitiesdo you think that they be really in the gold they be only relations to the sense and have no absolute existence in nature and in claim to distinguish the species of real things on the basis of the appearances in your mind you may be act as foolishly as someone who infer that two men be of a different species because their clothe be of different colour it seem then that we be fob off with the appearances of things and false appearances at that the food i eat and the clothe i wear have nothing in them that be like what i see and feel just so but isnt it strange that everyone should be thus deceive and be so foolish as to believe their sense and yet men i dont know how eat and drink and sleep and get on with their live as comfortably and conveniently as if they really know the things they have to deal with they do so but you know ordinary practical affairs dont require precise theoretical knowledge so the common people can retain their mistake and yet manage to bustle through the affairs of life but philosophers know better things you mean they know that they know nothing that be the very peak and perfection of human knowledge but be you serious about all this hylas be you really convince that you know nothing real in the world if you be go to write wouldnt you call for pen ink and paper like anyone else and wouldnt you know what it be you be call for how often must i tell you that i dont know the real nature of any single thing in the universe it be true that i sometimes use pen ink and paper but i declare positively that i dont know what any of them be in its own true nature and the same be true with regard to every other corporeal thing furthermore we be ignorant not only of the true and real nature of things but even of their existence it cant be deny that we perceive certain appearances or ideas but it cant be conclude from this that body really exist indeed now that i think about it my former concessions oblige me to declare that it be impossible that any real corporeal thing should exist in nature you amaze me be ever anything more wild and extravagant than the notions you now maintain isnt it evident that you be lead into all these extravagances by the belief in material substance thats what make you dream of those unknown natures in every thing it be what lead you to distinguish the reality of things from their sensible appearances it be to this that you be indebted for be ignorant of what everyone else know perfectly well nor be this all you be ignorant not only of the true nature of every thing but of whether any thing really exist or whether there be any true natures at all because you attribute to your material be an absolute or external existence and suppose that their reality consist in that as you be eventually force to admit that such an existence mean either a direct contradiction or nothing at all it follow that you be oblige to pull down your own hypothesis of material substance and positively to deny the real existence of any part of the universe and so you be plunge into the deepest and most deplorable scepticism that anyone ever suffer from tell me hylas isnt that what have happen yes it be material substance be no more than an hypothesis and a false and groundless one too i will no longer waste my breath defend it but whatever hypothesis you advance whatever system you introduce in place of it i be sure it will appear every bite as false if you allow me to question you about it allow me to treat you as you have me and ill lead you through as many perplexities and contradictions to the very same state of scepticism that i myself be in at present i assure you hylas i dont claim to formulate any hypothesis at all i have the common man frame of mind i be simple enough to believe my sense and to leave things as i find them heres what i think in plain word the real things be the very things i see and feel and perceive by my sense i know these and because i find that they satisfy all the need and purpose of life i have no reason to worry about any other unknown be a piece of sensible perceptible bread for instance would appease my hunger better than ten thousand time as much of that insensible unintelligible real bread you speak of it be also my opinion that colour and other sensible qualities be in the object i cant for the life of me help think that snow be white and fire hot you indeed who by snow and fire mean certain external unperceived unperceiving substances be right to deny whiten or heat to be qualities inherent in them but i who understand by snow and fire the things i see and feel be oblige to think as other folk do and as i be no sceptic about the nature of things i be not a sceptic either about their existence that a thing should be really perceive by my sense and at the same time not really exist be to me a plain contradiction since i can not abstract even in think the existence of a sensible thing from its be perceive wood stone fire water flesh iron and other such things that i name and talk about be things that i know and i wouldnt have know them if i hadnt perceive them by my sense and things perceive by the sense be immediately perceive and things that be immediately perceive be ideas and ideas cant exist outside the mind so it follow that the existence of things i perceive by my sense consist in be perceive when they be actually perceive therefore there can be no doubt about their existence away then with all that scepticism all those ridiculous philosophical doubt what a joke be it for a philosopher to question the existence of sensible things until it be prove to him from the truthfulness of god or to claim that our knowledge about this fall short of the knowledge we have of things that be obviously selfevident or rigorously prove i might as well doubt my own existence as the existence of the things that i actually see and feel not so fast philonous you say that you cant conceive how sensible things should exist outside the minddont you i do suppose you be annihilate cant you conceive it to be possible that things perceivable by sense might still exist i can but then it must be in another mind when i say that sensible things cant exist out of the mind i dont mean my mind in particular but all mind now they clearly have an existence exterior to my mind since i find by experience that they be independent of it there be therefore some other mind in which they exist during the intervals between the time when i perceive them as likewise they do before my birth and would do after my suppose annihilation and as the same be true with regard to all other finite create mind it necessarily follow that there be an omnipresent eternal mind which know and comprehend all things and let us experience them in a certain manner accord to rule that he himself have ordain and that we call the laws of nature although comprehend can mean understand here it probably mean includesall things be know by and be in the mind of god tell me philonous be all our ideas perfectly inert be or have they any agency include in them they be altogether passive and inert and isnt god an agent a be purely active i agree so an idea can not be like god or represent his nature it can not if you have no idea of the mind of god how can you conceive it to be possible that things exist in his mind that be if you have no idea of his mind how can you have any think about his mind on the other hand if you can have a think about the mind of god without have an idea of him then why cant i conceive the existence of matter without have an idea of it i acknowledge that strictly speak i have no idea either of god or any other spirit for these be active cant be represent by things that be perfectly inert as our ideas be still even though i have no idea of myself because i be a spirit or think substance i know that i exist i know this indeed as certainly as i know that my ideas exist i also know what i mean by the term i and myself and i know this immediately or intuitively though i dont perceive it as i perceive a triangle a colour or a sound the mind spirit soul be the indivisible and unextended thing that think act and perceive it be indivisible because it be unextended and it be unextended because the only extend shape movable things be ideas and something that perceive ideas and that think and will clearly cant itself be an idea ideas be inactive things that be perceive and spirit be things of a totally different sort so i deny that my soul be an idea or like an idea however my soul can be say to furnish me with an idea of god in a broad sense of the word ideathat be an image or liken of god though indeed an extremely inadequate one i get my notion of god by reflect on my own soul heighten its power and remove its imperfections my basic think of god therefore be the think of a thing that be like me except and so on so although i have no inert idea of god in my mind i do have in myself a kind of active image of him because i myself be an image liken of him and though i dont perceive him by sense still i have a notion of him which be to say that i know him by reflection and reason i immediately know my own mind and my own ideas and these give me in an indirect way a grasp of the possibility that other spirit and ideas exist further from the fact that i exist and the fact that i find that my ideas of sense arent cause by me i reason my way to the unavoidable conclusion that a god exist and that all create things exist in his mind so much for your first question by this time you can probably answer your second question for yourself i have show that there be four different ways in which things can come before the mind and none of them be a way in which matter could come before your mind i you dont perceive matter by mentally represent it as you do an inactive be or idea ii nor do you know it as you know yourself by an act of mentally attend to yourself iii you dont understand it indirectly through a resemblance between it and either your ideas or yourself and iv you dont bring it into your mind by reason from what you know immediately all of this make the case of matter widely different from that of god because your knowledge of him involve iii and iv you say that your own soul supply you with a kind of idea or image of god but you admit that strictly speak you have no idea of your soul you even assert that spirit be utterly different in kind from ideas which mean that no idea can be like a spirit which imply that there can be no idea of a spirit so you have no idea of spiritual substance yet you insist that spiritual substance exist on the other hand from your have no idea or notion of material substance you infer that material substance doesnt exist be that fair to be consistent you should either admit matter or reject spirit what do you say to this my answer fall into three part i dont deny the existence of material substance merely because i have no notion of it but because the notion of it be inconsistentto have a notion of it would involve a selfcontradiction for all i know to the contrary there may exist many things of which none of us have or can have any idea or notion whatsoever but such things must be possible ie nothing inconsistent must be include in their definition although we believe in the existence of some things that we dont perceive we oughtnt to believe that any particular thing exist without some reason for think so but i have no reason for believe in the existence of matter i have no immediate intuition of it and i cant infer itrigorously or even by probable inferencefrom my sensations ideas notions action or passions in contrast with this i undeniably know by reflection the existence of myself that be my own soul mind or source of think you will forgive me if i repeat the same things in answer to the same objections the notion or definition of material substance include an obvious inconsistency and that be not so for the notion of spirit that ideas should exist in something that doesnt perceive or be produce by something that doesnt act be inconsistent but there be no inconsistency in say that a perceive thing be the subject of ideas or that an active thing cause them i concede that the existence of other finite spirit be not immediately evident to us nor have we any way of rigorously prove it but that doesnt put such spirit on a level with material substances because there be the follow three differences it be inconsistent to suppose there be matter but not to suppose there be finite spirit there be no argument for matter while there be probable reason in favour of spirit there be no sign or symptoms that make it reasonable to believe in matter but we see sign and effect indicate that there be other finite agents like ourselves although i dont have an idea of spirit if idea be use strictly i do have a notion of it i dont perceive it as an idea or by mean of an idea but i know it by reflection on myself despite all that you have say it seem to me that accord to your own way of think and by your own principles you should conclude that you be only a system of float ideas without any substance to support them word shouldnt be use without a mean and as there be no more mean in spiritual substance than in material substance the former be to be explode as well as the latter how often must i repeat it i know or be conscious of my own existence and i know that i myself be not my ideas but something elsea think active principle here force or source of energy which perceive know will and operate on ideas i know that i one and the same self perceive both colour and sound that a colour can not perceive a sound nor a sound a colour and therefore that i be one individual thing distinct from colour and sound and for the same reason distinct from all other sensible things and inert ideas but i be not in the same way conscious of either the existence or the essence of matter on the contrary i know that nothing inconsistent can exist and that the existence of matter imply an inconsistency furthermore i know what i mean when i assert that there be a spiritual substance or support of ideas that be that a spirit know and perceive ideas but i dont know what people mean when they say that an unperceiving substance contain and support either ideas or items of which ideas be copy so there be no significant liken between spirit and matter i admit to be satisfy about this but do you seriously think that the real existence of sensible things consist in their be actually perceive if so how do it come about that all mankind distinguish between them ask the first man you meet and hell tell you that to be perceive be one thing and to exist be another i be content hylas to appeal to the common sense of the world for the truth of my view ask the gardener why he think that cherry tree over there exist in the garden and he will tell you because he see and feel itin short because he perceive it by his sense ask him why he think there be no orangetree there and he will tell you because he doesnt perceive one when he perceive something by sense he term it a real thing and say that it exist and anything that isnt perceivable he say doesnt exist yes philonous i agree that the existence of a sensible thing consist in be perceivable but not in be actually perceive and what be perceivable but an idea and can an idea exist without be actually perceive these be point long since agree between us however true your view be you must admit that it be shock and contrary to the common sense of men ask your gardener whether that tree have an existence out of his mind what answer do you think he would give you the same answer that i would give namely that it do exist out of his mind but then surely to a christian it cant be shock to say that the real tree exist outside his mind be truly know and comprehend by that be exist in the infinite mind of god probably the gardener wont at first glance be aware of the direct and immediate proof there be of thisnamely that the very existence of a tree or any other perceptible thing imply a mind that contain it but the point itself be one that he cant deny what be at issue between the materialists and me be not whether things have a real existence outside the mind of this or that person but whether they exist outside all mind have an existence that doesnt involve be perceive by god some heathens and philosophers have indeed affirm this but anyone whose notions of god be appropriate to the holy scriptures will think differently but how accord to your view do real things differ from chimeras form by the imagination or the visions of a dream since accord to you they be all equally in the mind the ideas form by the imagination be faint and indistinct also they be entirely dependent on the will but the ideas perceive by sensethat be real thingsare more vivid and clear and they dont in that way depend on our will because they be imprint on our mind by a spirit other than us so theres no danger of mix up these real things with the forego ideas form by the imagination and equally little danger of fail to distinguish them from the visions of a dream which be dim irregular and confuse and even if dream be very lively and natural they could easily be distinguish from realities by their not be coherently connect with the precede and subsequent episodes of our live in short whatever method you use to distinguish things from chimeras be obviously available to me too for any such method must i presume be base on some perceive difference and i dont want to deprive you of any one thing that you perceive but still philonous you hold that there be nothing in the world but spirit and ideas you must admit that this sound very odd i agree that the word idea not be commonly use for thing sound a little peculiar i use it because it imply a necessary relation to the mind and it be now commonly use by philosophers to stand for the immediate object of the understand but however odd the proposition may sound in word theres nothing very strange or shock in what it mean which in effect amount merely to this that there be only perceive things and perceive things or that every unthinking be be necessarilyfrom the very nature of its existenceperceived by some mind if not by any finite create mind then certainly by the infinite mind of god in whom we live and move and have our be be this as strange as to say that sensible qualities arent in the object or that we cant be sure of the existence of things or know anything of their real natures although we see and feel them and perceive them by all our sense dont we have to infer from this that there be no such things as physical or corporeal cause but that a spirit be the immediate cause of all the phenomena in nature can there be anything more extravagant than this yes there can it be infinitely more extravagant to say that an inert thing operate on the mind and an unperceiving thing cause our perceptions anyway the view that you for some reason find so extravagant be no more than the holy scriptures assert in a hundred place in them god be represent as the sole and immediate cause of all those effect that some heathens and philosophers customarily attribute to nature matter fate or some such unthinking agent there be no need for me to support this with particular citationsscripture be full of it you arent aware philonous that in make god the immediate cause of all the motion in nature you make him the author of murder sacrilege adultery and the like heinous sin in answer to that i remark first that a persons guilt be the same whether he perform an action with or without an instrument so if you think that god act through the mediation of an instrument or occasion call matter you make him the author of sin just as much as i do through my view that he be immediate agent in all those operations that common people ascribe to nature i further remark that sin or wickedness do not consist in the outward physical action or movement but in something internalthe will depart from the laws of reason and religion this be clearly so from the fact that kill an enemy in a battle or put a criminal legally to death be not think sinful although the outward act be exactly the same as in murder sin therefore doesnt consist in the physical action so make god an immediate cause of all such action isnt make him the author of sin lastly i have nowhere say that god be the only agent who produce all the motion in body true i have deny there be any agents other than spirit but this be quite consistent with assign to think rational be the use of limit power in the production of motion these power be indeed ultimately derive from god but they be immediately under the direction of the be own will and that be sufficient to entitle them to all the guilt of their action but deny matter philonous or corporeal substance there be the stick point you can never persuade me that this isnt in conflict with the universal sense of mankind if our dispute be to be settle by majority vote i be confident that you would surrender without count the vote i would like both our position to be fairly state and submit to the judgment of men who have plain common sense without the prejudice of a learn education let me be represent as one who trust his sense who think he know the things he see and feel and have no doubt about their existence and you fairly present yourself arm with all your doubt your paradoxes and your scepticism and i shall willingly accept the decision of any unbiased person to me it be obvious that spirit be the only substance in which ideas can exist and everyone agree that the object we immediately perceive be ideas and noone can deny that sensible qualities be object that we immediately perceive it be therefore evident there cant be any substratum of those qualities they can exist in a spirit not as qualities of it but as things perceive by it so i deny that there be any unthinking substratum of the object of sense and that be the mean of my denial that there be any material substance but if by material substance be mean only sensible body that which be see and felt and i dare say that unphilosophical people mean no more then i be more certain of matter existence than you or any other philosopher claim to be if there be anything that turn people in general off from the view that i support it be the mistake idea that i deny the reality of sensible things but it be you who be guilty of that not i so what they be really hostile to be your notions not mine i do therefore assertas something i be as certain of as i be of my own existencethat there be body or corporeal substances mean the things i perceive by my sense most people will agree with this and will neither think nor care about the fate of those unknown natures and essences that some men be so fond of what do you say to this since accord to you men judge the reality of things by their sense how can a man be mistake in think that the moon be a plain shin surface about a foot in diameter or that a square tower see at a distance be round or that an oar with one end in the water be crook he be mistake not with regard to the ideas he actually perceive but in what he infer from his present perceptions thus in the case of the oar what he immediately perceive by sight be certainly crook and to that extent he be right but if he infer from this that when he take the oar out of the water he will see the same crookedness or that it will affect his sense of touch as crook things usually do in that he be mistake likewise if from what he perceive in one place he infer that if he move closer to the moon or tower he will still experience similar ideas he be mistake but his mistake lie not in what he perceive immediately and at present for it be a manifest contradiction to suppose he could err about that but in the wrong judgment he make concern the ideas he think to be connect with the ones he immediately perceive or concern the ideas thatjudging by what he perceive at presenthe think would be perceive in other circumstances the case be the same with regard to the copernican system we dont perceive any motion of the earth while we be stand on it but it would be wrong to infer from this that if we be place at as great a distance from earth as we be now from the other planets we would not then perceive the earth motion i understand you and i have to admit that what you say be plausible enough still let me remind you of something tell me philonous werent you formerly as sure that matter exist as you be now that it do not i be but here lie the difference before my confidence be uncritically base on prejudice but my confidence now after enquiry rest on evidence after all it seem that our dispute be about word rather than things we agree in the thing but differ in the name it be obvious that we be affect with ideas from outside ourselves and it be equally obvious that there must be power outside the mind correspond to those ideas i dont say resemble them and as these power cant exist by themselves we have to postulate some subject of themsome thing that have the powerswhich i call matter and you call spirit this be all the difference hylas be that powerful be or subject of power extend it isnt but it have the power to cause the idea of extension in you in itself therefore it be unextended i grant it be it not also active without doubt otherwise how could we attribute power to it now let me ask you two question first do it conform to the usage of philosophers or of nonphilosophers to give the name matter to an unextended active be second isnt it ridiculously absurd to misapply name contrary to the common use of language well then let it not be call matter since you insist but some third nature distinct from matter and spirit for what reason do you have to call it spirit doesnt the notion of spirit imply that it be think as well as active and unextended my reason be as follow i want to have some notion or mean in what i say but i have no notion of any action other than volition and i cant conceive of volition as be anywhere but in a spirit so when i speak of an active be i be oblige to mean a spirit besides it be quite obvious that a thing that can impart ideas to me must have ideas in itself and if a thing have ideas surely it must be a spirit i shall state the case differently to enable you to understand the point still more clearly if that be possible i assert as you do that since we be affect from outside ourselves we must accept that there be power outside us in some be that be distinct from ourselves up to here we be in agreement but then we differ about what kind of powerful be it be i say it be spirit you say that it be matter or else some third kind of thingi dont know of what kind and nor do you here be how i prove it to be spirit from the effect i see produce i infer that there be action so there be volitions so there must be a will again the things i perceive or things they be copy from must exist outside my mind but because they be ideas neither they nor things they be copy from can exist otherwise than in an understand there be therefore an understand but will and understand constitute in the strictest sense a mind or spirit the powerful cause of my ideas be therefore something that it be strictly proper to call a spirit i suppose you think you have make the point very clear little suspect that what you propose lead directly to a contradiction it be an absurdity to imagine any imperfection in god be it not without doubt to suffer pain be an imperfection it be be we not sometimes affect with pain and discomfort by some be other than ourselves we be and havent you say that that be be a spirit and be not that spirit god i agree but you have assert that any ideas that we perceive from outside ourselves be in the mind that affect us it follow that the ideas of pain and discomfort be in god or in other word god suffer pain that be to say that there be an imperfection in the divine nature which you agree be absurd so you be catch in a plain contradiction i dont question that god know or understand all things include know what pain be he even know every sort of painful sensation and what it be for his creatures to suffer pain but i positively deny that god though he know and sometimes cause painful sensations in us can himself suffer pain we who be limit and dependent spirit be liable to sensory impressionscaused by an external agent and produce against our willsthat be sometimes painful and distress but god can not suffer anything or be affect with any painful sensation or indeed with any sensation at all because no external be can affect him he perceive nothing by sense as we do his will be absolute and independent cause all things and incapable of be thwart or resist by anything we be chain to a body that be to say our perceptions be connect with bodily motion by the law of our nature we undergo change in our mind with every alteration in the nervous part of our sensible perceptible body this sensible body be really nothing but a complex of qualities or ideas that have no existence other than through be perceive by a mind so that this connection of sensations with bodily motion come down to a mere correspondence in the order of nature between two set of ideas or immediately perceivable thingsthe set of ideas perceive by someones mind and the set constitute his body in contrast with this god be a pure spirit disengage from all such correspondences or linkages accord to laws of nature no bodily motion be accompany by sensations of pain or pleasure in his mind to know everything knowable be certainly a perfection but to endure or suffer or feel anything through the sense be an imperfection the former i repeat fit god but not the latter god know or have ideas but his ideas arent convey to him by sense as ours be what lead you to think you saw an absurdity where really there be none be your failure to attend to this obvious difference between god and his creatures there be a well establish scientific result which imply the existence of matter and you have ignore it throughout all this you havent consider the fact that the quantity of matter have be demonstrate rigorously prove to be proportional to the gravity of body and what can stand up against the force of a demonstration let me see how you demonstrate that point i lay it down for a principle that the quantities of motion in body be directly proportional to their velocities and the quantities of matter contain in them when the velocities of two body be equal therefore their quantities of motion be directly proportional to the quantity of matter in each but it have be find by experience that all body not count small inequalities arise from the resistance of the air fall with an equal velocity and so the motion of fall body and consequently their gravity which be the cause or source of that motion be proportional to the quantity of matter they contain which be what i be to demonstrate you lay it down as a selfevident principle that the quantity of motion in any body be proportional to the velocity and matter take together and this be use to prove a proposition from which the existence of matter be infer isnt this argue in a circle in the premise i only mean that the motion be proportional to the velocity jointly with the extension and solidity so i dont need to use the term matter in the premise but even if this be true it doesnt imply that gravity be proportional to matter in your philosophical sense of the word to get that conclusion you have to take it for grant in your premise that your unknown substratum or whatever else you call it be proportional to those sensible qualities velocity and quantity of motion but to suppose that be plainly assume what be to be prove i readily grant that there be size and solidity or resistance perceive by the sense and i shant dispute the claim that gravity be proportional to those qualities what i do deny be that these qualities as perceive by us or the power produce them exist in a material substratum you affirm this but despite your demonstration you havent yet prove it i shant press that point any further do you expect though to persuade me that natural scientists have be dream all through the years what become of all their hypotheses and explanations of the phenomena which presuppose the existence of matter what do you mean by the phenomena i mean the appearances that i perceive by my sense and the appearances perceive by the sensesarent they ideas i have tell you so a hundred time therefore to explain the phenomena be to show how we come to be affect with ideas in the particular manner and order in which they be imprint on our sense be it not it be now if you can prove that any scientist have explain the production of any one idea in our mind with the help of matter i shall capitulate and regard all that i have say against matter as nothing but if you cant you will get nowhere by urge the explanation of phenomena it be easy to understand that a be endow with knowledge and will should produce or display ideas but i can never understand how a be that be utterly destitute of knowledge and will could produce ideas or in any way to affect a mind even if we have some positive conception of matter know its qualities and could comprehend its existence it would still be so far from explain things that it would itself be the most inexplicable thing in the world from all this however it doesnt follow that scientists have be do nothing for by observe and reason about connections of ideas they discover the laws and methods of nature which be a useful and interest branch of knowledge all the same can it be suppose god would deceive all mankind do you imagine that he would have induce the whole world to believe in the existence of matter if there be no such thing i dont think you will affirm that every widespread opinion arise from prejudice or passion or thoughtlessness may be blame on god as the author of it we arent entitle to lay at his door an opinion of ours unless either he have show it to us by supernatural revelation or it be so evident to our natural faculties which be form and give to us by god that we couldnt possibly withhold our assent from it but where be the supernatural revelation of matter or where be the evidence that compel us to believe in it indeed what be the evidence that matter take for something distinct from what we perceive by our sense be think to exist by all mankind or indeed by any except a few philosophers who dont know what they be say your question presuppose that these point be clear when you have make them so i shall regard myself as oblige to give you another answer in the meantime let it suffice that i tell you that i dont suppose that god have deceive mankind at all but the novelty philonous the novelty there lie the danger new notions should always be discourage they unsettle mens mind and nobody know what they will lead to i cant imagine why reject a notion that have no basis in sense or in reason or in divine authority should be think to unsettle mens hold on beliefs that be ground on all or any of these i freely grant that new opinions about government and religion be dangerous and ought to be discountenance but be there any such reason why they should be discourage in philosophy make anything know that be unknown before introduce a new opinion and if all such new opinions have be forbid what a notable progress men would have make in the arts and sciences but it isnt my concern to plead for novelties and paradoxes that the qualities we perceive be not in the object that we mustnt believe our sense that we know nothing of the real nature of things and can never be assure even that they exist that real colour and sound be nothing but certain unknown shape and motion that motion be in themselves neither swift nor slow that body have absolute extensions without any particular size or shape that a stupid thoughtless and inactive thing operate on a spirit that the tiniest particle of a body contain countless extend part these be the novelties these be the strange notions which shock the genuine uncorrupted judgment of all mankind and have once be accept embarrass the mind with endless doubt and difficulties and it be against these and their like that i try to vindicate common sense it be true that in do this i may have to express myself in some roundabout ways and to use uncommon turn of speech but once my notions be thoroughly understand what be strangest in them will be find to come down merely to this it be absolutely impossible and a plain contradiction to suppose that any unthinking be should exist without be perceive by a mind and if this view be find to be strange it be a shame that it should be so in our age and in a christian country i shant question what you say about the difficulties that other opinions may be liable to but it be your business to defend your own opinion can anything be more obvious than that you support change all things into ideas yes you who be not ashamed to charge me with scepticism this be so obvious that there be no deny it you have me wrong what i support be not change things into ideas but rather ideas into things since those immediate object of perception which you say be only appearances of things be what i take to be the real things themselves things say what you like its certain that all you leave us with be the empty form of things their mere outsides that strike the sense what you call the empty form and outsides of things seem to me to be the things themselves and they arent empty or incomplete except on your supposition that matter be an essential part of all bodily things so you and i agree that we perceive only sensible form but we differ in that you maintain them to be empty appearances while i think they be real be in short you dont trust your sense i do trust mine you say that you believe your sense and you seem to congratulate yourself on agree with common people about this accord to you therefore the true nature of a thing be discover by the sense if so what be the source of the sensory disagreement that we experience why do different ways of perceivingeg sight and touchindicate different shape for the same object and if the true nature of a body can be discover by the naked eye why should a microscope enable us to know it better strictly speak hylas we dont see the same object that we feel and the object perceive through the microscope isnt the same one that be perceive by the naked eye but if every variation be think sufficient to constitute a new kind or new individual language would be make useless by the sheer number of name or by confusions amongst them therefore to avoid this and other inconvenience youll easily see what they be if you think about it men in their think and language treat as one thing a number of ideas that be observe to have some connection in nature either occur together or in sequence although the ideas be certainly distinct from one another because they be perceive through different sense or through one sense at different time or in different circumstances so when i see a thing and then proceed to examine it by my other sense im not try to understand better the same object that i have see that cant be what i be do because the object of one sense cant be perceive by the other sense and when i look through a microscope it isnt so as to perceive more clearly what i have already perceive with my bare eye because the object perceive in these two ways be quite different from one another in each case all i want be to know what ideas be connect together and the more a man know of the connection of ideas the more he be say to know of the nature of things if our ideas be variable and our sense be not always affect with the same appearanceswhat of it it doesnt follow that they arent to be trust or that they be inconsistent either with themselves or with anything else except for your preconceive notion that each name stand for i know not what single unchanged unperceivable real nature a prejudice that seem to have arise from a failure to understand the common language that people use when speak of several distinct ideas as unite into one thing by the mind there be reason to suspect that other erroneous view of the philosophers be due to the same source they found their theories not so much on notions as on word which be invent by the common people merely for convenience and efficiency in the common action of life without any regard to theories i think i follow you you hold that the ideas we perceive by our sense be not real things but image or copy of them so our knowledge be real only to the extent that our ideas be the true representations of those originals but as these suppose originals or real things be in themselves unknown we cant know how far our ideas resemble them or indeed whether they resemble them at all so we cant be sure that we have any real knowledge furthermore while the suppose real things remain unchanged our ideas keep change so they cant all be true copy of the real things and if some be and others be not we cant tell which be which this plunge us yet deeper into uncertainty again when we think about it we cant conceive how any idea or anything like an idea could have an absolute existence out of any mind from which it follow accord to your view that we cant conceive how there should be any real thing in nature because you say that real things be like ideas the result of all this be that we be hopelessly lose in scepticism now let me ask you four question first doesnt all this scepticism arise from your relate ideas to certain absolutely exist unperceived substances as their originals secondly be you inform either by sense or reason of the existence of those unknown originals and if you be not isnt it absurd to suppose that they exist thirdly when you look into it do you find that there be anything distinctly conceive or mean by the absolute or external existence of unperceiving substances lastly have consider the premise that i have put to you isnt it wisest to follow nature trust your sense lay aside all anxious thoughts about unknown natures or substances and join the common people in take the things that be perceive by the sense to be real things just now i be not incline to answer your question i would much rather see how you can answer mine arent the object perceive by one persons sense also perceivable by others who be present if there be a hundred more people here they would all see the garden the tree and flower as i see them but they dont experience in the same way the ideas that i form in my imagination doesnt this make a difference between the former sort of object and the latter i agree that it do and i have never deny that the object of sense be different from those of imagination but what would you infer from this you cant say that sensible object exist unperceived because they be perceive by many people i admit that i cant make anything of that objection of mine but it have lead me to another isnt it your opinion that all we perceive through our sense be the ideas exist in our mind it be but the idea that be in my mind cant be in yours or in any other mind so doesnt it follow from your principles that no two people can see the same thing and isnt this highly absurd if the term same be give its common mean it be certain and not at all in conflict with the principles i maintain that different persons may perceive the same thing and that the same thing or idea can exist in different mind the mean of word be assign by us and since men customarily apply the word same where no distinction or variety be perceive and i dont claim to alter their perceptions it follow that as men have sometimes say several people saw the same thing they may continue to talk like that in similar situations without deviate either from correctness of language or the truth of things but if the term same be use in a mean give to it by philosophers who claim to have an abstract notion of identity then in that sense it may or may not be possible for different people to perceive the same thingdepending on their various definitions of this notion for it isnt yet agree what that philosophical identity consist in but whether philosophers shall think fit to call a thing the same or not be of small importance i think let us suppose a group of men together all have the same faculties and consequently affect in similar ways by their sense but with no use of language there be no doubt that they would agree in their perceptions but when they come to the use of speech they might go different ways in their use of same some of them impress by the uniformness of what be perceive might speak of the same thing while others strike by the diversity of the people whose perceptions be in question might speak of different things but cant anyone see that all the dispute be about a wordnamely a dispute over whether what be perceive by different people can have the term same apply to it or suppose a house whose outer wall remain unaltered while the room be all pull down and new ones build in their place if you be to say that we still have the same house and i say it wasnt the same wouldnt we nevertheless perfectly agree in our thoughts about the house consider in itself wouldnt all the difference consist in a sound if you be to say that in that case we do differ in our notions because your idea of the house include the simple abstract idea of identity whereas mine do not i would tell you that i dont know what you mean by that abstract idea of identity and i would invite you to look into your own thoughts and make sure that you understand yourselfwhy so silent hylas arent you satisfy yet that men can dispute about identity and nonidentity without any real difference in their thoughts and opinions apart from name take this further think with you that this point still stand whether matter exist or not for the materialists themselves admit that what we immediately perceive by our sense be our own ideas so your difficultythat no two see the same thingholds as much against the materialists as against me but they suppose that an idea represent and copy an external thing and they can say truly that several people perceive the same thing mean that their ideas all copy a single external thing you earlier give up on those things that ideas be say to copy but let that pass anyway on my principles also you can suppose that ideas be copy of something external by which i mean external to ones own mind though indeed it must be suppose to exist in that mind which include all things this thingthatiscopied serve all the end of identityproviding a basis for say they perceive the same thingas well as if it exist out of a mind and i be sure you wont say that it be less intelligible than the other you have indeed clearly satisfy me that there be basically no difficulty in this point or that if there be it count equally against both opinions but something that count equally against two contradictory opinions cant be a disproof of either of them i agree but after all philonous when i consider the substance of what you say against scepticism it amount to no more than this we be sure that we really see hear feel in a word we be sure that we be affect with sensible impressions and what more should we be concern with i see this cherry i feel it i taste it and i be sure nothing can not be see or felt or taste so the cherry be not nothing and it be therefore real take away the sensations of softness moisture redness tartness and you take away the cherry since it be not a thing distinct from sensations a cherryi repeatis nothing but a heap of sensible impressions or ideas perceive by various sense these ideas be unite into one thing or have one name give to them by the mind because they be observe to accompany each other thus when the palate be affect with a certain taste the sight be affect with a red colour the sense of touch with roundness softness etc and when i see and feel and taste in certain particular ways i be sure that the cherry exist or be real because i dont think its reality be anything apart from those sensations but if by the word cherry you mean an unknown nature distinct from all those sensible qualities and by its existence you mean something distinct from its be perceive then indeed i agree that neither you nor i nor anyone else can be sure that it exist but what would you say philonous if i bring the very same reason against the existence of sensible things in a mind that you have offer against their exist in a material substratum when i see your reason ill tell you what i have to say to them be the mind extend or unextended unextended without doubt do you say the things you perceive be in your mind they be again have i not hear you speak of sensible impressions i believe you may have explain to me now philonous how there can possibly be room for all those tree and house to exist in your mind can extend things be contain in something that have no size because it be unextended and be we to imagine impressions make on a thing that have no solidity obviously not you cant say that object be in your mind as book be in your study or that things be impress or imprint on your mind as the shape of a seal be imprint on wax in what sense therefore be we to understand those expressions explain this to me if you can and i shall then be able to answer all those question you earlier put to me about my substratum come on hylas when i speak of object as exist in the mind or imprint on the sense i dont mean these in the crude literal sense as when body be say to exist in a place or a seal to make an impression on wax i mean only that the mind comprehend or perceive them and that it be affect from outside or by some be other than itself this be my explanation of your difficulty i would like to know how it can help to make intelligible your thesis of an unperceiving material substratum no if thats all there be to it i admit that i dont see what use can be make of it but be you not guilty of some misuse of language in this none at all i have merely follow what be authorize by common custom which as you know be what set the rule for language for nothing be more usual than for philosophers to speak of the immediate object of the understand as things exist in the mind and this fit with the general analogy of language most mental operations be signify by word borrow from sensible things as can be see in the term comprehend contain understand reflect bounce back look inward discourse etc when these be apply to the mind they must not be take in their crude original sense the word discourse come from latin mean run to and fro and in berkeleys day it could mean reason you have i admit satisfy me about this but there still remain one great difficulty which i dont see how you can overcome indeed it be of such importance that even if you can solve all others if you cant find a solution for this difficulty you mustnt expect to make a convert out of me let me know this mighty difficulty the scriptural account of the creation appear to me to be utterly incompatible with your notions moses tell us of a creation a creation of what of ideas no certainly but of things of real things solid corporeal substances get your principles to conform with this and i shall perhaps agree with you about them in general moses mention the sun moon and star earth and sea plant and animals i dont question that all these do really exist and be in the begin create by god if by ideas you mean fictions and fancy of the mind then the sun moon etc be no ideas if by ideas you mean immediate object of the understand or sensible things that cant exist unperceived or out of a mind then those things be ideas but it matter little whether you call them ideas or not that difference be only about a name and whether that name be retain or reject the sense the truth and reality of things continue the same in common talk the object of our sense be not call ideas but things youll have no quarrel with me if you go on call them things provide you dont attribute to them any absolute external existence so i accept that the creation be a creation of things of real things this isnt in the least inconsistent with my principles as be evident from what i have just be say and would have be evident to you without that if you hadnt forget what i so often say before as for solid corporeal substances please show where moses make any mention of them and if they should be mention by him or any other inspire writer it would still be up to you to show that in such texts those word be not use in the common mean as refer to things fall under our sense but in the philosophical mean as stand for matter or an unknown something with an absolute mindindependent existence when you have prove these point then and not till then you may bring the authority of moses into our dispute it be useless to dispute about a point that be so clear i be content to refer it to your own conscience cant you see that your view conflict in a special way with moses account of the creation if the first chapter of genesis can be give any possible sense that make it square with my principles as well as with any others then that chapter have no special conflict with mine and any such sense can be conceive by you because you believe what i believe all you can conceive apart from spirit be ideas and their existence i dont deny and you like me dont claim that they exist outside the mind please let me see any sense in which you can understand that chapter why i imagine that if i have be present at the creation i would have see things come into existencethat be become perceptiblein the order describe by moses i have always believe moses account of the creation and i dont find that my manner of believe it have alter in any way when things be say to begin or end their existence we mean this with regard not to god but to his creatures all object be eternally know by god or the same thing have an eternal existence in his mind but when things that be previously imperceptible to creatures be by a decree of god make perceptible to them then be they say to come into existence in the sense that they begin a relative existence with respect to create mind so when i read moses account of the creation i understand that the various part of the world gradually become perceivable to finite spirit that be endow with proper faculties so that when such spirit be present the things be in truth perceive by them this be the literal obvious sense suggest to me by the word of the holy scripture and in it there be no mention and no think of substratum instrument occasion or absolute existence and if you look into it i be sure you will find that most plain honest men who believe the creation never think of those things any more than i do what metaphysical sense you may understand the creation story in only you can tell but philonous you seem not to be aware of a terrific problem confront you arise from the fact that accord to you create things in the begin have only a relative existence and thus a hypothetical existence that be to say they exist if there be men to perceive them you dont allow them any actuality of absolute existence that would have enable god to create them and not take the further step of create men so dont you have to say that its plainly impossible that inanimate things be create before man be and isnt this directly contrary to moses account in answer to that i say first create be might begin to exist in the mind of other create intelligences besides men to prove any contradiction between moses account and my notions you must first show that there be no other order of finite create spirit in existence before men for my second reply let us think of the creation as it be at the end of the fourth day a collection of plant of all sort produce by an invisible power in a desert where nobody be present i say that this way of think about the creation be consistent with my principles since they deprive you of nothing sensible and nothing imaginable that it exactly suit with the common natural uncorrupted notions of mankind that it bring out the dependence of all things on god and consequently have all the good effect or influence which that important article of our faith could possibly have in make men humble thankful and resign to their creator i say furthermore that in this naked conception of things with word strip off you wont find any notion of what you call the actuality of absolute existence you may indeed raise a dust with those term and so pointlessly lengthen our dispute but i beg you to look calmly into your own thoughts and then tell me if they arent useless and unintelligible jargon i admit that i have no very clear notion annex to them but what do you say to this dont you make the existence of sensible things consist in their be in a mind and werent all things eternally in the mind of god didnt they therefore exist from all eternity accord to you how could something that be eternal be create in time can anything be clearer or better reason than this dont you also think that god know all things from eternity i do consequently they always have an existence in the divine intellect this i acknowledge by your own admission therefore nothing be new nothing begin to be in respect of the mind of god so we be agree on that point then what be we to make of the creation cant we understand it to have be entirely in respect of finite spirit on that understand of it things with regard to us can properly be say to begin their existence or be create when god decree they should become perceptible to intelligent creatures in the order and manner which he then establish and which we now call the laws of nature you may call this a relative or hypothetical existence if you please but so long as it supply us with the most natural obvious and literal sense of moses history of the creation so long as it answer all the religious end of that great article of faith in a word so long as you can assign no other sense or mean in place of it why should we reject this be it to comply with a ridiculous sceptical desire to make everything nonsense and unintelligible i be sure you cant say it be for the glory of god for even if it be possible and conceivable that the physical world should have an absolute existence outside the mind of god as well as of the mind of all create spirit how could this display either the immensity or the omniscience of the deity or the necessary and immediate dependence of all things on him wouldnt it indeed seem rather to detract from those attribute well let us look into this decree of gods that things should become perceptible isnt it clear philonous that either god carry out that decree from all eternity or at some particular time he begin to will what he hadnt actually will before but only plan to will if the former then there could be no creation or begin of existence for finite things if the latter then we must think that something new happen to god which imply a sort of change and all change point to imperfection please think what you be do isnt it obvious that this objection count equally against a creation in any sense indeed that it count against every other act of gods that we can discover by the light of nature we cant conceive any act of gods otherwise than as perform in time and have a begin god be a be of transcendent and unlimited perfections so finite spirit cant understand his nature it isnt to be expect therefore that any man whether materialist or immaterialist should have exactly correct notions of the deity his attribute and his ways of do things so if you want to infer anything against me your difficulty mustnt be draw from the inadequateness of our conceptions of the divine nature which be unavoidable on any system it must rather come from my denial of matter of which there isnt one word say or hint in what you have just object i have to agree that the only difficulties you have to clear up be ones that arise from the nonexistence of matter and be special to that thesis you be right about that but i simply cant bring myself to think there be no such special conflict between the creation and your opinion though i be not clear about where exactly it be what more do you want dont i acknowledge a twofold state of things the one copy or natural the other copiedfrom and eternal the former be create in time the latter exist from everlasting in the mind of god isnt this in harmony with what theologians generally say be anything more than this necessary in order to conceive the creation but you suspect some special conflict though you can not locate it to take away all possibility of doubt about all this just consider this one point either you cant conceive the creation on any hypothesis whatsoever in which case you have no grind for dislike or complaint against my thesis in particular or you can conceive the creation and in that case why not conceive it on my principles since that would not take away anything conceivable my principles have all along allow you the full scope of sense imagination and reason so anything that you could previously apprehend either immediately by your sense or mediately by inferences from your sense anything you could perceive imagine or understand remain still with you on my principles if therefore the notion you have of the creation by other principles be intelligible you still have it on mine if it isnt intelligible i dont think it be a notion at all and so the loss of it be no loss and indeed it seem to me quite clear that the supposition of mattersomething perfectly unknown and inconceivablecant enable us to conceive anything and i hope i dont need to prove to you that the inference from the creation be inconceivable without matter to matter exist be no good if the existence of matter doesnt make the creation conceivable i admit philonous you have almost satisfy me on this point of the creation i wonder why you arent entirely satisfy you tell me indeed of an inconsistency between moses history and immaterialism but you dont know where it lie be this reasonable hylas can you expect me to solve a difficulty without know what it be but set that aside wouldnt anyone think you be sure that the receive notions of materialists be consistent with holy scripture and so i be ought the historical part of scripture to be understand in a plain obvious sense or in a sense that be metaphysical and out of the way in the plain sense doubtless when moses speak of plant earth water etc as have be create by god dont you think that what this suggest to every unphilosophical reader be the sensible things commonly signify by those word i cant help think so and doesnt the doctrine of materialists deny a real existence to all ideas that be all things perceive by sense i have already agree to this accord to them therefore the creation be not the creation of sensible things that have only a relative existence but of certain unknown natures that have an absolute existenceso that they could exist even if there be no spirit to perceive them true isnt it evident therefore that the friends of matter destroy the plain obvious sense of moses with which their notions be utterly inconsistent and instead of it force on us i know not what something equally unintelligible to themselves and me i cant contradict you moses tell us of a creation a creation of what of unknown essences of occasion or substratums no certainly but of things that be obvious to the sense you must first reconcile this with your notions if you want me to be reconcile to them i see you can attack me with my own weapons then as to absolute existence be there ever know a more povertystricken notion than that it be something so abstract and unintelligible that you have frankly admit to be unable to conceive it much less to explain anything with its help but even if we allow that matter exist and that the notion of absolute existence be as clear as daylight have this ever be know to make the creation more credible on the contrary hasnt it provide the atheists and infidels down through the centuries with their most plausible argument against a creation this thesis a corporeal substance which have an absolute existence outside the mind of spirit be produce out of nothing by the mere will of a spirit have be see as so contrary to all reason so impossible and absurd that not only the most celebrate among the ancients but even a variety of modern and christian philosophers have think matter not to have be create at all but to have exist for ever along with god put these point together and then judge whether materialism dispose men to believe in the creation of things i admit philonous that i dont think it do this creation objection be the last one i can think of and i have to admit that you have sufficiently answer it along with the rest all that remain for me to overcome be a sort of unaccountable resistance that i find in myself towards your notions when a man be sway to one side of a question without know why dont you think that this must be the effect of prejudice which always accompany old and root notions in this respect indeed i cant deny that the belief in matter have very much the advantage over the contrary opinion in the mind of educate men i admit that that seem to be right well then as a counterbalance to this weight of prejudice let us throw into the scale the great advantage that arise from the belief in immaterialism in regard to both religion and human learn the existence of a god and the imperishable nature of the soul those great article of religion arent they prove with the clearest and most immediate evidence when i say the existence of a god i dont mean an obscure general cause of things of which we have no conception but god in the strict and proper sense of the word a be whose spirituality omnipresence providence omniscience infinite power and goodness be as conspicuous as the existence of sensible things of which despite the fallacious claim and pretend doubt of sceptics there be no more reason to doubt than of our own existence then with relation to human knowledge in natural science what intricacies what obscurities what contradictions have the belief in matter lead men into to say nothing of the numberless dispute about its extent continuity homogeneity gravity divisibility etc dont they claim to explain everything in term of body operate on body accord to the laws of motion and yet can they understand how one body might move another furthermore even if there be no difficulty in reconcile the notion of an inert be such as matter with the notion of a cause or in conceive how a quality might pass from one body to another this be one theory about how one body can move another namely by pass some motion along to it yet by all their strain thoughts and extravagant suppositions have the materialists be able to understand the mechanical production of any one animal or plant body can they through the laws of motion account for sound taste smell or colour or for the regular course of events have they through physical principles account for the intricate ways in which even the most inconsiderable part of the universe hang together if on the other hand we set aside matter and corporeal cause and admit only the effectiveness of an allperfect mind dont all the effect of nature become easy and intelligible if the phenomena be nothing but ideas the choice be obvious god be a spirit but matter be unintelligent and unperceiving if the phenomena point to an unlimited power in their cause god be active and omnipotent but matter be an inert mass if the order regularity and usefulness of the effect of nature can never be sufficiently admire god be infinitely wise and provident but matter doesnt have plan and design these surely be great advantage in physics not to mention that the belief in a distant god naturally dispose men to be slack in their moral action which they would be more cautious about if they think god to be immediately present and act on their mind without the interposition of matter or unthinking second cause then in metaphysics what difficulties concern thinghood in the abstract substantial form hylarchic principles plastic natures substance and accident principle of individuation the possibility of matter think the origin of ideas the question of how two independent substances as widely different as spirit and matter could act on each other what difficulties i say and what endless treatises concern these and countless other similar point do we escape by suppose only spirit and ideas even mathematics become much easier and clearer if we take away the absolute existence of extend things the most shock paradoxes and intricate speculations in the mathematical sciences depend on the infinite divisibility of finite extend things and that depend on the supposition of absolutely exist extend things but what need be there to insist on particular sciences isnt the opposition to all systematic knowledge whatsoeverthat frenzy of the ancient and modern scepticsbuilt on the same foundation can you produce so much as one argument against the reality of body or on behalf of that profess utter ignorance of their natures which doesnt presuppose that their reality consist in an external absolute existence once that presupposition be make the objections from the change of colour in a pigeons neck or the break appearance of an oar in the water do have weight but objections like those vanish if we dont maintain the existence of absolute external originals but place the reality of things in ideas although these ideas be fleet and changeable they be change not at random but accord to the fix order of nature for it be thatthe orderliness of our sequence of ideasthat the constancy and truth of things consist in that be what secure all the concern of life and distinguish what be real from the irregular visions of the imagination i agree with everything youve just say and must admit that nothing can incline me to embrace your opinion more than the advantage that i see come with it i be by nature lazy and this accept immaterialism would greatly simplify knowledge what doubt what hypotheses what labyrinths of confusion what field of disputation what an ocean of false learn can be avoid by that single notion of immaterialism be there now anything further to be do you may remember that you promise to accept whatever opinion appear on examination to be the most agreeable to common sense and furthest from scepticism this by your own admission be the opinion that deny matter or the absolute existence of bodily things and we have go further this opinion have be prove in several ways view from different angle pursue in its consequences and defend against all objections to it can there be a greater evidence of its truth or could it have all the mark of a true opinion and yet be false i admit that right now i be entirely satisfy in all respect but how can i be sure that i shall go on fully assent to your opinion and that no new objection or difficulty will turn up tell me hylas when in other case a point have be clearly prove do you withhold your assent on account of objections or difficulties it may be liable to when you be confront with a mathematical demonstration rigorously valid proof do you hold out against it because of the difficulties involve in the doctrine of incommensurable quantities of the angle of contact of the asymptotes to curve or the like or will you disbelieve the providence of god because there be some particular things which you dont know how to reconcile with it if there be difficulties in immaterialism there be at the same time direct and evident proof of it but for the existence of matter there isnt a single proof and there be far more numerous and insurmountable objections count against it anyway where be those mighty difficulties you insist on alas you dont know where or what they be theyre merely something that may possibly turn up in the future if this entitle you to withhold your full assent you should never assent to any proposition however free from objections it may be and however clearly and solidly demonstrate you have satisfy me philonous as armament against all future objections do bear in mind that something bear equally hard on two contradictory opinions can not be a proof against either of them so whenever any difficulty in immaterialism occur to you see if you can find a solution for it on the hypothesis of the materialists dont be deceive by word but test your own thoughts and if you dont find it easier with the help of materialism it obviously cant be an objection against immaterialism if you have follow this rule all along you would probably have spar yourself much trouble in object because none of your objections conform to the rule i challenge you to show one of your difficulties that be explain by matter indeed one that be not make even worse by suppose matter and consequently count against materialism rather than for it in each particular case you should consider whether the difficulty arise from the nonexistence of matter if it doesnt then argue from it to the falsity of immaterialism be argue from a premise to a conclusion that have nothing to do with itno better than argue from extension be infinitely divisible to god do not have foreknowledge and yet if you think back i believe you will find this to have be often if not always the case in our conversation be careful also not to argue by beg the question that be give an argument that at the outset assume the truth of the conclusion one be apt to say the unknown substances ought to be regard as real things rather than the ideas in our mind and for all we know the unthinking external substance may operate as a cause or instrument in the production of our ideas but doesnt this assume that there be such external substances and isnt this beg the question but above all things you should beware of mislead yourself by that common fallacy which be call mistake the questionthat be offer against one proposition an argument which really count only against a quite different proposition you often talk as if you think i maintain the nonexistence of sensible things whereas in truth noone can be more thoroughly assure of their existence than i be and it be you who doubtno it be you who positively denythat they exist everything that be see felt hear or in any way perceive by the sense be a real be accord to the principles i embrace but not accord to the principles that use to be yours remember that the matter you use to defend be an unknown something if indeed it can even be call a something which be completely strip of all sensible qualities and cant be perceive through the sense or grasp by the mind remember i say that your matter be not any object that be hard or soft hot or cold blue or white round or square etc for i affirm that all these things do exist though i do indeed deny that they exist in any way except by be perceive or that they exist out of all mind whatsoever think about these point consider them attentively and keep them in view otherwise you wont be clear about the state of the question and in that case your objections will always be wide of the mark and instead of count against my view they may possibly be direct as more than once they have be against yours i have to admit philonous that nothing seem to have keep me from agree with you more than this same mistake the question that you have just warn me against when you deny matter i be tempt at first glance to think that you be deny the things we see and feel but on reflection i find there be no grind for that how about keep the word matter and apply it to sensible things this could be do without any change in your view and believe me it would reconcile your view to some people who be upset more by your use of word than by your opinions with all my heart retain the word matter and apply it to the object of sense if you please but dont credit them with exist apart from be perceive i shant quarrel with you over a word matter and material substance be term introduce by philosophers and as use by them they imply a sort of independence or an existence distinct from be perceive by a mind but common people dont use these term or if they do it be to signify the immediate object of sense so one would think that so long as the name of all particular things be retain and also such term as sensible substance body and stuff the word matter would never be miss in common talk and in philosophical discourse it seem best to leave it out altogether since the use of that general confuse termmore perhaps than any other one factorhas favour and strengthen the deprave tendency of the mind towards atheism well now philonous since i be content to give up the notion of an unthinking substance exterior to the mind i think you should allow me the privilege of use the word matter as i please to signify a collection of sensible qualities exist only in the mind i freely grant that strictly speak there be no other substance than spirit but i have be accustom to the term matter for so long that i dont know how to get on without it to say there be no matter in the world be still shock to me whereas to say there be no matter if by matter be mean an unthinking substance exist outside the mind but if by matter be mean some sensible thing whose existence consist in be perceive then there be matter come across quite differently and this formulation will bring men to your notions with little difficulty for after all the controversy about matter in the strict sense of matter be not a dispute between you and ordinary folk it lie altogether between you and the philosophers whose principles be admittedly nowhere near so natural or so agreeable to the common sense of mankind and to holy scripture as yours be all our desire be direct towards gain happiness or avoid misery but what have happiness or misery joy or grief pleasure or pain to do with absolute existence or with unknown entities abstract from all relation to us it be obvious that things concern us only insofar as they be please or displease and they can please or displease only to the extent that they be perceive beyond that we be not concern and in this respect you leave things as you find them but still there be something new in this doctrine of yours it be clear to me that i dont now think with the philosophers nor do i entirely think with the common people i would like to know where i stand nowto know precisely what you have add to my former notions or alter in them i dont claim to be a setterup of new notions all im try to do be bring together and place in a clearer light a truth that use to be share between the common people and the philosophers the former be of the opinion that the things they immediately perceive be the real things and the latter that the things they immediately perceive be ideas which exist only in the mind these two notions when put together constitute the substance of what i advance for a long time i have distrust my sense i think i saw things by a dim light and through false glass now the glass be remove and a new light break in on my understand i be clearly convince that i see things as they be and be no longer trouble about their unknown natures or absolute existence this be the state i find myself in at present though indeed i dont yet fully grasp the line of argument that bring me to it you set out on the same principles that academics sceptics in ancient greece cartesians and similar sects usually do and for a long time it look as if you be advance their philosophical scepticism but in the end your conclusions be directly opposite to theirs hylas look at the water of that fountain how it be force upwards in a round column to a certain height at which it break and fall back into the basin from which it rise its ascent as well as its descent come from the same uniform law or principle of gravitation in just that way the same principles which at first view lead to scepticism then when pursue to a certain point bring men back to common sensealciphron or the minute philosopher defence of the christian religion against the so call free thinkers george berkeley content first dialogue free think and the general good second dialogue the ethics of mandeville third dialogue the ethics of shaftesbury fourth dialogue the truth of theism fifth dialogue the utility of christianity sixth dialogue the truth of christianity seventh dialogue the truth of christianity want to consider the various things that free thinker can be atheist libertine fanatic scorner critic metaphysician fatalist sceptic but you shouldn think that accord to me every individual free thinker be all of these all be say be that each item on that list characterize some freethinkers you may think that no free thinker be an atheist it have often be say that although there be admittedly some atheists who claim to be philosophical theorists no one be really an atheist as matter of philosophical theory know these things be say but be well assure that one of the most note writers against christianity in our time claim to have discover demonstration knock down proof that there be no god if you take the trouble to consult conversation and book to inform yourself about the principles and tenets of our modern free thinkers sure you ll find that every item on my list be true to life be not write only against book don think that the free think author be be misrepresent if every notion of alciphron or lysicles be not find precisely in what the author have write we can expect that man in private conversation will speak more openly than others write to improve on the hint give by author of book and draw conclusions from their principles whatever they may claim believe that all those who write either explicitly or by insinuation against the dignity freedom and immortality of the human soul can on that account be fairly accuse of unsettle the principles of morality and destroy the mean of make men rationally virtuous we can expect from that direction lot that be harmful to the interest of virtue certain admire writer have express the view that the cause of virtue be likely to suffer less from those who mock it than from those who tenderly nurse it because the nurse be apt to bundle it up too warmly and kill it with excess of care and cherish and also make it mercenary thing by talk so much of its reward leave it to you to decide whether this be fair statement of the situation the dialogues be report in long letter write to friend by fictional gentleman name dion all the name be greek his open word echo berkeley situation when compose this work he be in rhode island face the probable failure of his plan to start college in bermuda the dialogues however be locate in quietly rural part of england first dialogue monday be optimistic enough to believe that by now have be able to send you an agreeable account of the success of the plan that bring me to this remote corner of the country but all could report be the detail of how it go wrong and prefer instead to entertain you with some amuse incidents that have help to soothe me during the inevitable and unforeseeable difficulties that have encounter events be not in our power but we can always make good use even of the worst and have to admit that the way this affair go and the outcome of it give me an opportunity for reflections that help to compensate for my great loss of time and my trouble and expense mind that be free to reflect on its own process if it doesn produce anything useful to the world usually manage to entertain itself for the past several months have enjoy that kind of freedom and leisure in this distant place far from that great whirlpool of business struggle and pleasure that be call the world and my enjoyment of this peaceful place have be greatly increase by the conversation and good qualities of my host euphranor he philosopher and farmer two roles that be not so inconsistent in nature as you might think from the time he leave the university euphranor have live in this small town where he have good house with hundred acres of land adjoin it after the work he have put into improve the land it provide him with comfortable income he have good collection of book mainly old ones leave to him by clergyman uncle who bring him up and the business of his farm doesn hinder him from make good use of it he have read much and think more his health and strength of body help him not to become mentally weary he think he can carry on his study better in the field than in his study and his mind be seldom idle while he prune the tree follow the plough or look after his flock in the house of this honest friend become acquaint with wealthy and distinguish friend of euphranor name crito his anglican parish church be in our town one sunday last summer when he be din at euphranor ask after his guests whom we have see at church with him the previous sunday they be both well say crito but have drop in at the church that one time just to see what sort of congregation our parish could provide they have no further curiosity about the church and so choose to stay at home what say euphranor be they presbyterians no reply crito they be free thinkers euphranor who have never meet any member of that species or sect of men and know little of their write want to know what their principles be what system they accept that be more than can tell you say crito their writers have different opinions some go further and state their position more openly than others but the best way to learn about the current ideas of the sect be to talk with those who declare themselves to be free thinkers your curiosity could now be satisfy if you and dion would spend week at my house with these guests of mine who seem very ready to declare and propagate their opinions alciphron be in his forties and be no stranger to men or to book know him first when we be both train as lawyers in london when he come into rich inheritance he give up his law study and travel through the civilize part of europe after his return he live among the amusements of london but he begin to find them stale and insipid which throw him into sort of irritable laziness my other guest lysicles pronounce lie suh clees be near relative of mine he be quick and clever young gentleman with some general knowledge about bookish matter after he have complete his formal education and see little of the world he become friends with men of pleasure and free thinkers berkeley exact phrase which fear have greatly harm his health and his fortune but what regret most be the corruption of his mind by set of harmful principles that he win ever be cure of they have survive the passions of youth so there no chance of his lose them now these two would be agreeable enough if only they didn fancy themselves free thinkers because of this frankly speak they make it little too obvious that they think themselves wiser than the rest of the world would like it if my guests meet with their match where they least expect it in country farmer euphranor reply not offer to do more than merely inform myself about their principles and opinions so tomorrow ll assign my workers their work for week and accept your invitation if dion be will give my consent meanwhile say crito ll prepare my guests tell them that an honest neighbour would like to talk with them about their free think ll be surprise if they don like the prospect of leave convert behind them even in country village next morning euphranor rise early and spend the morning put his affairs in order after lunch we take our walk to crito which lay through half dozen pleasant field after walk for about an hour we come to crito house which stand in the middle of beautiful little park at the door we meet servant carry small basket of fruit to grove where he say his master be with his two guests we find the three of them sit in the shade and after the usual preliminaries for people meet for the first time euphranor and sit down by them we chat about the beauty of this rural scene the fine season of the year and some improvements new methods of agriculture that have be introduce recently in the adjacent county this give alciphron an open to remark that the most valuable improvements come latest wouldn be much tempt he say to live in place where men don have polish manners or cultivate mind however greatly its land have be improve realise long ago that there be gradual progress in human affairs the first care of mankind be to satisfy the crave of nature next they attend to the conveniences and comfort of life but subdue prejudice and acquire true knowledge that herculean labour come last because it require the most perfect abilities and all other advantage prepare the way for it right say euphranor alciphron have mention our true defect it have always be think that as soon as we have provide subsistence for the body our next concern should be to improve the mind but the desire for wealth step between and occupy men thoughts we re tell that think be what distinguish man from beast to which add that freedom of think make just as much difference between man and man it the noble upholders of this privilege and perfection of human kind the free thinkers mean who have spring up and multiply in recent years to whom we be indebted for all those important discoveries that ocean of light that have break in and pour through in spite of slavery and superstition euphranor who be sincere enemy to both slavery and superstition express his admiration for the good people who have save their country from be ruin by them have spread so much light and knowledge over the land he add that he like the name free thinker and approve of people be free thinkers but in his sense of the term every honest inquirer after truth in any age or country be entitle to it so what about this sect that accord to alciphron have recently spring up what be their tenets euphranor want to know what be their discoveries the ones through which they bring benefit to mankind he would be grateful if alciphron would inform him about all this that will be no trouble reply alciphron because myself be one of them and some of the most considerable free thinkers be close friends of mine and see that euphranor be listen respectfully he go on very fluently the mind of man be like piece of land what uproot plough dig and harrow be to the land be what think reflect and examine be to the human mind there right way to cultivate each land that be allow to stay waste and wild for long time will be choke with brush wood brambles thorns and other plant that be neither useful nor beautiful similarly in neglect uncultivated mind many prejudice and absurd opinions will sprout up owe their origin partly to the soil itself the passions and imperfections of the mind of man and partly to seed that happen to have be scatter there by every wind of doctrine that be raise up by the cunning of politicians the eccentricities of pedants the superstition of fool or the dishonesty of priests what can we expect the human mind to be like today after so many age of be vulnerable to the frauds of dishonest men and the follies of weak ones its prejudice and errors what strong deep root they must have what hard job it will be to tear them out but this difficult glorious work be what the modern free thinkers be undertake alciphron pause and look around his listeners indeed say very praiseworthy undertake people generally think say euphranor that it be praiseworthy to clear and subdue the earth to tame brute animals to provide nourishment for men body and cure their illnesses but what be all this in comparison to the most excellent and useful undertake of free mankind from their errors and improve and adorn their mind these days reply alciphron people be fool enough not to be able to tell their best benefactors from their worst enemies they have blind respect for those who enslave them and regard their deliverers as dangerous men who want to undermine accept principles and opinions it would be pity if such worthy and able men be to meet with any discouragement it seem to me that man who spend his time in such laborious impartial search for truth be better friend to mankind than the greatest statesman or hero the good that they do be confine to small part of the world and short period of time whereas ray of truth can enlighten the whole world and carry on into future age afraid the common herd win soon come to think like you about this but the better sort educate men with good abilities be properly respectful of those who support light and truth no doubt the clergy be always ready to help and applaud your worthy endeavour upon hear this lysicles could hardly stifle his laughter and alciphron with an air of pity tell see that you don know what these men be really like surely you must realise that of all men live the clergy be our greatest enemies they would if they could extinguish the light of nature itself turn the world into dungeon and keep mankind for ever in chain and darkness never imagine anything like this of our protestant clergy particularly the anglican ones whom would have expect go by what have see of them and their write to be lovers of learn and useful knowledge believe me priests of all religions be the same where there be priests there will be priestcraft and where there be priestcraft there will be persecute spirit you can depend on them to exercise their full persecutory power against anyone who have the courage to think for himself and who refuse to be hoodwink and shackle by his reverend leaders those great master of hair split and jargon have fabricate various systems which this be add sarcastically be all equally true and equally important for the world everyone be wed to his own sect and furiously attack all those who disagree with it the next sentence speak of the magistrate term that will occur several more time in these dialogues it be kind of short hand for judge and anyone else who be involve in the enforcement of the law of the land sometimes as on page it seem to cover also law makers the chief vices of priests and churchmen all over the world be cruelty and ambition so they do their best to get the upper hand over the rest of mankind and the magistrate have joint interest with the priest in subdue confuse and scar the people too often lend hand to the church authorities who always think that their authority and possessions aren safe until those whose opinions be different from their own be deprive of their right include the right belong to their social status and even their right as human be picture to yourselves monster or ghost make up of superstition and fanaticism the offspring of statecraft and priestcraft rattle chain in one hand and with the other brandish flame sword over the land and threaten destruction to all who dare to follow the dictate of reason and common sense just think about this and then say if our undertake isn dangerous as well as difficult and yet because of the noble ardour that truth inspire our free thinkers be neither overcome by the difficulty nor daunt by the danger in spite of both we have already make so many convert among people of the better sort that we hope to be able eventually to carry all before us beat down the wall of secular and ecclesiastical tyranny break the fetter and chain of our countrymen and restore the original inherent right liberties and privilege of mankind have say all this in highly emotional way alciphron pause to get his breath back but nobody answer him euphranor be star at him mouth open so alciphron go on turn to euphranor he speak less excitedly the more innocent and honest man be the more vulnerable he be to be take in by the plausible claim of other men you have probably encounter write by our theologians that discuss grace virtue goodness and such matter write that be fit to confuse and deceive simple honest mind but however much they may whitewash their design they be all basically engage in the same selfish project don deny that among the theologians there may be here and there poor half witted man who mean no harm but don hesitate to say that all the men of sense among them be fundamentally drive by ambition avarice and vengefulness while alciphron be speak servant come to tell him and lysicles that some men who be about to set off for london be wait to receive their order so they both get up and go towards the house as soon as they be go euphranor remark to crito that he think the poor gentleman must have be make to suffer greatly because of his free think because he seem to speak with the passion and resentment natural to men who have be treat very badly don believe it answer crito in members of his sect free thinkers have often notice two conversational fault namely high fly rhetoric and tease depend on whether their mood of the moment be tragic or comic sometimes they work themselves into high passions and be then frighten by the ghost they have create when they be have one of those fit every assistant parson of little country church be see as an inquisitor at other time they adopt sly joke manner use hint and allusions say little but insinuate much and over all seem to amuse themselves at the expense of the subject and of their adversaries if you want to know what they really believe you ll have to get them to speak up and not to ramble off the topic they tend to go on about be persecute for free think but they have no good reason for this because everyone be perfectly free to think what he please don know of any persecution in england for opinion intellectual attitude or think but suppose that in every country some care be take to restrain obscene speech and to discourage an outward contempt for what the public hold sacred whatever the person inward thoughts may be whether this care in england have recently become so excessive as to distress the subject of this formerly free and easy government whether the free thinkers can fairly complain of any hardship suffer because of conscience or opinion you ll be better place to judge when you hear their account of the number progress and notions of their sect sure they will tell you all this fully and freely provide nobody present seem shock or offend for in that case they may tone things down out of sheer good manners be never angry with any man for his opinion say euphranor whether he jew turk or idol worshipper he can speak his mind freely to me without fear of offend would even be glad to hear what he have to say provide he say it in an honest open manner whoever dig in the mine of truth be my fellow labourer think but if while be try hard he amuse himself by tease me and fling dust in my eye ll soon be tire of him in the meantime alciphron and lysicles have settle their bite of business return to us lysicles sit down in the same place as before but alciphron stand in front of us with his arm fold and his head lean on his leave shoulder in the posture of man meditate we sit silent so as not to disturb his thoughts and after two or three minutes he say oh truth oh liberty after which he go on muse at this point euphranor venture to interrupt him alciphron he say it isn fair to spend your time in silent soliloquies in this corner of the world we don often get chance to have conversation with learn and well inform men and the opportunity you have put into my hand be too valuable for me not to make the best use of it be you then sincere devotee of truth and can you stand the freedom of fair inquiry that what want more than anything what on every subject on the notions that you first take in with your mother milk and that have ever since be feed to you by other nurse parent pastors tutor religious assemblies book of devotion and other such devices for take hold of men mind love information on all subject that come my way and especially on those that be most important well then if you be in earnest stay fair and stand firm while probe your prejudice and wipe out your principles while pull from your heart your hoary old wive tales he say this in latin quote the poet persius whereupon alciphron frown pause and then launch forth if we take the trouble to dig down to the bottom of things and analyse the basic principles on which opinions rest we ll find that the opinions that be think to be the most important have the flimsiest base be derive either from the casual customs of the country where we live or from indoctrination that we be subject to before we could tell right from wrong true from false alciphron be about the speak of the vulgar and to say what he mean by that word broadly speak its sense at that time be common ordinary run of the mill not very educate not possess of serious intellectual interest something along those line it didn have the sense of rude crude bad mannered or the like in the present work vulgar be sometimes use as term of disdain or condescension to refer to people who wouldn have count as vulgar be the sober strictly literal sense of the word the vulgar mean all the people who don make free use of their reason tend to regard these prejudice as sacred and unquestionable believe them to be imprint on the hearts of men by god himself or convey by revelation from heaven or so intrinsically clear and evident that one can help accept them without any inquiry or examination in this way the shallow vulgar have their head full of fancy principles and doctrines religious moral and political all of which they maintain with level of energy that be proportional to their lack of reason on the other hand those who properly use their faculties in the search for truth be especially careful to weed out of their mind any notions or prejudice that be plant in them before they be old enough to use reason freely and completely our modern free thinkers have actually do this as well as shrewdly dissect the generally accept systems of belief they have trace every establish prejudice to its source the real reason why people believe what they believe and in the course of do this and get comprehensive overview of the various part and age of the world they have be able to observe an amaze variety of customs and rites of religious and civil institutions of ideas and beliefs that be very unlike and even contrary to one another which conclusively show that they can all be true yet each of them be maintain by its supporters with the same air of confidence the same energetic earnestness and when they be examine they all turn out to have the very same foundation namely the strength of prejudice with the help of these observations and discoveries they have break the chain of popular custom and have free themselves from fraud they now generously lend hand to their fellow subject to lead them into the same paths of light and liberty that be quick summary of the view and project of the so call free thinkers if anything that have say or anything ll say later be contrary to your preconceive opinions and therefore shock and disagreeable to you you ll pardon the openness and plainness of philosopher and remember that whenever displease you in that way be do it out of respect for the truth and obedience to your own command well aware that eye long keep in the dark can bear sudden view of noonday light and must be bring to it by degrees for that reason the able free thinkers proceed gradually start with the prejudice to which men be least attach and then move on to undermine the rest by slow and imperceptible degrees till they have demolish the whole fabric of human folly and superstition but don have time here to come at things in that roundabout way ll have to proceed directly and plainly more so perhaps than will be think prudent and well mannered we assure him he be entirely free to speak his mind concern things persons and opinions without hold anything back that be freedom alciphron reply that we freethinkers be as will to give as we be to take it we like to call things by their right name and we can bear have truth suffer because people politely let falsehoods pass without challenge so let us settle this in advance no one will take offence at anything whatsoever that be say on either side we agree to this well then say alciphron let us start our pursuit of the truth by suppose that have be bring up in let say the church of england the anglican church when reach maturity of judgment and think about the particular form of worship and opinions of this church don remember when or how they first take possession of my mind as look back find them to have be in my mind for as far back as my memory of anything stretch then look at the upbringing of children as basis for judgment about how my own upbringing go see them be instruct in religious matter before they can reason about them so that all such instruction be nothing but fill the tender mind of child with prejudice this lead me to reject all those religious ideas regard them as on par with the other follies of my childhood be confirm in this attitude when widen my view and see roman catholics and various sects of protestants which all agree in general profession of belief in christ but differ vastly one from another regard detail of faith and worship then widen my view still further so as to take in jews and moslems see that they agree little with christians in that they all believe in one god but each of these religions have its own special laws and revelations for which it express the same respect as the others have for their laws and revelations look further afield still to examine heathen and idolatrous nations discover an endless variety not only in detail of doctrine and form of worship but even in the very notion of god in which they differ widely from one another and from all the other sects have mention the bottom line be that instead of simple and uniform truth see nothing but discord opposition and wild claim all spring up from the prejudice of upbringing from reflect on and think about these facts thoughtful men have conclude that all religions be false be fables the reason why one man be christian another jew third moslem fourth heathen idolater be that each happen to be bring up in that particular sect so just as each of these contend party condemn the rest so an unprejudiced bystander will condemn and reject them en bloc see that they all originate from the same error rich source and be keep go by the same techniques to meet the same purpose of the priest and the magistrate see note on page so you think that the magistrate go along with the priest in mislead the people do and so must everyone who consider things in true light for you must know that the magistrate main aim be to keep the people under him in awe now the public eye restrain men from open offences against the laws and government but to prevent secret crimes magistrate find it expedient that men should believe that god eye be watch over their private action and design and to intimidate those who might otherwise be draw into crimes by the prospect of pleasure and profit he tell them that whoever escape punishment in this life will be sure to find it in the after life where it will be so heavy and long last that it infinitely outweigh any pleasure or profit that he get from his crimes so it have come about that the beliefs that there be god the soul be immortal and there be future state of reward and punishments have be value as useful engines of government these be rather notional airy doctrines and the rulers need them to impress themselves on people sense and to be retain in their mind and so the rulers of the various civilize nations of the earth have skillfully devise temples sacrifice church rites ceremonies clerical clothe music prayer preach and other such spiritual foolery all of which help the priest to prosper in his career and satisfy the magistrate by frighten and subdue the people that the source of the alliance between church and state religion establish by law and the right immunities and incomes of priests all over the world every government want you to fear god so that you ll honour the king or civil power crito and hear this speech of alciphron with the utmost attention but without look surprise and indeed for us there be nothing new or unexpected in it but euphranor who have never before be present at such conversation couldn help show some astonishment and lysicles who notice it ask him brightly how he like alciphron lecture think it the first you ever hear of that kind he say and you ll have need strong stomach to digest it admit that don have the quickest digestion but it have sometimes gradually be able to assimilate things that at first seem indigestible right now admire alciphron free spirit and eloquence but frankly astonish by his opinions rather than convince of their truth what he say turn to alciphron can you really not believe in the existence of god to be plain with you do not but this be what think would happen flood of light let in on the mind all at once be more likely to dazzle and disorder the mind than to enlighten it if weren short of time would have begin in the regular way first describe the feature of religion that aren essential to it then attack the mysteries of christianity after that proceed to what christianity teach about conduct and finally wipe out the belief in god this last be the first teach of all the religious prejudice and the basis of the rest so that it have take the deepest root in our mind not surprise that you still have this belief this prejudice because have know number of very able men who have trouble free themselves from it not everyone have the same speed and energy of think as you do for one find it hard to keep up with you to help you ll go back little and pick up the thread of my reason first must tell you that have think hard about the idea of truth have find truth to be stable permanent and uniform not various and changeable like modes or fashion or matter of taste in the next place have observe many sects and splinter from sects adopt very different and contrary opinions while all profess christianity reject any doctrine on which they didn all agree and keep only the one that be agree to by all and so become latitudinarian roughly someone who be christian in broad sense with no interest in the detail of doctrine church government form of worship etc that divide branch of christianity from one another after go on to attend to more of the facts saw that christians jews and moslems have their different systems of faith agree only in the belief that there be one god and so become deist roughly someone who reject miracles revelation anything supernatural and have no interest in any organize church or form of worship but believe that natural evidence point to there be god lastly extend my view to all the many nations that inhabit this globe and find that they didn agree with one another or with any of the sects have mention on any point of faith not even on the notion of god so become an atheist because think that man of courage and good sense should follow his argument wherever it lead him and that nothing be more ridiculous than to be free thinker by halve approve of the man who do the job thoroughly not merely lop off the branch but pull up the root from which they grow regard this next bite the grand arcanum be the mythical philosopher stone which be repute to transform lead into gold and or perform other wonder alciphron ironical use of the term may be mean to indicate that atheism transform large part of one beliefsystem in berkeley day call someone genius be stronger than merely call him clever but have less force than genius do in our day so you see that atheism which frighten women and fool be the very peak and perfection of free think it be the grand arcanum to which true genius naturally rise perhaps gradually perhaps as sudden intellectual break through and without it he can never have absolute freedom and peace in his soul to become thoroughly convince about this central point just examine the notion of god with the same freedom that you would examine any other prejudice track it back to its source and you win find that you acquire it through any of your sense though these be in fact the only true mean of discover what be real and substantial in nature you ll find it lie among other old lumber in some obscure corner of your imagination the proper dump grind for visions fancy and prejudice of all kinds and if you be more attach to this bite of lumber than you be to the rest that only because it be the oldest that be all take my word for it and not just mine but that of many of the ablest men of our time whose view about god be the same as mine they really be though some of these people think they should go more gently in declare to the world their opinion on this matter than on most others and have to admit that in england there be still too many people who retain foolish prejudice against the label atheist but that be lessen every day among people of the better sort and when it the prejudice against the word atheist have fade to nothing our free thinkers can then at last be say to have give the death blow to religion because it obvious that so long as people think that god exist religion must survive in some shape or other but once the root have be pluck up all its offspring will wither and decay as matter of course the offspring talk about be all those whimsical notions of conscience duty principle and the like which fill man head with worry awe him with fear and make him more thoroughly slave than be the horse he rid it thousand time better to be hunt by debt collectors or bailiffs with subpoena than to be haunt by these spectres of conscience etc which trouble and embitter all his pleasures create the most real and severe slavery on earth but the free thinker with vigorous flight of think break through those airy trap and assert his basic independence others may talk and write and fight about liberty and outwardly claim to have it but only the free thinker be truly free when alciphron end this speech with an air of triumph euphranor say to him you make clear work it seem that the gentlemen who believe as you do be admirable weeders you have root up world of notions now show me what fine things you have plant in place of them be patient euphranor ll show you first that we leave untouched whatever be sound and good encourage it to grow in the mind of man and secondly ll show you what excellent things we have plant there push on with our close and severe scrutiny we eventually arrive at something solid and real on which all mankind agree namely the appetites passions and sense these be root in nature be real have real object and bring with them real and substantial pleasures food drink sleep and other such animal enjoyments be what all men like and love and if we extend our view to the other kinds of animals we ll find that they all have certain natural appetites and sense which they be constantly engage in gratify and satisfy we be so far from destroy these real natural good things which have nothing notional or fanciful about them that we do our best to cherish and improve them accord to us every wise man regard himself his own bodily existence in this present world as the centre and ultimate end of all his action and concern he regard his appetites as natural guide that will direct him to his proper good and regard his passions and sense as the natural true mean of enjoy this good so he try to keep his appetites alert and his passions and sense strong and lively and work very hard in every possible way to provide the greatest quantity and variety of real object suit to them man who can do this without restraint remorse or fear be as happy as any other animal whatsoever as happy as his nature be capable of be there have give you condense view of the principles discoveries and beliefs of the select spirit here the best mind of this enlighten age after polite little to and fro about the need for open frankness on both side the discussion continue be half ashamed say euphranor to admit that have weakness that lesser mind be prone to no great genius have favourite opinions that you represent as errors and prejudice for instance the immortality of the soul be notion fond of because it support the mind with very please prospect if it be wrong might side with cicero who say that in that case he would be sorry to know the truth and speak of certain philosophers of his time who teach that the human soul be mortal say that he have nothing to thank them for those philosophers seem to have be predecessors of those who be now call free thinkers euphranor go on to remark that free thinker be too general name and that he have no objection to think freely he propose that the sect be give the name that cicero give them with all my heart what name be it why he call them minute philosophers this be minute small not second euphranor point be of course not that these philosophers be small but that they represent valuable things as small or of small importance alciphron will soon suggest different mean for the label right say crito the modern free thinkers be just like the ones that cicero call minute philosophers it an excellent name for them because they diminish all the most valuable things the thoughts view and hop of men they reduce all the knowledge ideas and theories that men have to sense they shrink and downgrade human nature to the narrow low standard of animal life and they assign to us only small pittance of time instead of immortality alciphron very gravely remark that the gentlemen of his sect have not insult man and that if man be little short live negligible animal it wasn their say it that make him so and they be no more to blame for whatever defect they reveal in themselves than good mirror be to blame for make the wrinkle that it show as for your remark that those we now call free thinkers be in ancient time call minute philosophers suggest that this label may have come from their consider things minutely rather than swallow them in great lump as other men usually do anyway we all know that the best eye be necessary to pick out the minutest object so it seem that minute philosophers might have be so call because they be so sharp sight alciphron these minute philosophers that be the right name for them be like pirate who plunder everything that come in their way feel like man who have be leave strip and desolate on bleak beach but who be these profound and learn men that in recent years have demolish the whole fabric that lawgivers philosophers and theologians have be erect for so many age lysicles smile say he believe euphranor be imagine philosophers in square cap and long gown and that in these happy time the reign of pedantry be over our philosophers he say be very different from the awkward students who try to get knowledge by pore over dead languages and ancient author or by shut themselves off from the care of the world to meditate in solitude they be the best breed men of the age men who know the world men of pleasure men of fashion and fine gentlemen have some idea of the people you re talk about but would never have take them for philosophers nor would anyone else until quite recently it seem that for centuries everyone mistakenly think that the way to knowledge be through tedious course of academic education and study but one of the chief discoveries of the present time be that such method slow down and block knowledge rather than promote it crito be of course speak sarcastically he doesn actually side with the minute philosophers he will keep up this tone until page where he will come into the open his open attack on the minute philosophy in the second dialogue be the most rhetorically vivid and passionate things that berkeley ever write there be two strand in academic study read and think what the students mainly read be ancient author in dead languages so that much of their time be spend in learn word which once they ve be laboriously master reward the scholar with old and obsolete ideas that be now quite explode and abandon as for their think what good can possibly come of it if someone doesn have the right materials to think about he can think and meditate for ever without get anywhere those cobwebs that scholars spin out of their own brain be neither useful nor beautiful there only one way to get proper ideas or materials of think and that be by keep good company know several gentlemen who since their appearance in the world the non academic world or perhaps more narrowly the world of high society and fashion have spend as much time rub off the rust and pedantry of college education as they have first spend acquire it ll bet that fourteen year old who be bring up in the modern way will make better show and be more admire in any draw room or assembly of cultivate people than twenty four year old who have set aside long time for study at school and college he ll say better things in better manner and be more like by good judge where do he pick up all this improvement where our solemn ancestors would never have look for it in draw room coffee house tavern gamble den in fashionable place like these it the custom for cultivate persons to speak freely on all subject religious moral or political so that young gentleman who spend much time in them be in position to hear many instructive lecture spice with wit and tease and utter with energy three or four well deliver sentence from man of quality make more of an impression and convey more knowledge than dozen dry academic lecture so there no method no set course of study in those place none but an easy free conversation which take up every topic that anyone offer without any rule or design always think that to get any useful amount of knowledge one need some order in one study that haste and confusion create self satisfy ignorance that our advance can be secure unless they be gradual and that one should start by learn things that might cast light on what be to follow so long as learn could be obtain only by that slow formal course of study few of the better people know much of it but now that learn have grow into pastime our young gentry and nobility unknowingly absorb it during their other pastimes and make considerable progress that presumably why there be so many minute philosophers crito resume his sarcastic pretend admiration for the minute philosophers then it would seem then that method exactness and hard work be positive disadvantage here alciphron turn to lysicles say he could make the point very clear if euphranor have any notion of paint never saw first rate picture in my life but have pretty good collection of print and have see some good draw so you know the difference between the dutch and the italian manner have some idea of it well then compare draw do by the exact and laborious touch of dutch pencil with draw casually dash off in the free manner of great italian master the dutch piece which have take so much trouble and time will indeed be exact but it win have the force spirit or grace that appear in the italian draw and be the effect of an easy free pencil apply this example to our discussion and you ll get my point tell me do those great italian master begin and continue in their art without any choice of method or subject and always draw with the same ease and freedom or do they conform to some method begin with simple and elementary part an eye nose finger which they draw with great effort and care often draw the same thing over and over again so as to get it right and so gradually acquire through patience and hard work through many years the free masterly manner you speak of if the latter be right leave you to apply the example to our discussion so that you will get my point dispute the matter if you like but man of many talents be one thing and pedant be another hard methodical work may do for some kinds of people it take long time to ignite wet straw and when you do you get vile smother flame whereas spirit blaze out at once the minute philosophers have it seem better talents than other men which qualify them for different education tell me euphranor what do one man get to look good in way that others don what cause him to be more polish in how he dress how he speak and how he move nothing but keep good company that be also how men gradually and unconsciously get delicate taste refine judgment certain polish in think and express themselves it not surprise that you folk who live out in the country aren acquaint with the advantage of elegant conversation which constantly keep the mind awake and active make use of its abilities and demand all its strength and spirit on thousand different occasion and on subject that never come in the way of book worm in college any more than ploughman hence the lively faculties quickness of uptake slyness of ridicule and enormous talent of wit and humour that distinguish the gentlemen who believe as you do it should seem then that your sect be make up of what you call fine gentlemen not altogether for we have among us some thoughtful people whose upbringing be coarser but though they can be call fine gentlemen they have make fine contributions to our cause have observe the behaviour of apprentice watermen porter and the gather of rabble in the streets they have arrive at profound knowledge of human nature and make great discoveries about the source spring and motives of moral action the phrase moral action standardly mean action that do or could involve consciously hold reason or purpose these discoveries have demolish the accept systems of morality and do world of good in the city we have men of all sort and professions plod citizens thrive stock broker skillful men of business elegant courtiers gallant men of the army but our chief strength come from those promise young men who have the advantage of modern education these be the grow hop of our sect through their influence we expect the great things we have in view will be actually accomplish would never have think your sect be so considerable many honest folk in england be as much in the dark about these matter as you be it would be wrong to infer what the prevail opinion among people of fashion be from what be say by legislator in parliament judge on the bench or priest in the pulpit they all speak accord to law accord to the reverend prejudice of our forefathers you should go into good company and take note of what able and well breed men say those who be most listen to and most admire in public gather as well as in private conversations only someone who have these opportunities can know our real strength our number and the impression we make on the world by your account there must be many minute philosophers among the men of rank and fortune good many and they contribute greatly to the spread of our notions anyone who know the world have to know that fashion always come from above so the right way to propagate an opinion be to start at the upper end of society also the patronage of men of rank and fortune be an encouragement to our author so you have author among you we do indeed number of them and they be very great men who have favour the world with many useful and profound discoveries he be now lay on really thick his sarcastically intend rhetoric in favour of the minute philosophers he will soon drop it altogether the proper name in this speech refer to real people the device of give one target ancient sound name be common practice in polemical write at that time moschon for instance have prove that man and beast be really of the same nature and that consequently man need only to indulge his sense and appetites to be as happy as brute gorgias have go further demonstrate that man be piece of clock work machine and that think or reason be the same thing as the collision of ball cimon have make distinguish use of these discoveries prove as clearly as any proposition in mathematics that conscience be whim and morality prejudice and that man be no more accountable for his action than clock be for strike what tryphon have write about the usefulness of vice can be refute thrasenor have destroy the foolish prejudice men have against atheism show that republic of atheists might live very happily together demylus have make joke of loyalty and convince the world that there nothing in it we owe to him and to another philosopher of the same type the discovery that public spirit be pointless fanaticism that seize only on weak mind could go on indefinitely recite the discoveries make by writers of this sect but the masterpiece and coup de grace for the old system be learn work by our great diagoras contain demonstration of the nonexistence of god it hasn yet be publish because the public be think to be not yet ripe for it but assure by some judicious friends who have see it that it as clear as daylight and will do world of good by demolish at one blow the whole system of religion these discoveries be publish by our philosophers sometimes in bind book but often merely in pamphlets and loose page make it easier for them to be spread through the kingdom they deserve the credit for the absolute and independent freedom that be grow so fast and frighten the bigots even dull and ignorant people start to open their eye and to be influence by the example and authority of so many able men it should seem by this account or rather by what crito last say that your sect extend their discoveries beyond religion and that the minute philosopher regard loyalty to his king and reverence for the laws as low down things very low down we be too wise to think there be anything sacred about the king or the constitution or indeed about anything else man of sense may seem to show an occasional deference to his king but that as hollow as his deference to god when he kneel at the sacrament so as to qualify himself for an office government job fear god and honour the king be two slavish maxims that have for long time cramp human nature and awe not only weak mind but even men of good understand until their eye be open by our philosophers it easy to see that when the fear of god be quite extinguish the mind must take relax attitude to other duties as soon as those other duties lose their hold on the conscience which always presuppose the existence of god they become mere outward pretences and formalities but still think that englishmen of all school of think however much they may differ on many detail agree in the belief in god and accept at least the proposition of so call natural religion have already tell you my own opinion on those matter and what know to be the opinion of many others think know what have lead you astray euphranor the minute philosophers be sometimes call deists see note on page which have lead you to imagine that they believe in and worship god accord to the light of nature but if you live among them you ll soon be convince of the contrary they have neither time nor place nor form of divine worship they don offer prayers or praise to god in public and in their private live they show disregard or dislike even of the duties of natural religion for example say grace before and after meals this be plain point of natural worship and there be time when everyone do it but in proportion as this sect of minute philosophers prevail it have be lay aside not only by the minute philosophers themselves but also by others who be afraid of be think fool by the minute philosophers be you really say that men who genuinely believe in god decline to perform such an easy and reasonable duty for fear of be sneer at by atheists yes be many people who believe in their hearts the truth of religion be afraid or ashamed to admit it lest they should lose their stand in the eye of those who have the good luck to be regard as great wits and men of genius we must make allowance for crito prejudice euphranor he be worthy gentleman and mean well but doesn it look like prejudice to ascribe the respect that be pay our ingenious free thinkers to good luck rather than to merit sure their merit be very wonderful it would take great man to prove such paradoxes that someone as knowledgeable as minute philosopher should be mere machine or at best no better than brute it be true maxim that man should think with the learn and speak with the vulgar berkeley have already famously say this in his principles of human knowledge regard the vulgar see note on page would be very reluctant to describe gentleman of merit as machine to an audience of prejudice and ignorant men the doctrines of our philosophy have something in common with many other truths in metaphysics geometry astronomy and natural science namely that vulgar ears can bear them all our discoveries and ideas be in themselves true and certain but they be at present know only to the better people and would sound strange and odd among the vulgar it to be hop that this will eventually wear off not surprise that vulgar mind should be startle by the ideas of your philosophy truly very curious sort of philosophy and much to be wonder at the deep thinkers in the minute philosophy camp have go in exactly the opposite way to all the great philosophers of earlier age who try to raise and refine humanity remove it as far as possible from the brute to moderate and subdue men appetites to remind men of the dignity of their nature to awaken and improve their higher faculties and direct them onto the noblest object to fill men mind with high sense of god of the supreme good and of the immortality of the soul but our minute philosophers seem to go the opposite way from all other wise and thoughtful men because they aim to erase from the mind of man the source of all that be great and good to disrupt the order of civil life to undermine the foundations of morality and to bring us down to the maxims and way of think of the most uneducated and barbarous nations and even to pull humanity down to the level of brute beasts and through all this they want to be accept by the world as men of deep knowledge but all this negative knowledge do it come down to anything better than downright savage ignorance that there be no god no spirit no after life no moral duty truly fine system for an honest man to accept or for clever man to be proud of alciphron who hear this discourse with some uneasiness very gravely reply dispute be not to be decide by the weight of authority he say but by the force of reason call our notions brutish and barbarous if you please but it kind of brutishness and barbarism that few people would be capable of if men of the greatest genius hadn clear the log jam because there nothing harder than to overcome one upbringing and conquer old prejudice it take great courage and great strength of faculties to pick out and cast off heap of rubbish that have be gather in the soul from our very infancy so our philosophers thoroughly deserve to be call esprits fort men of strong head free thinkers and so on label that indicate great strength and freedom of mind the heroic labour of these men may be represent for anything can be misrepresent as piratically plunder and strip the mind of its wealth and ornament when really they be only divest it of its prejudice and reduce it to its untainted original state of nature beautiful pure nature you seem to be impress by the beauty of nature please alciphron tell me what the things be that you regard as natural how be we to recognize something as natural for thing to be natural to the mind of man to start with that special case it must appear in the human mind originally from the outset from birth be present universally in the mind of all men and be invariably the same in all nations and age these three originalness universality invariability exclude all the notions that humans have as result of custom and upbringing this also hold for all other species of be cat inclination to pursue mouse be natural because it satisfy the above three criteria but if cat be teach to play trick you win say that the trick be natural for the same reason if peach and apricots be graft onto plum tree nobody will say they be the natural growth of that tree let get back to the human case it seem that the only things you ll count as natural in mankind be ones that show themselves at the time of person first entrance into the world namely the sense and such passions and appetites as reveal themselves as soon as their respective object appear hunger when there be milk fear when there be loud noise and so on that be my opinion note euphranor now ask alciphron seven rhetorical question to the first six of which alciphron give the expect answer include it seem so do and it be true to spare us the tedious questionand answer routine the question will appear here as simple statements with the first six answer omit this condense device will be use on fourteen other occasion each mark by four or more statements by euphranor label with roman numerals and mention of this note the leave blossom and apples of an apple tree be natural to it although it doesn have them from the outset ii the appetite of lust and the faculty of reason be natural to man even though they don shoot forth open and display themselves as leave and blossom do in tree until long after his original infancy iii so it seem that you be be rash when you say that the first criterion for something be natural to the mind be that it should appear in it originally iv also it be natural for an orange tree to produce oranges but if you plant such tree at the north end of great britain you may if you work hard at it get good salad leave but no fruit in the southern part of the island hard careful work may get it to produce mediocre fruit but in portugal or naples it will produce much better fruit with little or no trouble on the part of the farmer vi the plant be the same in all these place but it doesn produce the same fruit sun soil and cultivation make difference vii and since accord to you it the same story for every species can we conclude that some things may be natural to mankind although they be not find in all men and aren invariably the same where they be find hold on euphranor you must explain yourself further shan be rush into concede your point you re right to be wary alciphron don like these ensnare question don want you to go along with me out of politeness just tell me what you think about each particular matter so that we understand one another know what we agree on and proceed together in find out the truth our opinions will stand the test we fear no trial proceed as you please see note on page we seem to have find that things may be natural to men without actually be on display in all men or not as completely on display because differences of culture and other advantage affect what come of human nature as much as they do with the nature of plant be use your own comparison ii men at all time and place when they arrive at certain age express their thoughts by speech iii so it seem that language be natural iv yet there be great variety of languages from all this it follow that thing may be natural and yet admit of variety vi it seem to follow that thing may be natural to mankind without have the mark of naturalness that you present without be original universal and invariable vii consequently religious worship and civil government may be natural to man despite the fact that they occur in variety of form and in different degrees of perfection viii you have grant already that reason be natural to mankind ix so whatever be agreeable to reason be agreeable to the nature of man doesn it follow from this that truth and virtue be natural to man whatever be reasonable admit to be natural the fruit that we value most be the ones that come from the most strongly grow and mature stock in the choicest soil similarly then oughtn we to value most the sublime truths that be the fruit of mature think and have be rationally deduce by men with the best and most develop mind and if this be right and these things be in fact reasonable natural and true they oughtn to be write off as unnatural whims errors of upbringing and groundless prejudice just because they be raise and develop by manure and cultivate young human mind because they take root early and bring forth early fruit through the care and diligence of our instructors agree provide that they can still be rationally deduce but to take for grant that what men vulgarly call the truths of morality and religion have rational basis would be beg the question he mean that it would be in effect include the conclusion of one argument amongst its premise that be the only mean of beg the question until late in the th century when the vulgar specifically the ones work as journalists learn the phrase and assume that it mean raise the question you re right about that so don take for grant that the truths of morality and religion be rationally deduce only suppose that if they be then they must be regard as natural to man that they fit with and grow from the most excellent part of human nature the part that other natural species don have have no objection to bring against this then what be we to think of your former assertions mean your claim that anything that be natural to man can be find in all men in all nations and age of the world and that to obtain genuine view of human nature we must set aside all the effect of upbringing and instruction and look only at the sense appetites and passions that be to be find originally in all mankind and that therefore the notion of god can be base in nature because it isn originally in the mind and isn the same in all men how do you reconcile these open statements of yours with your recent concessions ones that the force of truth seem to have extort from you tell me euphranor isn truth single uniform invariable thing and if it be isn the existence of the many different and mutually inconsistent notions that men have of god and duty plain proof there be no truth in them freely grant that truth be constant and uniform so that two opinions that contradict one another can both be true but it doesn follow that they be both false when there be conflict opinions about the same thing the one if there be one that be ground on clear and evident reason should be regard as true and others accept only to the extent that they be consistent with that privilege one reason be the same at all time and place and when it be use properly it will lead to the same conclusions two thousand years ago socrates seem to have reason himself into the same notion of god that be entertain by the philosophers of our days if you ll allow someone who isn free thinker to be call philosopher and consider confucius remark that man should be on guard in his youth against lust in manhood against quarrelsomeness and in old age against greed this morality be as current in europe as in china but when opinions differ that show that there be uncertainty so it would be good if all men think the same way what do you think to be the cause of lunar eclipse the earth come between the sun and moon make shadow on the moon be you sure of this certainly be all mankind agree in this truth by no mean ignorant and barbarous people give different ridiculous explanations for this phenomenon so it seem that there be different opinions about the nature of an eclipse there be yet one of these opinions be true it be thus when there be conflict opinions about something it may still be the case that the thing exist and one of the opinions about it be true accept that well you argue from the variety of opinions about god nature to the falsity of the opinion that he exist and now it seem that this argument be not conclusive and don see either how you can infer the falsity of any moral or religious tenet from men conflict opinions on the same subject isn argue like that on par with argue that no historical account of matter of fact can be true if report of it conflict with one another or argue that because the various school of philosophy maintain different opinions none of them can be in the right not even the minute philosophers during this conversation lysicles seem uneasy like someone who profoundly want there to be no god alciphron he say think you be sit tamely on the side line while euphranor undermine the foundation of our tenets don be afraid reply skillful player of game sometimes ruin his adversary by give him some advantage at first be glad he say turn to euphranor that you re will to argue and make your appeal to reason for my part shan be afraid to follow wherever reason lead so let me say this openly freely concede the point you have be contend for don value the success of few crude notions throw out in casual conversation any more than the turks care about the loss of the rubbish infantry that they position at the front of their armies so as to waste the gunpowder and blunt the swords of their enemies have keep good half of my arguments in reserve and be ready to bring them forward will undertake to prove don doubt your ability to prove alciphron but before put you to the trouble of any more proof like to know whether the notions of your minute philosophy be worth prove mean whether they be useful and helpful to mankind as to that let me tell you thing can be useful to one man view and not to another but truth be truth whether or not it useful and it mustn be evaluate by whether it be convenient for this or that man or sect but isn the general good of mankind to be regard as rule or guide to evaluation of moral truths indeed of all truths that direct or influence the moral action see note on page of men it not clear to me that that be right know of course that legislators theologians and politicians have always maintain that it be necessary for the well be of mankind that men should be keep in awe by the slavish notions of religion and morality but even if you be right about what be convenient or helpful how do that prove these moral notions to be true convenience be one thing and truth be another so real philosopher will set aside all advantage and consider only truth itself tell me alciphron be your real philosopher wise man or fool without question he the wisest of men as between someone who act with design and someone who act at random which should we regard as the wiser the one who act with design see note on page well then whoever act with design act for some end ii and wise man act for good end iii and he show his wisdom in his choice of mean to the end he aim at iv and so the more excellent the pursue end be and the more appropriate the choose mean to it be the wiser the person should be think to be now rational agent can aim at more excellent end than happiness vi of good things the greater good be most excellent vii the general happiness of mankind be greater good than the private happiness of one man or of some particular class of men viii so the general happiness of mankind be the most excellent end ix so those who pursue this end by the most appropriate methods should be regard as the wisest men wise man be govern by wise notions rather than foolish ones xi it seem to follow that someone who promote the general well be of mankind by the proper necessary mean be truly wise and act on wise ground xii furthermore folly be the opposite of wisdom xii so mightn we infer that men who try to dislodge principles that have necessary connection with the general good of mankind be foolish perhaps this might be grant but at the same time have to say that it be in my power to deny it what you admit the premise so surely you win deny the conclusion want to know what the rule be for our debate in this process of question and answer if man make slip be he allow to recover for if you be on the lookout for every advantage that you can snatch without allow for surprise or inattention on my part have to tell you that this be not the way to convince me of your view not aim at triumph alciphron all want be truth so it completely open to you to unravel all that have be say and to correct any slip you have make but then you must point it out clearly otherwise we can ever arrive at any conclusion be also sincerely devote to truth and agree with you on these term to proceed together in search of it in the course of our present inquiry think slip when acknowledge that the general happiness of mankind be greater good than the particular happiness of one man in fact the individual happiness of each man alone constitute his own entire good the happiness of other men be not part of my happiness so from my standpoint it isn good mean true natural good so it can be reasonable end for me to aim at because no wise man will pursue an end that doesn concern him be talk about true natural end not the end one might announce as political pretences this be the voice of nature the fountain source and pattern of all that be good and wise so would you like to follow nature and accept her as guide and as pattern for you to imitate want that more than anything where do you get this respect for nature from from the excellence of its productions for example you say that there be usefulness and excellence in plant because its many part be connect and fit to each other in such way as to protect and nourish the whole plant make the individual grow and propagate the species and also because we get pleasure and benefit from it grapes from vine shade or timber from an oak just so similarly don you infer the excellence of animal body from observe the structure and fitness of their many part which enable the part to work together for the well be of each other as well as of the whole animal don you also notice natural union and co operation between animals of the same species and that even animals of different species have certain qualities and instincts through which they contribute to the exercise nourishment and delight of each other even inanimate inorganic materials seem to have an excellence relative to each other why would water be excellent if it didn cause herbs and vegetables to spring from the earth and put forth flower and fruit and what would become of the beauty of the earth if it weren warm by the sun moisten by water and fan by air note the four elements of ancient greek philosophy throughout the whole system of the visible and natural world don you see mutual connection and correspondence of part and isn that the basis for your idea of the perfection and order and beauty of nature accept all this now didn the stoics who be no more bigots than you be say and didn you say few minutes ago that this pattern of natural order be one that rational agents ought to imitate don deny that this be true so oughtn we infer the same union order and regularity in the moral world that we see in the natural world we ought shouldn it seem to follow from this that reasonable creatures be make for one another and consequently that man who want live accord to nature ought to consider himself not as an independent individual whose happiness be unconnected with the happiness of others but rather as the part of whole for whose common good he ought work together with the other part other men suppose this to be true what then win it follow that wise man should consider and pursue his own private good in the light of and in combination the good of other men you grant this point but later say that that be slip indeed the point doesn need fancy argument by me because it have always be see to be clearly prove by how we feel for one another pain and pleasure and by the mutual affections by which mankind be knit together and because it be the constant doctrine of those who be think the wisest and most thoughtful men among the ancients platonists aristotelians and stoics not to mention christians whom you pronounce to be an unthinking prejudice sort of people shan dispute this point with you well then since we be in agreement up to here shouldn it seem to follow from the premise that if the beliefs in god future state and moral duties be necessarily connect with the well be of mankind then those beliefs be the only wise right and genuine source of human conduct you have be lead to this conclusion by your own concessions and by the analogy of nature by the thesis that human conduct ought to fall into pattern that natural events do fall into have be draw into it step by step through many preliminaries and can now remember them all clearly but would point out that you rely on the thesis that those religious and moral principles be necessarily connect with the well be of mankind and that something that you haven prove and haven grant berkeley text like this version of it leave unclear what direction of necessary connection in question either the beliefs in god etc inevitably contribute to human well be or without them human well be be impossible think it great big fundamental prejudice and if have time could show you that that what it be but it late now shall we put off this subject till tomorrow with that we put an end to our conversation for that even second dialogue tuesday in the original work though not in this version this dialogue be the second to longest of the set it not very interest philosophically and connect fact in it the free think side be uphold only by lysicles with alciphron silent throughout next morning alciphron and lysicles say that the weather be so fine that they would like to spend the day outside have picnic meal under shade in some pleasant part of the countryside so we go to nearby beach and walk on the sand until the sun become too hot to be comfortable we then go in among the tree and sit down and immediately lysicles address himself to now ready to make good on my undertake to show there be nothing in the necessary connection that some men imagine there to be between the principles you be defend and the public good if the question be to be decide by the authority of legislators or philosophers of course it would go against us that because those men generally take it for grant that vice be harmful to the public and that the only way to keep men from vice be through their fear of god and their sense of an after life from which they infer that the belief in such things be necessary to the well be of mankind this false notion have hold sway for centuries and have do an infinite amount of mischief it have be the real cause of religions be establish within state and of the way laws and magistrates have protect and encourage the clergy and their superstitions even some of the wisest ancient philosophers ones who agree with our sect in deny the existence of god and the immortality of the soul be weak enough to accept the common prejudice that vice be hurtful to human societies but england have recently produce great philosophers who have undeceive the world and conclusively show that private vices be public benefit this be the subtitle of mandeville notorious fable of the be lysicles will now devote about page to present arguments take from mandeville it wasn until now that this discovery be make and our sect of free thinkers have the glory of it back to sarcasm it may be that some men with fine intellects do in former age have glimpse of this important truth but probably they live at ignorant time and in bigoted countries that weren ripe for such discovery men of few talents and short sight be able to see no further than one link along chain of consequences be shock at small evils that come with vice but those who can take in more and look along lengthy series of events can see thousands of examples of happiness result from vice and of good grow out of evil shan trouble you with authoritative writers or elaborate arguments let just look at some plain matter of fact take each particular vice and track it through all its effect and consequences and you clearly see the advantage it bring to the public drunkenness for instance be harmful vice accord to your sober moralists but that because they didn take into account the good effect that flow from it lysicles go on to describe some of these for vulgar drunkenness income from tax on malt and employment for many different kinds of workers in the beer industry for drunkenness cause by wine and spirit admittedly that send money into foreign countries but it create employment in the home country vastly increase and proliferate by the need for ship then there be all the trade involve in make things that ship export to pay for the wine and spirit and every trade be support by and support yet further trade so that there no end to the good that come from drunkenness then equally stupidly your half witted folk be give to condemn game here play card for money on the face of it card play seem to be very idle and useless occupation but if you dig down below the face of it you ll see that this idle pastime employ the card maker who provide work for the paper mill which support the poor man who collect discard rag not to mention the workers who be employ in build and equip those mill look still deeper and you ll find that candle to light the game and the hire of sedan chair to take the players to the game employ the industrious and the poor in this way they be help by card sharpers and gentlemen who wouldn give penny in charity you may object that many gentlemen and ladies be ruin by game but if you do you aren take into account that what one man lose another get so that as many be enrich as be ruin money change hand that what the life of business and commerce consist in the circulation of money when money be spend the public doesn care who spend it suppose an upper class fool be cheat by very low breed fellow who have more brain what harm do this do to the public poverty be relieve ingenuity be reward the money stay at home you may object that man make poor by game may resort to some desperate conduct that will be hurtful to the public lysicles go on to speak of the good highwayman can do mainly by spend extravagantly during his short and merry life but also through the reward that may go to poor family that turn him in to the police my topic be game which smoothly lead me to the advantage of highway robbery oh the beautiful and neverenough admire connection of vices it would take too long to show how they all hang together and what an infinite amount of good arise from each of them ll add just few word now on favourite vice then ll leave you to work out the rest of the story for yourself ve show you how consider poor girl who doesn have what you would call an honest half crown week to spend she have the good luck to become someone keep mistress and immediately she employ milliners laundresses dressers fabric sellers and number of other trade all to the benefit of her country we could go on for ever track every particular vice through its consequences and effect show the vast advantage they all bring to the public the true spring that drive the great machine of commerce and make the state flourish have be little understand until now your moralists and theologians have long be corrupt the genuine sense of mankind fill men head with absurd principles so long and so absurd that few men now can look at life with an unprejudiced eye and fewer still have the talents and intelligence to pursue long chain of consequences relations and dependences which be what you must do if you want to form sound and complete notion of the public welfare oh say euphranor who have listen to this speech very attentively you be the very man want lysicles eloquent and able well inform about the principles of your sect and will to impart them to others tell me be it easy to get these principles accept in the world it be easy among very able men and people of fashion though you ll sometimes meet with strong prejudice against them in people of the middle sort an effect of ordinary talents and low breed be surprise if men be not shock at such surprise notions so contrary to all laws education and religion they have be even more shock if it hadn be for the skillful write style of our philosophers know that most men be influence by name rather than by things they have introduce certain clean up way of speak which lessen much of the revulsion and prejudice against vice explain this for me well in our dialect an immoral man be man of pleasure card sharper be one who play the whole game an adulterous lady be say to have an affair an adulterous gentleman be say to be gallant rogue in business be say to be one who know the world by this mean we have no such things as drunkards womanisers whore or rogues in the fashionable world whose inhabitants can enjoy their vices without have nasty label attach to them so it seem that vice be fine thing with an ugly name be assure it be plato be afraid that young people might be corrupt by the myths that represent the gods as vicious accord to you it seem that attitude be an effect of his weakness and ignorance it be take my word for it yet plato have keep good company and live in court and cicero who know the world well have deep respect for him plato and cicero may have look good in ancient athens or rome but if they return to life today they would be regard as underbred pedants at most coffee house in london there be several able men who could convince plato and cicero that they know nothing about morals and politics the very topics that they be value so much for not the most sharp witted of men lysicles hasn pick up the note of sarcastic scorn in what crito have just say know ever so many shrewd men both in royal court circle and in the business part of the city who have five time plato sense and don care in the slightest what notion their sons have of god or virtue can illustrate this doctrine of lysicles by two examples that will make you perceive its force the examples be fictional in the first minute philosopher turn his son into member of that sect which lead to the son murder him and then squander his estate until he go bankrupt in the second minute philosopher convert his wife to his way of think he rightly think this will stop her from give to charity and this lead her to adopt an extravagant way of life include play card for high stake thus use up most of her husband wealth in each case crito recite the mandevillean public benefit of the behaviour in question the murderous son recklessness spread his inherit wealth more widely than his miserly father ever would have do the extravagant wife through her game transfer considerable share of her husband fortune to number of sharp witted men who need it more and circulate it faster than her husband would have do crito maintain straight face while he tell these stories but couldn help smile which lysicles notice superficial mind he say may find something to ridicule in these account but anyone who be really competent in rational think must see that wise commonwealth ought to encourage maxims that bring benefit to everyone and do harm only to particular private persons or families speak for myself say euphranor declare that dazzle and bewilder rather than convince by your reason as you yourself point out it take great deal of think to grasp the connections of many distant point so please put up with my slowness and allow me to take to piece something that be too big to be take in all at once and when can match your speed allow me to follow you step by step as fast as can that be reasonable it not everyone who can all in one swoop take in long chain of argument see note on page your various arguments seem to centre on this vice circulate money and promote industry which cause people to flourish ii and vice produce this effect by cause extravagant consumption which be the most beneficial to the manufacturers give them quick demand and high price iii so you think that drunkard because he drink more than other men bring more benefit to the brewer and the vintner than other men do iv healthy man drink more than sick man sober man be healthier than drunkard so vi sober man in good health may drink more than drunkard when he be sick vii man will consume more meat and drink in long life than in short one viii so sober healthy man may in long life circulate more money by eat and drink than glutton or drunkard circulate in short life what of it well it seem that the sober healthy man may be more beneficial to the public mean beneficial through how he eat and drink than the glutton or the drunkard be you ll never get me to agree that temperance be the way to promote drink but you will agree that sickness lessen drink and that death put an end to it the same argument will hold so far as can see for every vice that harm men health and shorten their live and if that be so the public benefit of vice win be so sure grant some makers or traders might be as well encourage by the sober men as the vicious what about the ones whose livelihood depend entirely on vice and vanity if there be people like that couldn they be employ in some other way without loss to the public tell me lysicles be there anything in the nature of vice in itself that make it public bless or be it only the consumption it cause have already show how it benefit the nation by the consumption of things the nation manufacture and you have agree that long and healthy life consume more than short and sickly one and you win deny that many consume more than one you do the math which be more likely to promote the industry of his countrymen virtuous marry man with healthy children of his own who also feed and clothe the orphan in his neighbourhood or fashionable loose live man about town doesn innocently spend money circulate as well as money spend on vice and if it do so doesn your line of think imply that innocent activities benefit the public as much as vicious ones what have prove prove clearly and nothing more need to be say about it can see that you have prove anything unless you can show that it be impossible to spend fortune innocently have think that the public welfare of nation consist in the number and good condition of its inhabitants have you anything to object to this think not which would contribute more to this end employ men in outdoor manly exercise or employ them in sedentary business within doors the former suppose doesn it seem to follow that build garden and agriculture would employ men more usefully to the public than if tailor barber perfumers distillers and the like be multiply agree but this go against you because what incite men to build and plant be vanity and vanity be vice but if man be to build and plant mean to employ people to build and plant for his convenience or pleasure in proportion to his fortune without foolish ostentation and without exaggerate the value of his house and garden they wouldn be the effect of vice and how do you know that this can happen the economic argument about whether and to what extent private vices be public benefit continue through many not very interest page with lysicles continue to be stubborn and continue not to understand the spirit in which crito extravagantly support the minute philosophers position talk of all the good that have be do by the fire in london and the injustice do to free thinker who in purely principled way murder his father and be hang for it they discuss little the question of whether it be dangerous to publish such view the answer be that it be safe on the anti religious side of the minute philosophy doctrine less so on the pro vice legal and political side lysicles say that he want the whole governmental and legal structure overhaul in the light of the pro vice principles that free thinkers have discover then you be it seem in favour of bring about thorough reformation as for what be commonly call the reformation could never see how the world be the better for it protestantism be much the same as popery except for be more prudish and disagreeable note writer of ours calculate that the benefit of hoop petticoats be nearly equal to the benefit of the reformation but think he be flatter it come back to your question thorough reformation be thorough liberty leave nature absolutely free to work her own way and all will be well that what we aim at our principles win let us settle for less crito be zealous protestant and when he hear lysicles pass jab at the reformation he couldn refrain from join in speak his own mind rather than parody the free thinkers the worst effect of the reformation he say be that it rescue wicked men from darkness that have keep them in awe this have turn out to be hold out light to robbers and murderers and the light bring by the reformation may have do harm in another way too namely by encourage free think it didn have to do that light in itself be good and the light that show man the folly of popish superstition might also show him the truth of protestant religion and the madness of atheism but some people have use the light only to see the evils on one side roman catholicism and to run blindly into the arm of the worse evils of the opposite extreme atheism that be to make the best of things produce evil in the way that you show the worst things produce good namely accidentally or indirectly lysicles be little disconcert by crito emphatic tone but after short pause he reply briskly that not everyone have the talent to think about the public good true say euphranor also think that not everyone can frame notion of the public good much less make good judgments about how to promote it but you lysicles who be master of this subject please tell me doesn the public good of nation imply the particular good of its individuals it do and doesn the good or happiness of man consist in his have both soul and body sound and in good condition enjoy the things that their natures require and free from things that be odious or hurtful to them don deny that all this be true well it seem worthwhile to consider whether the regular decent life of virtuous man mightn be as conducive to this as the mad sallies of intemperance and debauchery ll admit that without the aid of vice nation may merely survive be keep alive but it can possibly flourish to get money and goods into rapid circulation in state there must be extravagant and irregular motion in the appetites and passions the more people nation contain and the happier they be the more that nation can be say to flourish think we be agree on this we be so you concede that riches be not an ultimate end but should be consider only as mean to happiness do it seem that mean can be useful unless we know what the end be and how to apply the mean to it it seem so doesn it follow that in order to make nation flourish it isn enough to make it wealthy without know what the true end and happiness of mankind be and how to apply wealth towards achieve that end to the extent that these point be know and practise think the nation would be likely to flourish but for people who don know or practise them gain riches seem to me on par with let sick man have plenty of food and drink which it will harm him to consume this be just sophistry it be argue without persuade look into how in general people live their live examine the pursuits of men have due respect for the people ways of interact and get on with one another and you ll soon be convince that nation can be make flourish and happy through riches just through riches give them wealth and they will make themselves happy without that political invention that trick of governments and philosophers call virtue in the next few page which be not philosophically very nourish the main topics of discussion be these whether virtue be trick of governments which segment of the population should be listen to with respect lysicles respond to euphranor suggestion of country gentlemen and farmers and the better sort of tradesmen with blunder rudeness if people in general be so open to prejudice mightn there be some prejudice in the minute philosophers position bodily health be real objective state which can be drive up or down by what be do to the body why not an analogous view of spiritual or mental health here be how this last theme develop can we suppose that there be such state as healthy constitution of the soul the state it be in when its notions be right its judgments true its will regular its passions and appetites keep moderate and direct to the right object and the man whose mind be so constitute isn he properly call virtuous and shouldn every good man try to produce this healthy disposition in the mind of his countrymen if these things have any appearance of truth as they seem to me to have it isn so obvious that virtue be mere whim or fashion or trick as you choose to say it be you take me by surprise when you say this must admit give the conversation we have about this yesterday even if you call that back to your mind it might perhaps save both of us some trouble frankly euphranor admit to have forget everything you say about virtue duty and all that the point you make be of an airy notional nature which make them apt to vanish without leave any trace in mind that be accustom to receive impression only from realities at this euphranor look at crito and me and say smile have be get out of line my role be to learn and his to instruct then we have several page about happiness and especially pleasure human pleasures versus animal ones higher pleasures versus lower ones transient pleasures versus more last ones and so on euphranor allude to the sincerity the intensity and the duration of pleasures at one point lysicles rhapsodize about the pleasures of card play people of fashion couldn live without card they provide the most delightful way of pass an even for an assemblage of gentlemen and ladies who otherwise wouldn know what to say or do with themselves and pack of card doesn merely give them something to do when they be together it also draw them together square dance give them pleasure to look forward to during the dull hours of the day they reflect on it with delight and it be something to talk about when it be over so the chief amusement of these people of fashion be an activity that any manual labourer can engage in be as well qualify to get pleasure from card as peer be it look as though life be drag for these people of fashion and that their fortunes aren do them much good can well imagine that when people of certain sort be bring together they would prefer do anything to the boredom of their own conversation but it isn easy to think that there any great pleasure in this play here play card for money be serious amusement that bring relief to man of pleasure after the more lively and affect enjoyments of sense it kill time better than anything and be most admirable antidote to redirect or prevent thoughts that might otherwise prey on the mind can easily see that no man on earth ought to value antidotes for irritable boredom more than man of fashion and pleasure an ancient sage speak of someone of that sort say he be make wretched by disappointments and appetites and if this be true of the greeks who live in the sun and have so much spirit incline to think it even truer of our modern englishmen there something in our climate and our make up that make it especially true of us that idleness its own punishment an uneducated fine gentleman pay for his momentary pleasures with long and cruel intervals of be bore and out of sort to relieve these he be drive into sensual excesses which further depress his spirit his low condition while create greater need for pleasures lessen his ability to enjoy them an englishman cast of mind make him the most unsuccessful rake in the world rake term that we ll meet several time more be man whose way of life be stylish and fashionable but also promiscuous and dissolute he be in aristotle phrase at odds with himself he isn brute enough to enjoy his appetites or man enough to govern them he know and feel that what he pursue be not his true good and when he look inwards all he find be the misery that his habitual sluggishness and idleness win allow him to remedy eventually have grow odious to himself and hat his own company he join any idle group that he can not in the hope of pleasure but merely to relieve the pain of his own mind listless and uneasy in the present he have no delight in reflect on what be past or in the prospect of anything to come when after wretched lifetime of vanity and woe his animal nature be wear to the stump this man of pleasure alternate between want death and dread it he be sick of live without ever have try or know the true life of man ironically it just as well that this sort of life which be of so little benefit to its owner bring so much benefit to the public then some discussion of courage and of why there aren more disillusion minute philosophers who commit suicide crito answer because they aren sure they be right about god and the after life then socrates who be no country parson suspect that your men of pleasure be such be men of pleasure through ignorance ignorance of what of the art of compute calculate as it be mathematically he think that rake can do their sum and that because of this lack in their intellects they make wrong judgments about pleasure where their happiness depend on their make right ones don understand you do you agree that the sense perceive only sensible things do and the sense perceive only things that be present accept that too so pleasures of the understand and future pleasures aren to be judge by the sense they be not so people who judge pleasures by the sense may find themselves mistake at the bottom line he quote some line from the latin satirical poet persius about someone end up with his joint ruin by gout so that his limbs be like brittle beech tree branch lament the way he have spend his life and depress at the think of the kind of life that lie ahead of him then to get the computation right shouldn you consider all the faculties and all the kinds of pleasure take the future into account as well as the present and rat them all accord to their true value the epicureans hold that pleasure that produce greater pain or that hinder greater pleasure should be regard as pain and that pain that produce greater pleasure or prevent greater pain be to be account pleasure thus if we be to make true estimate of pleasure that great spring of action from which the conduct of life get its direction we have to compute intellectual pleasures and future ones as well as sensible pleasures and present ones and in estimate each particular pleasure we have to take into account all the pain and evils all the disgust remorse and shame that come with it and we ought to take account of the kind as well as the quantity of each pleasure let free thinker merely consider how little human pleasure consist in actual sensation and how much in prospect then let him then compare the prospect of virtuous believer with that of an unbelieving rake euphranor briefly join in and lysicles respond sharply that the free thinkers calculate that what you call good christian must be unfit for the world affairs thus while you compute yourselves out of pleasure others compute you out of business then further conversation about the personal character of minute philosophers and then about how they spread their word the role of writers in this the effect on the young of free think ideas savage anecdotes about this by crito then wouldn there always be rake and rogues even if we didn make them believe me the world always be and always will be the same as long as men be men deny that the world be always the same human nature to use alciphron comparison be like land better or worse depend on how it be manage and what seed or principles be sow in it agree there might be bad men through the force of corrupt appetites and unruly passions even if nobody accept your tenets but when to the force of appetite and passion men add the force of opinion and be wicked on principle there will be more men who be wicked and they will be more incurably and outrageously wicked the error of lively rake lie in his passions and may be reform but the dry rogue who set himself up in judgments be incorrigible more discussion of the character of minute philosophers their place in history and other relate topics then we have maxim namely that each should take care of one should take care of himself alas lysicles you wrong your own character you minute philosophers want to get the world and yourselves to accept you as cunning self interest men but can anything be more disinterested not self interest than to give up all concern with the theoretical pursuit of truth can anything be less cunning than to publish your discoveries to the world teach others to play the whole game and arm mankind against yourselves re play the whole game see lysicles speech well in our dialect on page to you folk who be fire with love of truth and love of liberty and grasp the whole extent of nature suggest that to those love you add love of your country forgive me for introduce such low down think would urge you to be cautious in the same way that all other discoverers projectors and makers of experiment be they never risk everything on the first trial wouldn it be prudent to try the success of your principles on small model in some remote corner of the earth for instance set up colony of atheists in monomotapa in southern africa and see how it prosper before you proceed any further at home half dozen shiploads of minute philosophers could easily be spar for such good plan in the meantime you gentlemen who have discover that there nothing to be hop or fear in an after life that conscience be nag pest that the band of government and the cement of human society be rotten things that can be dissolve and crumble into nothing by the arguments of any minute philosopher be so good as to keep these sublime discoveries to yourselves and allow all the rest of us to continue in the beliefs and ways of think establish by the laws of our country speak seriously do wish you would try your experiment among the hottentots or turks we think well of the hottentots believe them to be an unprejudiced people but afraid their diet and customs wouldn agree with our philosophers as for the turks they be bigots who have notion of god and respect for jesus christ doubt if it would be safe to venture among them then make your experiment in some other christian country we think that all other christian nations be much under the power of prejudice even our neighbour the dutch be too much prejudice in favour of their religion which their law have establish for prudent man to attempt innovations under their government on the whole it seem that no country can offer as much security and prospect of success for our scheme as england do not to mention the fact that we have already make good progress the right way to start this experiment be to wipe out the prejudice of individual persons we have carry on this work for many years work hard and skillfully at first secretly as our principles gain acceptance and as our number grow we gradually reveal ourselves and our opinions and needn tell you where we have now come to we have grub and weed and clear human nature so thoroughly that before long you ll see natural and sound ideas sprout up by themselves without any labour or teach crito report the view of wise man whom he doesn name that the worst and most unwholesome weed be this same minute philosophy from there he move to recount fable about contest in hell to select the devil who could do most harm to humanity the runner up appear as gunpowder produce great noise and destruction and fear the winner set up as pharmacist thus he pass as friend and physician through the world disguise himself with sweets and perfume and drug make his way into pharmacies and ladies cabinets and under pretence of help digestion comfort the spirit and cheer the heart he produce direct contrary effect and quietly and invisibly push great number of mankind into fatal decay decay that be fatal in the sense of be fat inevitable unstoppable he populate hell and the grave so fast that he earn the post of ruler of hell which he still hold those who please may amuse themselves with fables and allegories this be plain english liberty be good thing and we be the support of liberty it seem to me that liberty and virtue be make for each other if someone want to enslave his country the best preparation for that be vice and nothing lead to vice so surely as irreligion do simply can understand and have try how this hostility to religion can be an effect of honest view regard just and legal liberty let us examine what good your principles have do who have be the better for the instructions of these minute philosophers let us compare what we be in respect of learn loyalty honesty wealth power and public spirit with what we have be free think as it be call have grow amazingly in recent years let us see what have grow up along with it or as result of it shan list all the resultant ills that would be nasty task and on the other side there be the only bless that the minute philosophy can claim namely luxury the same bless that open up ancient rome to the world revenge the same luxury that make nation look full and fat when it actually have one foot in the grave you have this wrong our sect think and argue better than anyone about the public good of state and we have invent here discover many things that be conducive to the public good but can yet conveniently be put into practice but the public have receive one advantage from the spread of your principles namely the old roman practice of self murder this put an end to all distress stop miserable people from go on be burden to the world and to themselves you choose to make some remark about this custom little while ago page and to laugh at the irresolution of our free thinkers who couldn make up their mind to kill themselves but can tell you as matter of fact that they have often recommend it by their example as well as by arguments and that it be solely because of them that this practice useful and magnanimous as it be have be take out of the hand of lunatics and restore to the status among men of sense that it have in ancient time in whatever light you may look at it this be in fact solid benefit but the best effect of our principles be the light and truth that they have so visibly spread through the world the number of prejudice errors perplexities and contradictions that we have clear out of the mind of our fellow subject the number of hard word and intricate absurd notions that possess the mind of men before our philosophers appear in the world now even women and children have right and sound notions of things what do you say to this crito say regard these great advantage of destroy men and notions that doubt that the public gain as much by the destruction of notions as it lose by the destruction of men speak for myself have rather my wife and children all have beliefs with no real thoughts behind them and daily pronounce word without mean than that any one of them should cut her throat or leap out of window the public doesn care much about errors and nonsense as such it be less concern with whether notion be metaphysically true than with whether it will tend to produce good or evil truth itself be value by the public because it do have an influence and be felt in the course of life but the minute philosophers be not the men to whom we owe most for discoveries of that kind make this point on the basis that your notions be in fact true and in fact don think they be candidly think they be not only harmful but also false the tendency of your opinions be so bad that no good man can endure them and your arguments for them be so weak that no wise man will accept them hasn it be prove as clear as the midday sun that since the spread of our principles the more smoothly civilise sort of men have lead much happier live and have be swim in pleasure but don want to repeat things that have already prove so ll add just one point our principles bring advantage even to very small children and to women they deliver children from terrors by night and ladies from intensely bore hours by day crito fiercely attack this say that we should compute what liberate lady will give up against what she will get through the minute philosophy and that at the bottom line you shall find that empty giddy gaudy flutter thing not half so happy as butterfly or grasshopper on summer day similarly for the liberate man end with this when his sense and appetite fade and he seek refuge from his conscience in the minute philosophy the real truth about him be that he affect much believe little know nothing lysicles make couple of short interventions in the second of them say that none of this will make our principles less true crito snap back their truth be not what we be talk about our present topic be the usefulness of your principles and to decide this all we need be to get an overview of them fairly state and lay side by side there be no god or providence man be as the beasts that perish man happiness like that of the beasts consist in obey animal instincts appetites and passions all sting of conscience and sense of guilt be prejudice and errors of upbringing religion be state trick vice be beneficial to the public the soul of man be corporeal and dissolve like flame or vapour man be machine drive accord to the laws of motion so he do not act and can be guilty of anything wise man evaluate and choose all his action in this life on the basis of his own individual self interest it seem that these opinions and others like them be the tenets of minute philosopher who be himself accord to his own principles an organ play on by perceptible object ball swat about by appetites and passions he be so acute mind that he can maintain all this by skillful reason so sharp sight and penetrate and deep that he can discover that the only true wisdom be the most self interest secret cunning to round out this character sketch this ingenious piece of clockwork have no source of action within itself and deny that it have or can have single free think or motion set itself up as the protector of liberty and argue earnestly for free think the moment crito stop speak lysicles address himself to euphranor and me crito he say have take vast amount of trouble but have convince me of only one solitary thing namely that haven hope of convince him never in my whole life have meet with man so deeply immerse in prejudice leave it others to pull him out of the mire but have better hop of convince you speak for myself say can answer that my eye and ears be always open to conviction attend to everything that be say and my over all final judgment whether right or wrong will at least be quite impartial crito be bolder than be undertake in this way to scold and lecture philosopher for my part always find it easier to learn than to teach so ll ask for your help in rid me of some worry about the practical effect of your opinions topic that haven be able to get on top of though ever so will when this be do perhaps we still win tread in exactly the same step perhaps we win even walk on the same road but we shan keep come into direct collision with one another he then present set of feeble examples in support of the general thesis that extremes lead to opposite extremes in the natural world and also he add in the civil world where power produce licence and licence produce power bigots make atheists and atheists make bigots the threat be that if the success of the minute philosophy lead to lax government and great licentiousness there will be reaction take the country to the opposite extreme of something like what we might call fascism euphranor then launch into another worry that have about the tendency of your opinions it be than an england cleanse of protestant christianity would create spiritual vacuum not his phrase that would be fill by many subtle and effective covert missionaries for roman catholicism lysicles reply that the minute philosophers don prefer any religion to any other and that if roman catholicism become the enforce orthodoxy of england they would all go along with it and what about their minute philosophy oh we should have more than ever of that for we should keep it all to ourselves crito remark that the minute philosophers tend to make friends of the jesuits ignorantly unaware that the jesuits be subtle and sophisticate enough to make dupe of the minute philosophers then here crito pause and fix his eye on alciphron who during this whole conversation have sit thoughtful and attentive without say word sometimes seem dissatisfy at what lysicles advance at other time apparently serene and please as though approve some better think of his own but the day be now far advance and alciphron propose to adjourn the argument till the follow day then he say shall put matter on new foundation and in light that be so full and clear that be sure it will give entire satisfaction so we switch to talk about other things eat our picnic meal stroll on the beach and return to crito home in the cool of the even third dialogue wednesday the follow day as we sit around the tea table in summer parlour face the garden alciphron turn down his cup sit back in his chair and say our sect be the only one on earth that have the special privilege of not be tie down by any principles while other philosophers declare themselves to be commit to certain doctrines ours assert noble freedom differ from one another and often single philosopher differ from himself among its other advantage this method of proceed make us of all men the hardest to refute you may show particular tenet of ours to be wrong but this affect only those who maintain that thesis and only for as long as they maintain it some free thinkers dogmatize more than others do and on some point more than on others the doctrine of the usefulness of vice be something we be not all agree on some of us be great admirers of virtue others have problems regard vice and virtue speak for myself think that the doctrine maintain yesterday by lysicles be an ingenious bite of theory but for various reason incline not to accept it and rather to join the virtue side in that debate that put me in the company of very small part of our sect but it may be the most thoughtful and praiseworthy part of it anyway after look into it fairly and very carefully think that we ought to prefer virtue to vice and that in do so we would be do good things for the public and for the reputation of our philosophers so you should know that number of free thinkers men who haven grain of religion in their make up be men of the most scrupulous honour which make them men of virtue honour be noble unpolluted source of virtue with absolutely no fear self interest or superstition mix in with it it have all the advantage of religion with none of the drawbacks see note on page so honour be the source of virtue ii thing can be the source of itself iii so the source have to be distinguish from whatever it be the source of iv so honour be one thing and virtue be another agree virtuous action be the effect and honour be their source or cause tell me now what the role of honour be in this be honour the will that produce the virtuous action as their efficient cause or the final cause for which they be produce or right reason that govern and control them or what the action be about or do you use honour to stand for faculty or appetite each of these be suppose to be in one way or another source of human action honour be none of them then please give me some notion or definition of it alciphron think for while and then answer that he define honour to be principle of virtuous action euphranor reply as understand it the word principle have several sense sometimes by principles we mean the part of which whole be compose and into which it can be resolve or analyse it in this sense that the elements be call principles of compound body and word and syllables and letter be the principles of speech sometimes by principle we mean small individual seed the growth or gradual unfold of which produce an organic body animal or vegetable in its proper size and shape principles in other contexts be suppose to be certain fundamental theorems in arts and sciences in religion and politics now when you say honour be principle of virtue in which if any of these sense be you use principle alciphron reply that he didn mean it in any of those sense and that he define honour to be certain ardour or enthusiasm that glow in the breast of gallant man at that time enthusiasm tend to mean something close to fanaticism which sometimes replace it in this version in the present context however it be safer to let the word stand euphranor remark that it be always legitimate to put definition in place of the term define be this allow he ask it be then can we say that man of honour be an ardent or heat man or an enthusiast alciphron reply that there no point in such exactness that pedants may dispute and define but they can never reach the high sense of honour that distinguish the fine gentleman this honour he say be thing to be felt rather than explain crito see that alciphron couldn bear be press any further on that matter and want to give some satisfaction to euphranor say that he wouldn undertake to explain such delicate matter but that he would repeat to them part of conversation he once hear between minute philosopher and christian on the same subject the report dialogue which be quite short represent the free thinker honour as disgracefully meagre affair pretty much limit to pay one gamble debts and engage in duel when challenge don want the opinion of someone of whom know nothing tell me your own judgment about what honour be base on your own observations of men of honour well from everything that have hear or see could never find that honour consider as an action stimulus distinct from conscience religion reason and virtue be anything but an empty name really do think that those who base their conduct on the notion of honour have less virtue than other men and that what they seem to have as their substitute for virtue be derive either from the fashion of the day or from conscience that have without their know it retain faint trace of the religious principles that be drum into them in their childhood these two principles source seem to account for everything that in those gentlemen men of fashion who be full of animal life be bluster braggarts when it come to morality they would blush to let anyone think that they be afraid of conscience they go on about honour and want to be know as men of honour rather than as conscientious or honest men but so far as can see this shiny glow of honour with nothing of conscience or religion beneath it to give it life and substance be no better than meteor or sunset cloud have confuse idea that honour have lot to do with truth and that men of honour be the greatest enemies of all hypocrisy falsehood and disguise quite the contrary an unbeliever who think he have the most scrupulous honour without have the least grain of faith or religion will pretend to be christian take any test join in any act of worship kneel pray receive the sacrament all to serve his own self interest he win feel that his honour be at stake when he solemnly declare and promise in the face of god and the world that he will love his wife and forsake all others keep only to her while have not the faintest intention of keep any part of his vow as he show to everyone as soon as he get her and her money in his power we have notion here in the country that call man of honour liar be the nastiest thing one could do and very risky thing to do that be very true such man doesn mind lie but he hat to be call liar alciphron have peacefully hear all this say the term free thinker cover men of very different sort and sentiments so that free thinkers can be say strictly to constitute single sect with particular system of positive and distinct opinions we do indeed all agree on certain point of unbelief certain negative principles and this agreement do in way bring us together under the common idea of one sect but those negative principles as they take root in men who differ in age temperament and upbringing produce wide variety of tendencies opinions and character don think that our greatest strength lie in the libertines and mere men of honour who constitute the majority of us no we have among us philosophers of very different type enquire thinkers who be govern not by such crude things as sense and custom but by highly principled virtue and elevate morals and the less religious they be the more virtuous an unbeliever be the best qualify person for virtue of the high and disinterested not self interest kind because it be low down and selfish thing to be virtuous through fear or hope as believers be the notion of god who maintain future state of reward and punishments may indeed tempt or scare cowardly men into behaviour that be contrary to the natural tendency of their souls but it will never produce genuine virtue to get to the bottom of things to analyse virtue into its ultimate elements and settle scheme of morals on its true basis you have to grasp that an idea of beauty be natural to the mind of man all men want beauty they be please and delight with it for its own sake purely from an instinct of nature man doesn need arguments to make him identify and approve what be beautiful it strike him at first sight and attract him without reason and just as this beauty be find in the physical feature of material things so also there different though analogous kind of beauty an order symmetry handsomeness in the moral world and just as the eye perceive one sort of beauty so do the mind by certain interior sense perceive the other sort and this sense talent or faculty be always sharpest and purest in the noblest mind just as we unhesitatingly pronounce dress to be fine or physical movement graceful we can with the same free untutored judgment tell straight off whether someone behaviour be beautiful to detect and enjoy this kind of beauty you need delicate and fine taste but when someone have this natural taste that all he need he have no need for anything else as principle to convince him of the value of beauty or as motive to induce him to love virtue and every rational creature have something of this taste or sense though in vary degrees all rational be be by nature social they be draw towards one another by natural affections they unite into families club party and commonwealths by mutual sympathy just as the various part of our body guide by the sensitive soul contribute to our animal function and be connect to make one whole organism so also the various part of these rational systems guide by this moral or interior sense be hold together have fellow feel do support and protect each other and jointly co operate towards single end that the source of our joy in society our inclination towards do good to our kind the approval and delight we have when we see other men virtuous deeds or think back on our own by think about the fitness and order of the part of moral system operate regularly and hold together by benevolent affections the mind of man achieve the highest notion of beauty excellence and perfection hold by this sublime idea our philosophers infinitely despise and pity anyone who propose or accept any other motive to virtue self interest be low down and ungenerous thing destroy the merit of virtue and falsehood of every kind be inconsistent with the genuine spirit of philosophy so your love for moral beauty and your passion for truth as such win let you patiently endure those fraudulent impositions upon mankind god the immortality of the soul and reward and punishments in an after life which purport to promote virtue but really destroy it destroy true virtue and at the same time contradict and belittle your noble theories thus tend to disturb and agitate men mind and fill them with doom hop and empty terrors men first thoughts and natural notions be the best in moral matter mankind doesn need to be preach or reason or frighten into virtue which be such natural and congenial thing for every human soul and if this be the case as it certainly be it follow that all society aim be secure without religion and that an unbeliever offer promise of be the most virtuous man in true sublime and heroic sense while you say these things alciphron feel state of my soul like the tremble of one lute when the unison string of another be pluck doubtless there be beauty of the mind charm in virtue symmetry and proportion in the moral world the ancients know this moral beauty by the name of honestum if we want to know what its force and influence be it may be worthwhile to inquire how it be understand and depict by those who first consider it and give it name honestum accord to aristotle be what be praiseworthy accord to plato it be what be pleasant or profitable mean pleasant to reasonable mind and profitable to its true interest euphranor give the key word here in greek as well as in english or in one case honestum latin see note on page when we think of an action as praiseworthy our think go beyond the bare action itself and take in the opinion of others concern it ii so this isn sufficient basis or source of virtue for man to act on in case where he think that his conduct can be observe by any other think be iii when man do something because he find it pleasant or profitable we have to think that he ll refrain from do it or even do its opposite if that have prospect of greater pleasure or profit iv so it follow from this that the beauty of virtue in either aristotle or plato sense be not sufficient to get sensual and worldly mind men to act virtuously so it follow that hope of reward and fear of punishment be extremely useful in get the balance of pleasant and profitable to swing down on the side of virtue thus bring much benefit to human society alciphron appeal gentlemen you be witness of this unfair proceed of euphranor who argue against us on the basis of plato and aristotle account of the beauty of virtue account that have nothing to do with our view the philosophers of our sect rise above all praise pleasure and self interest when they be capture and bowl over by the sublime idea of the beauty of virtue apologise reply euphranor for suppose that today minute philosophers think like those ancient sag but tell me alciphron since you don adopt plato or aristotle account of it what do you understand the beauty of virtue to be define it explain it make me understand your mean that so we can argue about the same thing if we don do that we ll never reach conclusion some things be better understand by definitions and descriptions but have always observe that those who do least well concern the beauty of virtue be those who try to define explain and dispute about it moral beauty be so unique and abstract so subtle fine and fleet that it doesn survive be handle and inspect like jug or boot so you ll have to allow me my philosophic liberty to take my stand within the general and indefinite sense rather than enter into precise and detail account of this beauty possibly lose sight of it and also possibly give you leverage for criticize and infer and raise doubt query and difficulties about something that as clear as the sun when nobody reason upon it be you then say alciphron that the notion of moral beauty be clearest when it be not think about say that it something to be felt rather than understand certain je ne sais quoi french don know what we engage with it not through our concept manage capacities but through special sense which be properly call the moral sense because it be adapt to the perception of moral beauty as the eye be adapt to colour or the ear to sound have no doubt that men naturally have certain instinctive sensations or emotions that make them amiable and useful to each other examples be fellow feel with the distress tenderness for our offspring affection towards our friends our neighbour and our country indignation against what be base cruel or unjust these emotions be implant in the human soul along with various other factor fear and appetites aversions and desire with different mind differ in which of these be strongest and uppermost doesn it then seem to be very uncertain guide in morals for man to follow his emotion or inward feel if this be the general rule wouldn it be sure to lead different men in different directions depend on which appetite or emotion be prevalent don deny that and doesn it also follow that duty and virtue be more likely to be practise if men be lead by reason and judgment balance low and sensual pleasures against those of higher kind present losses against future gain and the discomfort and disgust of every vice against the delightful practice of the opposite virtue and the please thoughts and hop that go with it or can there be stronger motive to virtue than the belief that all things consider it be in every man true self interest tell you euphranor we despise the virtue of the man who calculate and deliberate and must have reason for be virtuous the refine moralists among the free thinkers be enchant and carry away by the abstract beauty of virtue they love virtue only for its own sake try an experiment on the first man you meet propose to him villainous or unjust action get his initial sense of the matter and you ll find that he detest it he may indeed later on be mislead by arguments or overpower by temptation but his original unpremeditated genuine thoughts be right and orthodox how can we account for this except through moral sense which when leave to itself have as quick and true perception of the beauty and ugliness of human action as the eye have of colour mightn this be adequately explain in term of conscience affection emotion education reason custom religion for all know those source of moral behaviour may be what you metaphorically call moral sense what call moral sense be strictly literally and truly sense and be different in kind from all the things you have just list all men have it though some may fail to be aware of it in themselves euphranor smile and say alciphron have make discoveries where least expect him to in regard to everything else would hope to learn from him but for knowledge of myself of the faculties and power of my own mind would have look at home and might have look there for good long time without find this new talent even now after be tutor still can understand it must say that alciphron speak in way that be too high fly and obscure for topic that ought to be the most clearly understand of all have often hear that your deepest experts and oldest and most experience theoreticians be the most obscure lysicles be young and speak plainly if he would favour us with his view of the moral sense that might perhaps be nearer to level at which can understand lysicles shake his head and in solemn and earnest manner address us all gentlemen he say alciphron stand on his own legs have no part in these refine notions he be now commit to defend if must subdue my emotions take things in an abstract way think deeply love virtue in short if must be an enthusiast the deference owe to the laws of my country make me choose to be an enthusiast in their way besides it be better to be an enthusiast for some end than to be an enthusiast for none this doctrine of virtue base not on religion but on moral sense have all the solid inconvenience of the christian doctrine without its distract hop and prospect wasn count on lysicles to back me up in this matter which after all doesn need his help different topics require different treatments subject may be too obscure for the dry and pedantic method of definition and distinction draw or it may be too simple for it and we may know too little about subject to be able to make it plainer by talk about it or we may know too much for further talk to be any help for my part believe that if matter be fairly state the rational satisfaction the peace of mind the inward comfort and conscientious joy that good christian find in good action would not be find to fall short of all the ecstasy rapture and enthusiasm that be suppose to come from that high and undescribed source the moral sense seriously can any ecstasy be higher any rapture more affect than what come from the love of god and man from conscience clear of sin from an inward discharge of duty with the secret delight trust and hope that go along with it euphranor we who be devote to the truth don envy the groundless joy and mistake hop of christian we pity them and as for conscience and rational pleasure how can we allow conscience without allow vindictive god and how can we suppose that the charm of virtue consist in any pleasure or benefit that come from virtuous action without thereby give great advantage to the christian religion which seem to arouse its believers to virtue by the self interest pursuit of the highest pleasures as reward alas if we grant this we would be open the door to all those rusty old speeches about the necessity and usefulness of the great article of faith the immortality of the soul an after life reward and punishments and other such explode notions accord to our system and principles those factor may perhaps produce low popular self interest kind of virtue but it be bind to destroy and extinguish virtue in the sublime and heroic sense of the word what you re say now be perfectly intelligible wish understand your main principle as well so you be seriously at loss can you really have no notion of beauty or have it but not know beauty to be lovable in itself and for itself tell me alciphron do all mankind have the same notion of beautiful face the physical beauty of human be seem to be rather mix and various but isn there steady standard of beauty with regard to other things doesn every human mind have the idea of order harmony and proportion alciphron it weakness of mine that tend to get lose when the talk be abstract and general particular things be better suit to my faculties so let us stay with the object of the sense and try to discover what it be that make them beautiful and then use these sensible things as ladder climb to the level of moral and intellectual beauty so please tell me what be it that we call beauty in the object of sense alciphron answer would as euphranor point out allow for beauty in taste and smell so he try again with an account that limit beauty to what can be see alciphron after short pause say that beauty consist in certain symmetry or proportion please to the eye be this proportion the very same in everything or be it different in different kinds of things different doubtless the proportion of an ox would not be beautiful in horse and we see also in inanimate things that the beauty of table chair door consist in different proportion see note on page this proportion imply the relation of one thing to another ii and these relations be base on size and shape iii for the proportion to be right those mutual relations of size and shape in the part must be such as to make the whole thing complete and perfect in its kind iv thing be say to be perfect in its kind when it fit the purpose for which it be make so the part have to be relate and adjust to one another in such way that they can best work together to make the whole thing work properly vi but compare part with one another view them as belong to one whole and relate this whole to its use or purpose seem to be the work of reason vii so strictly speak proportion be not perceive by the sense of sight but only by reason through the mean of sight viii so beauty in your sense of it be an object not of the eye but of the mind ix so the eye alone can see that chair be handsome or door well proportion that seem to follow but not clear on this point let see if there any difficulty in it that chair you be sit in do you think it could be regard as well proportion or handsome if it didn have that height depth breadth and wasn adjust so as to be comfortable to sit in it could not so the beauty or symmetry of chair can be take in unless you know what the chair be for and relate its shape to that intend use and that can be do by the eye alone it work for the judgment so it be one thing to see an object and another to detect its beauty admit this to be true he now repeat the point with the example of door the standards for what make door beautifully proportion reflect the fact that doors be for humans to go through alciphron agree then tell me alciphron isn there something truly decent and beautiful in dress no doubt there be if we want to get an idea of beauty in dress be anyone more likely to give it to us than painters and sculptors whose business it be to aim at graceful representations believe not well then let examine the draperies of the great master in these arts for example how they be accustom to clothe matron or man of rank he then launch into fierce attack on current standards of dress the greeks and romans dress themselves in become manner whereas our gothic gentry have adopt standards and fashion that be absurd and ridiculous the reason for this and alciphron agree be that instead of consult use reason and convenience the moderns have go in for fancy the unnatural parent of monsters he conclude that the beauty of dress depend on its serve certain end and use euphranor then launch into fresh set of examples quote virgil on beautiful horse and then report ancient greek ideas about what make pillar beautiful there follow long speech about architectural standards all of which be aim at show the subordinate relative nature of beauty architectural beauty he say reflect not only the use to which the build be to be put but also certain relationships to natural things the proportion that make for beauty in greek pillar have definite relationship to the proportion of well shape human body euphranor sum up the grand distinction between ancient greek and gothic architecture be that the gothic be fantastical and mostly not base on nature or reason necessity or use these be what account for all the beauty grace and ornament of the architecture of ancient greece what euphranor have say confirm the opinion always entertain that the rule of architecture as of all other arts that flourish among the greeks be base on truth and nature and good sense he then expound the point that the ancients didn adhere slavishly to their rule of proportion etc be will to depart from them whenever the particular distance position elevation or dimension of the build or its part seem to require it he contrast careful and rational departure from rule with the capricious fantasticalness of contemporary architecture now need something to be make clearer namely what the point be of this architectural detour weren we enquire into beauty we be well what do you think alciphron doesn some real principle of beauty have to be at work when something please us here and now and also give pleasure two thousand years ago and two thousand miles away yes it do and isn that how things stand with respect to sound piece of architecture nobody deny it architecture the noble offspring of judgment and fancy be gradually form in the most civilise and inform countries of asia and in egypt greece and italy it be value and admire by the most flourish state and most renowned monarchs who at vast expense improve it and bring it to perfection it seem more than any other art to be specially involve with order proportion and symmetry so isn it reasonable for us to think that architecture be the art that be most likely to help us get some rational notion of the je ne sais quoi in beauty and haven we learn from our detour that there be no beauty without proportion and that proportion be to be judge as sound and true only to the extent that they relate appropriately to some certain use or purpose this potential usefulness be what basically make them please and charm admit all this to be true in the next three speeches principle be use in sense relate to in euphranor speech on page think of it as mean approximately generator or source of energy give this doctrine like to know what beauty can be find in moral system that have be form tie together and govern by chance fate or any other blind unthinking principle without think there can be no purpose or design without purpose there can be any usefulness and without usefulness there can be any of the fitness of proportion from which beauty spring can we suppose that the world be permeate throughout by certain vital principle of beauty order and harmony without suppose god who inspect punish and reward the moral action of men without suppose the immortality of the soul or an after life in brief without accept any part of what be commonly call faith worship and religion be this principle that you be suppose think one or not if not then it be all of piece with chance or fate which be argue against moment ago if it do think then like alciphron to tell me what be so beautiful in moral system head by supreme think be that doesn protect the innocent punish the wicked or reward the virtuous he go on eloquently and at length about the beauty of moral system in which everyone see himself as the member of great city whose author and founder be god and where all conduct aim at the noblest end namely the complete happiness or well be of the whole then there will be great beauty in system of spirit that be subordinate to god will and under his direction with him govern them by laws and direct them by methods that be suitable to wise and good end but how can there be beauty in an incoherent system that be govern by chance or in blind system that be govern by fate or in any system where god doesn preside where there be no think there be no design and therefore no order and therefore no beauty contrast these two scenes man be conscious that his will be inwardly conform to god will which produce order and harmony in the universe and conduct the whole by the most just methods to the best end that give beautiful idea but then man be conscious that his virtue be overlook neglect or hold against him by men and not regard or reward by god that this world have treat him badly and he have no hope or prospect of be better treat in another world where the beauty in that what pleasure can we get from think about it and how could any sane person think that spread this idea of our moral situation be the way to spread or propagate virtue in the world an enthusiast may entertain himself with visions and fine talk about such system but when it come to be consider by careful thinkers with cool head don think they will find any beauty or perfection in it and they win think that such moral system can possibly be the work of the same divine hand as the natural world throughout which there shin so much order harmony and proportion all this serve to confirm me in my opinion say earlier page that regard this high level beauty of morality man first thoughts be best and that we ll risk lose sight of it if we examine inspect and reason about it that there be such thing can be doubt when we realize that some of our philosophers today have high sense of virtue without the least notion of religion that be clear proof of the usefulness and effectiveness of our principles grant that some minute philosophers be virtuous we may venture to question the cause of their virtue you attribute it to an inexplicable enthusiastic notion of moral beauty think it come as euphranor say from personal temperament custom and religious education but anyway assign what beauty you please to virtue in an irreligious system it can be less in religious one unless you hold that virtue charm diminish as her dowry increase take all the motives of every sort that an unbeliever can possibly get from the beauty of virtue believer can have them too as well as other motives that an unbeliever doesn have so it be obvious that those of your sect who have moral virtue don get it from their special free think doctrines which serve only to lessen the motives to virtue good free thinkers be less good and bad ones be more bad than they would have be if they be believers it seem to me that those heroic unbelieving lovers of abstract moral beauty be much to be pity and much to be amaze by lysicles break in impatiently gentlemen he say you shall have my whole thoughts about this topic plain and unvarnished everything that be say about moral sense or about moral beauty in any mean of that phrase whether say by alciphron or euphranor or anyone else regard as basically mere window dress and pretence the beautiful and the decent be outward things and be relative and superficial they have no effect in the dark as they would if there be something solid about them they be merely show piece to argue over and make speeches about as some of the self announce members our sect be accustom to do orthodox though they be about other things but if one of them get into power you wouldn find him such fool as euphranor imagine he would soon show that he have learn that the love of one country be prejudice that mankind be rogues and hypocrites and that it would be folly to sacrifice oneself for the sake of the like of them that everything that matter relate to this life and that because to every man this life mean his own life it clearly follow that charity begin at home claim be make of benevolence to mankind but what wise people put into practice be benevolence to themselves among our free thinker philosophers the livelier ones don hesitate to accept these maxims openly and as for the more solemn ones we can guess what they must really think if they be true to their principles whatever effect pure theory may have on certain minority of very unusual mind or in some other part of the world really do think that in england now reason religion and law be all together little enough to get people to act in accordance with their consciences and that it would be downright stupid to think that without reason religion and law men would be in love with the golden mean in love with temperate way of life one in which extremes be avoid indeed my countrymen may be even less incline to be like that than others be because in the make up of an english mind there be certain hot eagerness that carry us to the sad extreme in religion to fanaticism in free think to atheism in liberty to rebellion he go on to say that the english like other northern people don go in for beauty much and when they try they make hash of it wind up but in no case be it to be hop that the beautiful he say it in greek will be the lead idea of the great majority who have quick sense strong emotions and blunt intellects the fewer they be the more we should respect and admire such philosophers whose souls be transport by this sublime idea of moral beauty but then one might expect from such philosophers enough good sense and philanthropy to make them keep their tenets to themselves and consider the situation of their weak brethren who be more strongly affect by notions of another kind than that of the beauty of pure disinterested virtue consider the example of cratylus what follow be aim at the third earl of shaftesbury who be berkeley target not always fairly treat through much of this work he be prejudice against the christian religion be of an unsound constitution have rank in society higher than most men can even aim at have fortune equal to his rank have little capacity for sensual vices or temptation to dishonest ones he talk himself or think he have into stoic enthusiasm about the beauty of virtue then under the pretence of make men heroically virtuous he try by undermine religion to destroy the mean of make them reasonably and humanly so this be clear example of the fact that neither birth nor book nor conversation can introduce knowledge of the world into conceited mind that will attend only to itself and look at mankind only in its own mirror cratylus be lover of liberty and of his country he aim to make men uncorrupt and virtuous on the purest and most disinterested principles it true that the main aim of all his write as he himself tell us be to assert the reality of beauty and charm in moral subject as well as in natural ones to demonstrate taste that he think more effective than principle to recommend morals on the same basis as manners and in this way to make progress in moral philosophy by give it the same basis as the notions of what be agreeable and socially acceptable as for religious qualms the belief in an after life of reward and punishments and such matter this great man doesn hesitate to declare that the liberal polish and refine part of mankind must consider them only as children tales and pastimes of the vulgar so for the sake of the better sort of people he have in his great goodness and wisdom think of something else namely taste or flavour this he assure us be something that will influence people because accord to him anyone who have any impression of gentility or polish be so acquaint with the fittingness and grace of things as to be easily bowl over by the think of it his conduct seem to be about as wise as that of monarch who announce that in his kingdom there be no jail and no executioner to enforce the laws but that it be beautiful to obey the laws and that in do so men will taste the pure delight that result from order and decorum yet isn it true that certain ancient philosophers ones of great note hold the same opinion as cratylus declare that no one count as good man if he practise virtue for any reason except that it be beautiful yes think some of the ancients say things that give rise to this opinion aristotle distinguish between two ways in which someone can be good man one he call agathos or simply good the other he call kalos kagathos these be hard to translate into english but his sense be plainly this agathos be the man to whom the good things of nature be good accord to aristotle things that be vulgarly regard as the greatest goods riches honour power and bodily perfections be indeed good by nature and yet they happen to be hurtful and bad to some people because of their bad habit so that those natural goods be not good for fool an unjust man or an intemperate man any more than sick man be help by get nourishment that be proper for those who be in good health and kalos kagathos be the man in whom be to be find all things worthy and decent and praiseworthy purely as such and for their own sake and who practise virtue solely because of his love of virtue innate beauty aristotle also observe that there be certain political way of think and behave that the spartans and others have who think that virtue be to be value and practise because of the natural advantage that come with it this make them good men he say but they don have the supreme consummate virtue this make it clear that accord to aristotle someone can be good man without believe that virtue its own reward or be move to virtue only by the sense of moral beauty it also clear that he distinguish the political virtue of nations which the public be everywhere concern to maintain from this high mind and theoretical kind of virtue notice also that his high level kind of virtue be consistent with suppose providence that inspect and reward the virtues of the best men he say if the gods care at all about human affairs as they seem to it seem reasonable to suppose that they be most delight with the part of our nature that be most excellent and most like their own natures namely our mind and that they will reward those who chiefly love and cultivate what be most dear to them he remark that the majority of mankind be naturally incline to be awe not by shame but by fear and to abstain from vicious conduct not because of its ugliness but only because of the punishment it bring all this show us very clearly what aristotle would have think of those who would set to work to lessen or destroy mankind hop and fear in order to make them virtuous purely because of the beauty of virtue well whatever aristotle and his followers think isn it certain that the stoics maintain this doctrine in its highest sense assert that the beauty of virtue be all sufficient that virtue be her own reward that only virtue could make man happy despite all the things that be vulgarly regard as the greatest woes and miseries of human life and they hold all this while also believe that the soul of man be some kind of material thing which at death be dissipate like flame or vapour yes the stoics do sometimes talk as if they believe the soul to be mortal in deal with this topic in one of his letter seneca speak much like minute philosopher but in several other place he declare himself to have the outright opposite opinion assert that men souls after death rise into the heavens and look down on earth crito then talk learnedly about marcus aurelius he sometimes speak of the soul as perish or scatter but for him the soul be rather low part of man to be distinguish from his mind or govern principle at man death accord to him the mind remain intact it be particle of god which go back whole to the star and the divinity conclude thus along with all his magnificent lessons and splendid view about the force and beauty of virtue marcus be positive about the existence of god in the strict sense of providence inspect and take care of human affairs despite their high style therefore the stoics can be say to have reduce every motive for live virtuously to just one the beauty of virtue in such way as to attempt to destroy people belief in the immortality of the soul and providence that hand out reward and punishments and anyway suppose that the disinterested stoics do make virtue its own and its only reward take this in the most rigid and absolute sense what do that imply for those of us who be not stoics if we adopt all the principles of that sect accept their notions of good and evil their famous indifference to suffer in short set ourselves up as complete stoics that may enable us to maintain this doctrine of virtue for its own sake with better grace at least it will fit consistently into our whole stoic scheme of things but if you borrow this splendid patch from the stoics hop to make big impression by insert it into modern composition spice with the wit and notions of the present day you ll make an impression all right but on the mind of wise man it may not be the impression you intend though must admit that although embroider stoic patch with joke ought to make you look ridiculous you might get away with it because the present age be very indulgent to everything that aim at mockery of religion not everyone like humorous write and not everyone can produce them the truth be that the variety in readers taste require variety of kinds of writers our sect have provide for this with great judgment to spread our word to people of the more serious sort we have men who can reason and argue deeply and well for the run of the mill general read public we have writers who produce lengthy rhetorically persuasive piece and for men of rank and social polish we have the finest and wittiest mockers in the world whose ridicule be the sure test of truth this refer to shaftesbury who in his book characteristics of men manners opinions time write about wit and humour in philosophy see note on page no doubt that ingenious mockers be knowledgeable men ii they know about the copernican theory of the planets the circulation of the blood and so on iii they believe that there be land in the far south of the southern hemisphere that there be mountains on the moon that the earth move iv if five or six centuries ago man have maintain these notions among the clever wits at an english court they would have be receive with ridicule whereas now it would be ridiculous to ridicule them vi yet truth be the same then as it be now vii so it seem that ridicule be not such secure test of truth as you gentlemen imagine one thing we do know our mockery and sarcasm infuriate the black tribe of priests and theologians and that be our comfort something else that it may be worthwhile for you to know men who be double over with laughter may be applaud piece of mockery that they ll find contemptible when they recover from their laugh fit well anyway this much be certain our clever men make convert by deride the principles of religion and can assure you that mockery be the most successful and please method of convince someone these author laugh men out of their religion as the latin poet horace laugh them out of their vices but bigot can enjoy their wit indeed he can detect it crito speak slightingly of wit without wisdom then move back to the centre of their topic of conversation cite examples from ancient rome of good able people whose attitude to virtue involve their belief in an after life in which virtue be reward alciphron reply that these men be very well for their time but that they didn achieve the high level kind of virtue that our modern free thinkers have so it should seem that virtue flourish more than ever among us it should and this abundant virtue be to be explain by the way in which your profound writers go about recommend it this grant but you have admit that enthusiastic lovers of virtue be not majority in your sect but only small select minority alciphron didn answer this but crito step in to make true estimate of the worth and growth of modern virtue he say to euphranor what you should go by be not the number of virtuous men but rather the quality of their virtue and the virtue of these refine free think theorists be so pure and genuine that very little of it go long way in fact it be invaluable there no comparison between it and the reasonable self interest virtue of the english of earlier time or of the spartans turn of phrase which could mean that this kind of morality be very powerful and so wonderful as to be above all price and incomparably better than the morality of the spartans etc but which could instead mean that the less we see of it the better and it be worthless and be it incomparably worse that the morality of the spartans etc see note on page there be diseases of the soul as well as of the body ii the diseases of the soul be vicious habit iii and just as bodily ailments be cure by medicine mental ailments be cure by philosophy iv so it seem that philosophy be medicine for the soul of man the way we judge concern medicine decide which ones to prefer be from the effect they bring about vi suppose that in the middle of an epidemic new physician condemn the know establish practice and recommend another method of cure and suppose that some people have plausible things to say in support of this proposal wouldn you be incline to let your attitude to it be govern by whatever difference it make to the mortality figure all you be do be create confusion and take us away from our topic this remind me of my friend lamprocles who need only one argument against unbelievers have notice he tell me that as unbelief grow so do corruption of every kind as well as new vices this simple observation of matter of fact be enough to make him fill the mind of his children from an early age with the principles of religion despite the protest of many clever men the new theories that our clever moderns have try to substitute for religion have run their full course in our time and have produce their effect on the mind and conduct of men that men be men be sure maxim but it equally sure that englishmen be not the same men that they be and you don need me to tell you whether they be better or worse more or less virtuous than they use to be everyone can see and judge that for himself whatever the consequences may be can never bring myself to agree with those who measure truth by convenience the only god worship be truth wherever it lead shall follow so you have passion for truth undoubtedly for all truths for all to know them or to publish them both what would you busily correct the procedures of an enemy who be go about his attack in the wrong way would you help an enrage man to take out his sword in such case common sense tell one how to behave so common sense should be consult about whether truth be salutary or hurtful fit to be declare or fit to be conceal how you would have me conceal and stifle the truth and keep it to myself be that what you aim at only draw an obvious conclusion from things you say as for myself don believe that your opinions be true you do but if you be go to be consistent with yourself you shouldn think it necessary or wise to publish hurtful truths just because they be true what service can it do mankind to lessen the motives to virtue and what harm can it do to increase them none in the world but have to say that can square the accept notions of god and providence with my understand and be just naturally revolt by the lowness of pretend not to notice falsehood shall we therefore appeal to truth and examine the reason that hold you back from believe in god and providence with all my heart but that be enough for just now let make this the subject of our next conversation fourth dialogue thursday as look out of my window early the next morning saw alciphron walk in the garden with all the sign of man in deep think go down to him alciphron say this early and profound meditation frighten me why because would be sorry to be convince that there be no god the think of anarchy in nature be more shock to me than the think of anarchy in civil life because natural concern be more important than civil ones and be the basis of all the others grant reply alciphron that some inconvenience might follow from disprove the existence of god but as for what you say of fright and shock all that be nothing but prejudice mere prejudice men form an idea or fanciful picture in their own mind and then bow down and worship it notions govern mankind but no other notion have take such deep root or spread so widely as the notion of god govern the world so it an heroic achievement by philosophy to unthrone this imaginary monarch and banish all those fear and spectres that only the light of reason can dispel it will be my role say to stand by as have do up to now take note of everything that happen during this memorable event the attempt of less than six feet tall minute philosopher to dethrone the monarch of the universe they kick this around little and then be join by euphranor and by crito who remark that with alciphron have make such an early start we can expect to see atheism place in the best light and support by the strongest arguments then they get straight on with it not even find somewhere to sit down the existence of god be subject on which countless commonplaces have be utter there no need for me to repeat them so allow me lay down certain rule and limitations so as to shorten this conversation the aim of debate be to persuade so anything that win persuade should be leave out of our debate here be three limitations on arguments against me can be persuade by metaphysical arguments such as those from the idea of an all perfect be or from the absurdity of an infinite chain of cause have always find arguments of this sort dry and thin and because they aren suit to my way of think they may puzzle me but they ll never convince me can be persuade by the authority either of past age or our present time the authority of mankind in general or of particular wise men none of that count for much with man who argue soundly and think freely arguments base on the utility or convenience of the belief in god be beside the point they may indeed prove the usefulness of the belief but not the existence of the thing the rigorous eye of philosopher can see that truth and convenience be very different things whatever legislators or statesmen may think so that win seem bias also propose two limitations on arguments that can use on my side win argue from anything that may seem irregular or unaccountable in the work of nature to the conclusion that nature be not cause by infinite power and wisdom already know how you would answer such an argument if do use it namely by say that no one can judge the symmetry and use of the part of an infinite machine whose appropriateness and usefulness depend on how they relate to each other and to the whole without have grasp of the entire machine the whole universe undertake not to argue from premise about the harm that good men suffer and the prosperity that wicked men often enjoy in this life if do argue in that way know how you would reply instead of admit this as good argument against the existence of god you would make it an argument for an after life in which reward and punishments will be distribute in ways that vindicate the divine attribute and set everything right at the end by not use those arguments deprive you of an opportunity to give those answer but there be no unfairness in that even if the answer be good ones they aren arguments for the existence of god all they do be to solve certain difficulties that might be bring against the existence of god on the assumption that it have already be prove by proper arguments think should specify all this so as to save us all time and trouble what we should be aim at here be the discovery and defence of truth and truth may be justify not only by persuade its adversaries but also if they can be persuade by show them to be unreasonable so an argument that shed light will have its effect even against an opponent who shut his eye because it will show him to be obstinate and prejudice anyway minute philosophers be less attentive than anyone to this distinction between arguments that puzzle and arguments that convince so the distinction needn be respect by others in their favour but euphranor may be will to encounter you on your own term in which case have nothing more to say alciphron act like skillful general who work to get the advantage of the grind and entice the enemy to come out of their trench we who believe in god be entrench in tradition custom authority and law but alciphron do not try to dislodge us instead he propose that we should voluntarily abandon these entrenchments and attack him when we could easily and securely act on the defensive leave him the trouble to dispossess us of what we need not resign the reason that you have muster up in your early morning meditation he continue address alciphron if they don weaken our belief in god must help to strengthen it for the utmost be to be expect from such great master in his profession when he really get to work on something regard the confuse notion of deity or supreme invisible power to be the most unconquerable of all prejudice when half dozen able men get together over glass of wine in well light room we easily banish all the spectres of imagination or upbringing and be very clear about what we think and why but as be take solitary walk before it be broad daylight this morning the issue seem not quite so clear and couldn bring to mind the force of the arguments that have usually appear so conclusive at other time experience strange kind of awe and seem haunt by sort of panic which can account for except by suppose it to be the effect of prejudice you see like the rest of the world be once long time ago drill and tutor into the belief in god there be no surer mark of prejudice than believe something without any reason so what need be there for me to set myself the difficult task of prove negative when it be sufficient for me to point out that there be no proof of the affirmative and that accept it without proof be unreasonable so go ahead and prove your opinion if you can you may indeed continue to have it but what you have will be merely prejudice alciphron if we be to content you we must prove it seem and we must do it on your term well for start let us see what sort of proof you expect the sort of proof demand not say expect it be the sort that every intelligent man require for any matter of fact or for the existence of any particular thing other than himself why do believe there be king of great britain because have see him or king of spain because have see people who saw him but as for this king of kings haven see him myself nor have see anyone else who have see him if there be such thing as god surely it very strange that he have leave himself without witness that men should still be argue about his existence and that there should be not single evident sensible plain proof of his existence without have to bring in philosophy or metaphysics matter of fact have to be prove not by notions but by facts you see what be up to these be the principles on the basis of which defy superstition so you believe as far as you can see that be my rule of faith what you win believe in the existence of things that you hear unless you also see them no that wrong when insist on see mean to be talk about perceive in general outward object make very different impressions on the animal spirit impressions that be lump together under the common label sense and whatever we can perceive by any sense we may be sure of widely accept theory go back at least as far as descartes hold that the work of animal body involve animal spirit envisage as extremely fine and fluid matter that can get through hole that be too small to let even air pass through so you believe that there be such things as animal spirit doubtless what sense do you perceive them by don perceive them immediately by any of my sense but be convince of their existence because can infer it from their effect and operations they be the messengers which run to and fro in the nerve enable outward object to affect the soul so you admit the existence of soul provide don admit an immaterial substance see no drawback to allow that there may be such thing as soul it may be no more than thin fine texture of super fine part or spirit reside in the brain not ask about its nature only ask whether you accept that there be source of think and action and whether it be perceivable by sense grant that there be such source and that it isn itself an object of sense but we infer it from appearances that be perceive by sense see note on page if understand you rightly from animal function and motion you infer the existence of animal spirit and from reasonable act you infer the existence of reasonable soul ii so it seem that the existence of things that can be perceive through the sense can be infer from sensible effect and sign iii the soul be what make the principal distinction between real person and shadow between live man and carcass iv so can know that you for instance be distinct think individual live real man except by infer from certain sign that you have soul all act that be immediately and properly perceive by sense come down to motion vi so from motion you infer mover or cause and from reasonable motion or such as appear calculate for reasonable end you infer rational cause soul or spirit vii now the soul of man drive only small body an insignificant particle by comparison with the great mass of nature the elements the heavenly body the system of the world and the wisdom that appear in the motion that be the effect of human reason be incomparably less than the wisdom that reveal itself in the structure and use of organize natural body animal or plant man can make with his hand machine as admirable as the hand itself and none of the motion by which we trace out human reason come anywhere near to the skill and ingenuity of the wonderful motion of the heart brain and other vital part that don depend on the will of man viii so it follow that from natural motion that be independent of man will we can infer both power and wisdom incomparably greater than that of the human soul ix furthermore in natural productions and effect there be visible unity of plan and design the rule of nature be fix and immovable the same laws of motion apply throughout the same in china and here the same two thousand years ago and today and from the mutual respect influence subordinations and use involve in the way animals relate to plant animals and plant relate to the elements and elements relate to heavenly body we can infer that they be all part of one whole all work towards the same end and fulfil the same design suppose all this to be true win it then follow that this vastly great perhaps infinite power and wisdom must be suppose to be in one single agent spirit or mind and that our certainty of the existence of this infinitely wise and powerful spirit be at least as clear full and immediate as our certainty of the existence of any one human soul apart from our own let me think suspect we proceed too hastily remember that in the original version alciphron give consecutive series of nine positive answer it be it may grant it be and so on what do you claim that you can have the same assurance of the existence of god that you can have of my existence when you actually see me stand in front of you and talk to you the very same assurance if not greater how do you support that the phrase the person alciphron mean an individual think thing not the hair skin or visible surface or any part of the outward form colour or shape of alciphron this grant in grant that you grant that strictly speak don see alciphron that individual think thing but only visible sign and tokens that suggest and imply the existence of that invisible source of think or soul in exactly the same way it seem to me that though can with my physical eye see the invisible god do in the strictest sense see and perceive by all my sense the sign and tokens effect and operations that suggest and indicate and demonstrate the existence of an invisible god do this as certainly and make it at least as evident as any sign suggest to me the existence of your soul spirit or think principle be convince that your soul exist by few sign or effect and the movements of one small organic body whereas be always and everywhere perceive sensible sign that point to the existence of god so the thesis that you doubt or deny at the outset now seem obviously to follow from the premise throughout this whole inquiry haven we carefully think about every step we take not move to accept any proposition that wasn clearly evident you and examine and assent to each forego proposition one by one so what should we do with the conclusion speak for myself if you don come to my rescue shall absolutely have to accept the conclusion as true so if live and die as believer in god you ll have to take the blame have to admit that don readily find an answer there seem to be some foundation for what you say but if this matter be as clear as you claim it be can not conceive how so many able men of our sect of free thinkers should be so much in the dark that they don know or believe one syllable of it alciphron it not our present business to explain the oversights or vindicate the honour of those great men the free thinkers when their very existence be in danger of be call in question how so remember your concessions and then show me if the arguments for god be not conclusive what better argument you have to prove the existence of the think thing which in strictness constitute the free thinker alciphron stop in his track and stand in posture of meditation while the rest of us continue our walk after little while he re join us with smile face like someone who have make some discovery have find he say something that may clear up the point in dispute and completely answer euphranor challenge mean an argument that will prove the existence of free thinker but can be adapt to prove the existence of god this idea of yours that we perceive the existence of god as certainly and immediately as we do that of human person be more than could swallow though have to admit that it puzzle me until have think it through at first think that particular structure shape or motion might be the most certain proof of think reasonable soul but little attention satisfy me that these things have no necessary connection with reason knowledge and wisdom perhaps they be certain proof of live soul but they can be certain proof of think and reasonable one on second thoughts and after minute examination of this point have find that nothing so much convince me of the existence of another person as his speak to me it hear you talk that be the best strict and philosophical argument have for your existence and this be restrict argument that can be adapt to your purpose for you win claim that god speak to man in the same clear and audible way as one man speak to another will you what be the impression of sound so much more evident than that of other sense and if it be be the voice of man louder than that of thunder you be miss the point what talk about be not the sheer sound of speech but language we have perceptible sign that don resemble and aren necessarily connect with the things they signify the way we use them be arbitrary in the sense of be choose by us rather than lay down in the nature of things and what we use them for be to suggest and exhibit to the mind of others an endless variety of things that differ in nature time and place thereby give one another information entertainment and direction for how to act with regard to near and present things and also distant and future things whether these sign be pronounce and hear or write and see they have the same use and be equally proof of an intelligent think design cause but what if it should appear that god really speak to man would this content you don accept stories about inward speech holy instincts or indications of light or spirit men of good sense regard all that as nothing to achieve something on this topic you ll need to make it plain to me that god speak to men by outward perceptible sign of the same kind and in the same way as have define well if show it to be plainly the case that god speak to men through arbitrary outward perceptible sign that don resemble and aren necessarily connect with the things they stand for and suggest and that by countless combinations of these sign an endless variety of things be reveal and make know to us and that through this we be instruct or inform about the different natures of things be teach and warn about what to avoid and what to pursue and be tell how to regulate our movements and how to act with respect to things that be far off in space or in the future will this satisfy you it just the thing challenge you to prove for it incorporate the force and use and nature of language see note on page look alciphron you can see castle on that hill over there ii it be long way away iii thing distance from oneself be line turn endwise to the eye iv and line in that situation can project more than one single point on the bottom of the eye so the appearance of long distance have the same size as the appearance of short one or rather neither of them have any size at all because always what you have at the eye be single point vi it follow from this that distance be not immediately perceive by the eye vii so it must be perceive by the mediation of some other thing viii to discover what this mediator this intermediate item be let us examine how the appearance of an object change as it be place at different distance from the eye find by experience that as an object be move further and further away from me its visible appearance become lesser and fainter and this change of appearance seem to be what we go by in take in differences of distance ix but littleness or faintness don seem in themselves to be necessarily connect with greater distance so it only because of our experience that littleness and faintness suggest or be sign of distance that be to say we don perceive distance immediately we perceive it through the mediation of sign that doesn resemble it and isn necessarily connect with it but only suggest it on the basis of repeat experience as word suggest things wait bite euphranor ve just remember that writers on optics tell us of an angle that the two optic ax make where they meet at the object be look at the more obtuse this angle be the nearer it show the object to be and the more acute the angle the further away the object be and this hold not as something arbitrary that we learn by experience but as necessary connection that can be demonstrate so the mind discover how far away things be by geometry it do wouldn it follow then that the only people who could see be those who have learn geometry and know something of line and angle there sort of natural geometry that be acquire without learn but alciphron in order to construct proof of any kind or deduce conclusion from premise don have to perceive how the term be connect with one another in the premise and how the premise be connect with the conclusion more generally if be to know one thing by mean of another thing don first have to know when perceive your mean by your word don have first to perceive the word themselves and in any inference don have to know the premise before infer the conclusion all this be true thus whoever infer nearer distance from wider angle or further distance from an acuter angle must first perceive the angle themselves someone who doesn perceive those angle can infer anything from them can he it be as you say now ask the first man you meet whether he perceive or know anything of those optic angle or whether he ever think about them or infer anything from them whether by natural or by artificial geometry how would you expect him to answer candidly think he would answer that he know nothing of those matter so it can be true that men judge distance by angle and that remove all the force from your argument to prove that distance be perceive by mean of something that have necessary connection with it agree with you it seem to me that man can know whether or not he perceive thing and if he do perceive it he can know whether he do this immediately or mediately and if he perceive it mediately he can know whether he be do this by mean of something like or unlike the thing necessarily or arbitrarily connect with it it seem so and isn it certain that if distance be not perceive immediately just by itself or by mean of any image that resemble it or by mean of any line and angle that have necessary connection with it it be perceive only by mean of experience it be from the things have say and you have agree to doesn it seem to follow that before man have any experience he wouldn imagine that the things he saw be at any distance from him what show me the smallness or faintness of appearance or any other idea or sensation that doesn resemble distance and isn necessarily connect with it can suggest differences of distance can suggest anything about distance to mind that hasn experience connection between those things and distance any more than word can suggest notions to man before he have learn the language agree that that true then doesn it follow that man who be bear blind and be then enable to see would when he first gain his sight take the things he saw to be not at any distance from him but rather in his eye or in his mind have to admit that this seem right and yet find it hard to believe that if be in such state would think that the object now see at such great distance be at no distance at all so you do now think that the object of sight be at distance from you certainly do can anyone question that that castle over there be at great distance tell me alciphron can you pick out the doors windows and battlements of that same castle can at this distance it seem only small round tower but have visit the castle and know that it not small round tower but large square build with battlements and turrets that you evidently don see what do you infer from that infer that the object that you strictly and properly perceive by sight be not the very same thing as the one that be several miles distant why so because little round object be one thing and great square object be another isn that right can deny it tell me isn the proper object of sight the thing that we actually strictly immediately see the visible appearance it be what do you now think about the visible appearance of the moon up there isn it round shin flat thing no bigger than sixpence what if it be well tell me what you think about the moon itself don you think of it as vast opaque globe with many hill and valleys do then how can you think that the proper object of your sight exist at distance admit that don know to convince you even more consider that crimson cloud in the east do you think that if you be in it you would perceive anything like what you now see by no mean all would see be dark mist isn it clear then that the castle the moon and the cloud that you see here be not the real castle moon and cloud that you suppose exist at distance what be to think then do we see anything at all or be the visual side of our live nothing but fancy and illusion here be the bottom line as understand it the proper object of sight be light and colour with their many hue and degrees of saturation and of brightness these can be vary and put together in countless different ways form language that be wonderfully adapt to indicate and exhibit to us the distance shape locations size and various qualities of tangible object ones we can perceive through our sense of touch the object of sight don resemble the tangible things nor be they necessarily connect with them the association of sight with touch be due to god choose it it like the association between word and the things signify by them what don we strictly speak perceive by sight such things as tree house men rivers and so on we do indeed perceive or apprehend those things by the faculty of sight but it doesn follow from this they be the proper and immediate object of sight any more than that all the things that be signify by the help of speak word or sound be the proper and immediate object of hear so you want us to think that light shade and colour variously combine correspond to the many articulations of sound in language and that by mean of them all sort of object be suggest to the mind through the eye in the same way that they be suggest by word or sound through the ear not through logical inference by the faculty of judgment and not through similarities that be pick up by the imagination but purely and solely from experience custom and habit don want you to think anything more than the nature of things oblige you to think don want you to submit in the least to my judgment but only to the force of truth and doubt if even the freest thinkers will claim to be exempt from that constraint you have lead me step by step to place where be lose but ll try to get out again if not by the way come then by some other that find for myself short pause then tell me euphranor wouldn it follow from these principles that man who have be bear blind and be then enable to see would at first sight not only not perceive how far away men and tree etc be from him but also not perceive that they be men and tree surely this be absurd agree that the principles we have both accept do imply that such man would never think of men tree or any other object that he have be accustom to perceive only by touch at the stage of his development that we be talk about his mind would be fill with new sensations of light and colour whose various combinations he wouldn yet understand or know the mean of any more than chinese person on first hear the word man and tree would think of men and tree in each case there have to be time and experience in which repeat events would enable him to acquire habit of know how the sign be connect with the things that be signify to enable him to understand the language whether the language of the eye or the language of the ears see nothing absurd in all this the phrase the language of the eye refer not to human language as write down but to god language in which the visual appearances of things inform us about their distance and their tactual qualities in strict philosophical truth therefore see that rock only in the sense in which hear that rock when hear the word rock be utter in the very same sense then why be it that everyone will say that he see rock or house when those things be before his eye whereas nobody will say that he hear rock or house when he hear and understand the word rock or house and second point if vision be only language speak to the eye when do men learn this language it pretty difficult task to learn the mean of all the sign that make up language but no one will say that he have devote time and trouble to learn this language of vision that not surprise if we have be all practise this language ever since our first entrance into the world if god constantly speak to the eye of all mankind even in their earliest infancy whenever their eye be open in the light it doesn seem to me at all strange that men aren aware they ever learn language that they begin on so early and practise so constantly as this language of vision remember also that it be the same language throughout the whole world and not differ in different place as other languages do so we can understand how men might mistake the connection between the proper object of sight and the things they signify for some kind of similarity or necessary relation and even how they might take them to be the same things euphranor then point out that our conscious mind tend overlook things that we be in fact steer by when they be extremely familiar for example you ve be read this page without consciously attend to the individual letter of which the word be make up alciphron grumble that euphranor point be too dry and tedious for gentleman attention crito snap back at him alciphron reply try to lower the temperature and then to cut short this squabble resume the discussion put it fairly to your own conscience do you really think that god himself speak every day and in every place to the eye of all men that be really and truly what think and you should think it too if you be consistent with yourself and stand by your own definition of language you can deny that the great mover and author of nature constantly explain himself to the eye of men by mean of perceptible arbitrary sign that have no resemblance or necessary connection with the things signify so that by compound and arrange them to suggest and exhibit an endless variety of object of different kinds in different time and place thereby inform and direct men how to act with respect to distant and future things as well as near and present ones the compound and arrange part of this be offer as analogous to construct sentence out of word there will soon be good deal more about this these be your view as well as mine and their consequence be that you have as much reason to think god speak to your eye as you can have for think that any give person speak to your ears can help think that some fallacy run throughout this whole line of argument though can easily put finger on it it seem to me that every other sense have as good claim as vision to be call language smell and taste for example be sign that inform us of other qualities to which they have neither resemblance nor necessary connection certainly they be sign there be general concept of sign that cover the part of language as well as all those other sign but equally certainly not all sign be language not even all significant sound such as the natural cry of animals or the inarticulate sound and interjections of men the true nature of language consist in the articulation combination variety copiousness extensive and general use and easy application of sign and all of these be commonly find in vision as well as in languages more conventionally so call other sense may indeed provide sign but those sign have no more right to be think to be language than inarticulate sound such as pain grunt or surprise whistle wait let me see in language the sign be arbitrary aren they they be and consequently they don always suggest real matter of fact because people sometimes say things that be false whereas this natural language of vision as you call it or these visible sign do always suggest things in the same uniform way and have the same constant regular connection with matter of fact which seem to imply that their connection with what they signify be necessary which would mean they weren language after all accord to the definition of language that we have be work with how do you solve this objection you can solve it yourself with the help of picture or mirror you re right see there be nothing in it when look at certain picture receive visual statement that there yellow tiger on that wall and there isn when look in mirror receive visual statement that there beard old man star at me and there isn this simple point really do counter alciphron view that visual statements be necessarily connect with tangible realities don know what else to say about this view of yours other than that it so odd and contrary to my way of think that ll never assent to it remember please your own lecture about prejudice and apply them in the present case maybe they will help you to follow where reason lead and to be suspicious of notions that be strongly rivet without ever have be examine indignantly reject the suspicion of prejudice not speak only for myself know club of extremely able men the freest from prejudice of any men alive who hate the notion of god and sure would be very able to untie this knot dion our narrator speak up here remark that alciphron reliance on others be unworthy of him and of his principles as well as be dangerous tactic crito then weigh in with scornful colourful offensive remark about how free thinkers insincerely vary their standards of intellectual conduct accord to what company they be in nasty quarrel be in the make but alciphron call halt to this irksome and needle discourse he continue for my part be friend to inquiry be will that reason should have its full and free scope build on no man authority for my part deny god doesn serve my self interest in any way any man may believe or not believe god as he please still euphranor must allow me to stare little at his conclusions the conclusions be yours as much as mine for you be lead to them by your own concessions you it seem stare to find that god be not far from every one of us and that in him we live and move and have our be act first thing this morning you think it strange that god should leave himself without witness do you now think it strange that the witness should be so full and clear must say do be aware of certain metaphysical hypothesis to the effect that we see all things in god by the union of the human soul with the intelligible substance of the deity which neither nor anyone else could make sense of this refer to thesis of malebranche for sober hard think out reason he hold that any ideas that come before our mind be literally god not ideas that he cause in us but ideas that he have himself in his mind the phrase intelligible substance of the deity be typical malebranche speak but never dream that anyone would claim that we see god with our own physical eye as plainly as we see any human person whatsoever and that he daily speak to our sense in plain and clear dialect as for that metaphysical hypothesis can make no more of it than you can but think it clear that this optical language that euphranor have be describe have necessary connection with knowledge wisdom and goodness it be equivalent to constant creation indicate an immediate act of power and providence it can be account for on mechanical principles by atoms or attractions or emanations of gas here what we have the instantaneous production and reproduction of ever so many sign combine dissolve transpose diversify and adapt to an endless variety of purpose constantly shift in ways that be suitable to the circumstances incapable of be explain by the laws of motion chance fate or any other such blind source of energy this present and testify to the immediate operation of spirit or think be wise good and provident spirit who direct and rule and govern the world some philosophers be convince of the wisdom and power of the creator from the structure and work of organic body and the orderly system of the world nevertheless think that god leave this system with all its part and content well adjust and set in motion as an artisan leave clock to run on its own for certain period but this visual language prove that there be not merely creator but care governor who be actually and intimately present to us attentive to all our interest and to all our movements watch our conduct and attend to our minutest action and design throughout the whole course of our live inform scold and direct us incessantly in most evident and perceptible manner this be truly wonderful and isn it amaze that men should be surround by such wonder without reflect on it there something divine and admirable in this language address to our eye something that may well awaken the mind and deserve its utmost attention it be learn with so little trouble it express the differences of things so clearly and aptly it instruct so quickly and clearly convey by one glance greater variety of bits of advice and clearer knowledge of things than could be have from several hours of talk and along with inform it also amuse and entertain the mind with such unique pleasure and delight it be of excellent use in give stability and permanence to human discourse in record sound and bestow life on dead languages enable us to write and read and thus to converse with men of remote age and countries and it answer so precisely to our purpose and need inform us more clearly about object whose nearness and size make them likely to do the most harm or good to our body and less exactly in proportion as their smallness or distance from us make them of less concern to us and yet men aren much impress by these strange things but they aren strange they re familiar and that why they be overlook things that rarely happen make an impression when they do whereas frequency lessen our admiration for things that may in themselves be ever so admirable so an ordinary person who isn much give to think and meditate would probably be more convince of the existence of god by one single sentence hear once in his life come down from the sky than by all the experience he have have of this visual language contrive with such exquisite skill so constantly address to his eye and so plainly declare the nearness wisdom and providence of the person who be address us but still can help wonder how men should be so little surprise or amaze by this visual faculty if it really be of such surprise and amaze nature let suppose nation of men blind from birth among whom stranger arrive the only sight man in all the country let suppose that this stranger travel with some of the natives and that he foretell that if they walk straight forward in half an hour they ll meet men or cattle or come to house that if they make right turn and then keep walk they will in few minutes be in danger of fall down precipice that by walk to the leave they will in such and such time arrive at river wood or mountain what do you think wouldn they be infinitely surprise that someone who have never be in their country before know it so much better than themselves and wouldn those predictions seem to them as inexplicable and incredible as prophecy would to minute philosopher can deny it but it seem to require intense think to be able to sort out prejudice that have be so long form to get over the vulgar error of think there be ideas that be common to both sense and thus to be able to distinguish the object of sight from those of touch these two kinds of object have if may put it this way blend together so intimately in our imagination that it extremely difficult for us to think ourselves into the precise state one of those men would be in if he be enable to see but believe it can be do and it might seem worth the trouble of little think especially to men who be specially and intensively engage in think unravel prejudice and expose mistake admit frankly that can find my way out of this maze can think myself into the frame of mind of the bear blind man who just begin to see and would be glad to be guide out of it by those who see better than do crito quote biblical passage he be remind of then servant announce that tea be ready they go inside for it and find lysicles already there be glad to have find my second say alciphron fresh man to maintain our common cause which sure lysicles will think have suffer through his absence why so have be draw into some concessions you win like let me know what they be well that there be such thing as god and that his existence be very certain bless me how do you come to entertain such wild idea well you know we claim to follow reason wherever it lead in brief have be reason into it reason you should say baffle with word bewilder by sophistry would you like to hear the reason that lead alciphron and me step by step so that we can examine whether or not it be sophistry easy about that can guess everything that can be say on that topic it will be my business to help my friend out whatever arguments draw him in will you admit the premise and deny the conclusions what if admit the conclusion what will you grant that there be god perhaps may then we be agree perhaps not lysicles you be subtle adversary don know what you be up to well the existence of god be basically an affair of little importance and man may make this concession without yield much what really matter be what sense the word god be to be give even the epicureans allow that there be gods but then they be idle gods with no concern about human affairs hobbes allow corporeal god and spinoza hold that the universe be god yet nobody doubt that these men be staunch free thinkers could wish indeed that the word god be entirely drop because in most mind it be couple with sort of superstitious awe the very root of all religion still don much mind if the name god be retain and the existence of god accept in any sense except that of mind that know everything and survey human action like some judge or magistrate with infinite care and intelligence the belief in god in this sense fill man mind with worry put him under constraints and embitter his very be but the belief in god in another sense can be free of anything much in the way of bad consequences know this be the opinion of our great diagoras who tell me he would never have take the trouble to discover demonstration that there be no god if the generally accept notion of god have be the one that some of the church father and scholastics have and what be that well diagoras have discover that once upon time the deepest and most theoretically serious theologians find that they couldn reconcile the attribute of god when take in the ordinary sense or in any know sense with human reason and how the world show itself to be so they adopt the doctrine that the word knowledge wisdom goodness and so on when apply to god must be understand in quite different sense from what they mean in ordinary language and from anything that we can form notion of or conceive this let them easily answer any objections that might be make against the attribute of god all they have to do be to deny that those attribute belong to god in this or that or any know particular sense which amount to deny that they belong to him at all and by deny the attribute of god they in effect deny his existence though they may not have be aware of that here an example suppose man be to object that future contingencies be inconsistent with god foreknowledge because certain knowledge of something that be uncertain be self contradictory the theologians be talk about have an easy answer to ready at hand namely what you say may be true with respect to knowledge take in the ordinary sense or in any sense that we can possibly form any notion of but there no inconsistency between the contingent nature of things and divine foreknowledge take to signify something of which we know nothing something that serve god in the way that what we understand by knowledge serve us the difference between these two be not one of quantity or degree of perfection they differ altogether totally in kind as light differ from sound actually they differ even more than that because light and sound be both sensations whereas knowledge in god have no sort of resemblance or agreement with any notion that man can form of knowledge the same can be say of all the other attribute which in this way can be equally reconcile with everything or with nothing any think person must see this be cut knot rather than untie them for something can be reconcile with the divine attribute when these attribute themselves be deny of god in every intelligible sense so that the very notion of god be take away and nothing be leave but the name without any mean attach to it in short the belief that there be an unknown subject of attribute that be absolutely unknown be very innocent doctrine which be why the acute diagoras who saw this be perfectly delight with this system if this could once make its way and be accept in the world diagoras say that would put an end to all natural or rational religion which be the basis of both the jewish and the christian religions for someone who come to god or go into the church of god must first believe that there be god in some intelligible sense not merely that there be something in general without any proper notion even very inadequate one of any of its qualities or attribute for this something in general could be fate or chaos or creative nature or anything else as well as it could be god and it no help to say there be something in this unknown be that be analogous to knowledge and goodness something that produce the effect that we can conceive to be produce by men without knowledge and goodness for this be still to surrender to the atheist side against the theists the dispute have never be over whether there be principle roughly something absolutely basic or primal first cause because all philosophers right back to the pre socratics have agree that there be what they haven agree about be whether these be true or false this principle be think intelligent be the order beauty and usefulness that we see in natural effect couldn be produce by anything but mind or intelligence properly so call the first cause must have have true real proper knowledge so we on the atheist side who think that all three be false will accept that all the natural effect that be vulgarly ascribe to knowledge and wisdom come from be in which there be no knowledge or wisdom properly so call at all but only something else that cause the things that men in their ignorance ascribe to what they call knowledge and wisdom and understand you may be surprise to hear man of pleasure like me philosophize in this context but there lot to be gain from conversation with able men it short cut to knowledge and save one from the drudgery of read and think so now we have grant to you that there be god in this indefinite sense what use can you make of this concession you can argue from unknown attribute you can prove that god should be love for his goodness fear for his justice or respect for his knowledge we agree that all those consequences would follow from god have goodness and the rest with those name take in intelligible sense but we deny that any consequences follow from attribute admit in no particular sense or in sense that none of us understand thus since from such an account of god nothing can be infer about conscience or worship or religion you be welcome to the account and so as not to stand out from the crowd we ll use the name god too and so snap there an end of atheism this account of deity be new to me don like it so ll leave it to be maintain by those who do it not new to me while ago hear minute philosopher triumph on this very point and that set me to inquire what basis there be for it in the church father or the scholastics crito now embark on long and learn lecture start with the early history of this idea that knowledge etc be not to be apply to god in the same sense as they be to men just how early its start be be not clear because issue arise about the true authorship of various work it be clear that the thesis wasn mean in the flatten out way in which lysicles have understand it but rather than go into all those detail we can safely jump ahead to this thomas aquinas express his sense of this matter as follow all perfections that create things get from god be also perfections of god in certain higher sense which the scholastics express by say that those perfections be in god eminently so whenever we attribute to god perfection to which we give name borrow from that perfection in create things we must exclude from the name mean everything that belong to the imperfect way in which that attribute be find in create things from this he infer that knowledge in god be not habit or disposition but pure act and although suarez join other scholastics in teach that the mind of man conceive knowledge and will to be faculties or operations of god only by analogy to create things yet he plainly declare this not quotation from him when it be say that knowledge be not properly in god this must be understand to be refer to knowledge include imperfection conceptual knowledge or some other imperfect kind of knowledge that create be have none of those imperfections in the knowledge of men or angels be feature of knowledge as such there can be knowledge that doesn have them so from the premise that god doesn have such imperfection include knowledge it doesn follow that knowledge in the proper sense of knowledge can be attribute to god and of knowledge take in general way for the clear evident understand of all truth he expressly affirm that this be in god and that this be never deny by any philosopher who believe in god at that time the scholastics generally hold that even be should be attribute to god and to create things only analogically that be they hold that god the supreme independent self cause cause and source of all be mustn be suppose to exist in the same sense of exist as that in which create be exist not that he exist less truly or properly than they do but only that he exist in more eminent and perfect manner wouldn want anyone to be lead through misunderstand of scholastics use of the term analogy and analogical to the view that we can get any distance towards form true and proper notion of attribute that we apply to god by analogy so let us look into the true sense and mean of those word everyone know that analogy be greek word use by mathematicians to signify liken of proportion for example when we observe that two be to six as three be to nine this equality of proportion be call analogy and although the word proportion strictly signify only the relation of one quantity to another in looser derive sense it have be apply to signify every other kind of relational property and the term analogy have be broaden along with proportion so that now it signify liken or equality in respect of all relations or relational properties whatsoever and so we find the scholastics tell us there be an analogy between intellect and sight because intellect be to the mind what sight be to the body and that he who govern the state be analogous to him who steer ship so that monarch be analogically call pilot be to the state what pilot be to his vessel there something else that may help to clear this matter up namely the scholastics distinction between two kinds of analogy metaphorical and proper the bible have plenty of examples of metaphorical analogy attribute human part and passions to god when he be represent as have finger an eye or an ear when he be say to repent to be angry or grieve everyone see that the analogy be merely metaphorical such things as part and passions properly understand essentially involve some imperfection so when it be say the finger of god appear in some event men of common sense mean only that the event in question be as truly ascribe to god as the work work by human finger be ascribe to man and similarly with the rest the phrase the rest be berkeley if it be mean to cover anger and grief as well as eye and ears crito doesn explain how but the case be different when wisdom and knowledge be attribute to god passions and sense as such involve defect but there no defect in knowledge as such so it be all right to attribute knowledge to god therefore in the proper formal mean of the word knowledge as long as it be attribute in way that be proportional to god infinite nature so we can say that just as god be infinitely above man so his knowledge be infinitely above man thus this doctrine of analogical perfections in god or our know god by analogy seem to be misunderstand by those who infer from it that we can form any direct or proper notion however inadequate of knowledge or wisdom as these occur in god and now gentlemen you may think should ask your pardon for have dwell so long it twice as long in the original on point of metaphysics and introduce into good company such unpolished and unfashionable writers as the scholastics but lysicles give me the open so leave him to answer for it never dream of this dry lecture if have open up the discussion to these scholarly matter by my unfortunate mention of the scholastics it be my first fault of that kind and promise it will be my last don enjoy involvement with crab author of any sort it true that occasionally one find good idea in what we call dry writers an example be the idea be speak of which must admit strike my fancy but for writers such as these we have the like of prodicus and diagoras who read obsolete book and save the rest of us that trouble so you pin your faith on them only for some odd opinions and matter of fact and critical point but could safely rely on them for more than that we know the men in whom we put our trust they be judicious and honest and have no aim except to get to the truth and sure that some author or other have maintain the view present in the same sense as diagoras report it that may be but it never be generally accept view and it never will be so long as men believe in god that be because the same arguments that there be first cause also prove that the first cause be intelligent use intelligent in its proper sense and also wise and good use those word too in their true and formal mean but for your part alciphron you have be fully convince that god be think intelligent be in the same sense as other spirit though not in the same imperfect manner or degree well do have some worry about that with knowledge you infer perhaps imply wisdom and with wisdom you infer goodness and can see that it be either wise or good to enact laws that can ever be obey do anyone find fault with the exactness of geometrical rule because no one in practice can achieve it the perfection of rule be useful even if it isn reach many can approach something that no one actually reach but how be it possible to conceive of god as so good when man be so wicked there be some plausibility perhaps to the idea that little soft shadow of evil set off the bright and luminous part of the creation and so contribute to the beauty of the whole piece here paint but you can account in that way for such large black blot as those the world have that there should be so much vice and so little virtue on earth and that the laws of god kingdom should be so poorly observe by his subject that what can be reconcile with the surpass wisdom and goodness of the supreme monarch tell me alciphron would you argue that state be ill administer or judge the manners of its citizens on the evidence of the disorder commit in the gaol or dungeon would not well for all we know this spot with its few sinners may be as small proportion of the universe of think be as dungeon be of kingdom we seem to get our view not only from revelation but also from ordinary plain sense perception which lead us to infer by analogy with the world as we see it that there be innumerable order of intelligent be happier and more perfect than man our life be very short and this earthly globe where we live be mere point in comparison with the whole system of god creation we be indeed dazzle by the glory and grandeur of some things here below because we know no better but incline to believe that if we know what it be to be an angel for one hour we would return to this world even to sit on the brightest throne in it with vastly more loathe and reluctance than we would now descend into loathsome dungeon or sepulchre to me it seem natural that such weak passionate and short sight creature as man be always liable to worry of one kind or other but as he this very same creature be also apt to be over positive in judge and over hasty in draw conclusions these difficulties and doubt about god conduct be turn into objections to his existence and so men end up argue from their own defect against the divine perfections and although the view and temperaments of men be different and often opposite you can sometimes see them deduce the same atheistic conclusion from contrary premise two minute philosophers whom know use to argue each from his own temperament against providence care god one of them bad temper and vindictive man say that he couldn believe in providence because london have not be swallow up or consume by fire from heaven the reason he give be that the streets be full of people who show no belief in god or worship of him except perpetually pray that he would damn rot sink and confound them that sentence from perpetually to the end be as berkeley write it the original like this version seem to speak of people call down god wrath on themselves the other an idle good temper fellow conclude that there can be such thing as providence because an utterly wise be would have to have better things to do than attend to the prayers and action and little interest of mankind after all if god have no passions how can it be true that vengeance be his or how can he be say to be jealous of his glory for the lord thy god be jealous god exodus in this context jealous of his glory mean resentful of anything that deny or belittle his glory we believe that god execute vengeance without revenge and be jealous without weakness just as the mind of man see without eye and grasp without hand as when we say see the flaw in your argument and grasp the situation it time to end this part of the discussion so we ll grant that there be god in this dispassionate sense but then what of it what do this have to do with religion or divine worship what be the point of all these prayers and praise and thanksgivings and psalm sing that the foolish vulgar call serve god what sense be there in all these things what use be they what be they for we worship god we praise and pray to him not because we think that he be proud of our worship or fond of our praise or prayers and affect by them as mankind be or because we think that our service can contribute in some measure to his happiness or good but because it be good for us to be dispose to relate in that way to god because our worship be just and right suitable to the nature of things and fit to the way we relate to our supreme lord and governor if it be good for us to worship god it would seem that the christian religion which claim to teach men the knowledge and worship of god be of some use and benefit to mankind doubtless unless be very much mistake you win be able to show that that be right it be now nearly dinner time let stop our conversation for now and pick it up again tomorrow morning fifth dialogue saturday dion report that on the next morning friday the group walk to charm spot in the countryside and be settle down for an all day conversation when they be interrupt by clamour include the bark of hound and the roar of country squire it be fox hunt in which one of the hunters have fall from his horse and break rib the day be spend in get him to crito home and care for him there send for surgeon feed the fox hunters who with loud rustic mirth give proof of their religion and loyalty by the healths they drink and so on the follow morning the discussion group return to the place where they have be when the hunt and accident interrupt them now lysicles be fastidiously elegant man and witty one be utterly contemptuous of the rough manners and conversation of the fox hunters and be angry that he have lose so many hours in their company cheer myself up he say by the think that there be no longer any of this species among us mean presumably move in the social circle in which move it strange that men should be entertain by such uncouth noise and hurry or find pleasure in the society of dog and horse how much more elegant the diversions of the town be fox hunters reply euphranor in certain way resemble free thinkers the fox hunters employ their animal faculties in pursuit of game and you gentlemen employ your intellectual faculties in the pursuit of truth it the same sort of pastime though the object be different would rather be compare to any brute on earth than rational brute in this context rational be code for human lysicles be say that he would rather be compare to sub human animal than to brutish human be such as fox hunter that mean that you have be less displease with my friend pythocles whom have hear compare the common sort of minute philosophers not to the hunters but to the hound he give this reason you ll often see among the dog loud babbler with bad nose lead the unskilful part of the pack who all rush after him without follow any scent of their own any more than the herd of free thinkers follow their own reason but pythocles be blunt man and he can ever have encounter such reasoners among the free thinkers as you gentlemen who can sit so long at an argument dispute every inch of grind and yet know when to make reasonable concession don know how it happen but it seem that alciphron have be make concessions for me as well as for himself speak for myself not quite so ready to concede things but don want to be stand out either truly alciphron when consider how far we have come and how far we be agree think it likely that we ll eventually come to be in complete agreement you have grant that life of virtue be to be prefer as the kind of life most conducive both to the general good of mankind and to the good of individuals and you allow that the beauty of virtue isn by itself strong enough motive to get mankind to live virtuously this lead you to agree that the belief in god would be very useful in the world and that therefore you would be dispose to accept any reasonable proof of his existence such proof have be give and you have accept it well then if we admit divinity why not divine worship and if worship why not religion to teach this worship and if some religion why not the christian one if we can find better one and christianity be already establish by the laws of our country and hand down to us from our forefathers be we to believe in god yet not pray to him for future benefit or thank him for past ones not trust in his protection or love his goodness or praise his wisdom or marvel at his power and if these things be to be do can we do them in any way that be more suitable to the dignity of god and man than the way lay down by the christian religion be not perhaps altogether sure that religion must be absolutely bad for the public but hate to see religion walk hand in hand with considerations of government and social order don like to see human right tie to religion be not in favour of any kind of govern high priest he reel off list of countries that have have such know witty free thinker he dead now who be great admirer of the ancient druids he detest the present establish religion but use to say that he would like to see the druids and their religion restore as it flourish in gaul and britain in ancient time it would be good thing he think that there should be number of thoughtful men set apart to preserve knowledge of arts and sciences to educate youth and to teach men the immortality of the soul and the moral virtues that be what the ancient druids do he say and be glad to see them once more establish among us how would you like it alciphron that priests should have power to decide all controversies settle dispute about property distribute reward and punishments that anyone who didn submit to their decree should be excommunicate regard with disgust exclude from all honour and privilege and deprive of the common benefit of the laws and that from time to time number of laymen should be cram together in wicker work idol and burn to death as an offer to their pagan gods how would you like live under such priests and such religion not at all such state of affairs would be utterly unacceptable to free thinkers but that what the druids and their religion be like if we can trust cæsar account of them now more than ever convince that there ought to be no such thing as an establish religion of any kind certainly all the nations of the world have until now be out of their wits even the athenians the wisest and freest people on earth have who know what foolish attachment to their establish church they offer it seem monetary reward to whoever would kill diagoras of melos free think contemporary who laugh at their mysteries and protagoras another of the same sort narrowly escape be put to death for write something that seem to contradict their accept notions of the gods that how our noble sect be treat in ancient athens and have no doubt that your druids would have sacrifice many holocaust berkeley word of free thinkers wouldn give farthing to exchange one religion for another away with them all together root and branch anything less than that isn worth do no druids or priests of any sort for me see no place in the world for any of them this remind me of how we end our last philosophical conversation we agree that next time we would return to the point we have then just begin on namely the use or benefit of the christian religion which alciphron challenge crito to show all the readier to take this up because don think it be hard to do one great mark of christianity truth be in my view its tendency to do good it seem to be the north star principal guide to navigation at sea that guide all our judgments about practical matter include moral ones because these be always connect with universal benefit but to think straight about this matter we should try to do what lysicles do in an earlier conversation see page take account of things as whole go as far as we possibly can in see how principles branch out into consequences in its four occurrences in this paragraph principle mean source or seed see euphranor on page we needn pay much attention to the moods or whims or imaginary distress of few idle men whose ideas may be offend though their conscience can be wound what we have to do be to consider fairly the true interest of individuals as well as of human society now as be evident to anyone who get his notion of it from the gospel the christian religion be fountain of light joy and peace source of faith hope and charity so it have to be principle of happiness and virtue you have to be blind not to see that destroy the principles of good action must destroy good action as for someone who see this and yet persist in try to destroy the principles if he isn wicked who be it seem to me that any man who can see in some depth and some breadth must be aware of his own misery sinfulness and dependence perceive that this present world be not design or adapt to make rational souls happy welcome the chance to get into better state and be overjoy to find that the road lead to that better state involve love god and man practise every virtue live reasonably while we be here on earth proportion the value we put on things to the value they actually have and use this world without misuse it that what christianity require it doesn require the cynic nastiness or the numbness of the stoic can there be higher ambition than to overcome the world or wiser ambition than to subdue ourselves or more comfortable doctrine than the forgiveness of sin or more joyful prospect than that of have our low nature renovate and assimilate to the deity our be make fellow citizens with angels and sons of god do pythagoreans or platonists or stoics ever propose to the mind of man purer mean or nobler end how much of our happiness depend on hope how totally be hope extinguish by the minute philosophy on the other hand how it be cherish and raise by the gospel let anyone who think seriously consider these things and then say which he think deserve better of mankind he who recommend christianity or he who run it down which do he think be likelier to lead happy life to be hopeful son an honest dealer worthy patriot he who sincerely believe the gospel or he who doesn believe word of it he who aim at be child of god or he who be content to be know as one of epicurus hog just look at the character and behaviour of average examples of the two sort of men and then say which sort live in way that accord best with the dictate of reason the preparer of this text ask anthony long uc berkeley for help with epicurus hog and this be part of his reply include with permission in the last verse of horace little epistle to tibullus he describe himself to his fellow poet as hog from epicurus herd in his self mock context horace say that he have be observe the epicurean rule of live care free for the day when you want to laugh you will see me sleek and fat in fine shape hog horace know that the true epicurean be not voluptuary but he ironically echo that stock prejudice it amaze to see how different things look when they be view in different light or by different eye the picture have of religion be very unlike yours crito when consider how it unman the soul fill it with absurd dream and slavish fear how it extinguish the gentle passions inspire spirit of malice and rage and persecution when see bitter resentments and unholy wrath in the very men who preach meekness and charity to others perhaps gentlemen of your sect think that religion be subject beneath their attention but it seem to me that someone who set about oppose any doctrine ought to know what he be oppose so ll tell you religion be the virtuous mean between disbelief and superstition we don defend superstitious follies or the rage of bigots what we plead for be religion against irreligion law against confusion virtue against vice the hope of christian against the despondency of an atheist win defend bitter resentments and unholy wrath in any man much less in christian and least of all in clergyman but if even the best christians sometimes produce outbursts of angry emotion that win surprise anyone who reflect on the sarcasms and rudeness with which christians be treat by the minute philosophers for as cicero remark somewhere an insult have sting that wise and good man will find it hard to bear he say it in latin but even if you sometimes see particular self profess christians go to faulty extremes of any kind through passion and weakness while unbelievers of calmer and cooler temperament sometimes behave better this contrast prove nothing in favour of disbelief or against christianity if believer act badly that be because of the man not of his belief and if an unbeliever do good that be because of the man not of his unbelief you win deny that the clergy be regard as physicians of the soul and that religion be sort of medicine that they deal in and administer well now if very many souls be diseased and lose how can we think that their the physician be skillful or that his medicine be good it common complaint that vice increase and men grow more wicked by the day if shepherd flock be diseased or unsound who be to blame but the shepherd for neglect them or not know how to cure them have nothing but contempt for such shepherd such medicine and such physicians who do what all huckster do use grave and elaborate speeches to peddle their pills to the people who be never the better for them it seem utterly reasonable to say that we should base our judgment of physician and his medicine on the medicine effect on the sick but tell me lysicles would you judge physician by the sick who take his medicine and follow his prescriptions or by those who don doubtless by those who do well then what be we to say if great number of sick people refuse to take the medicine and instead of it take poison of directly opposite nature that have be prescribe by others whose concern it be to discredit the physician and his medicine to block men from use them and to destroy their effect by drug of their own be the physician to blame for the health trouble of those people by no mean by the same line of argument doesn it follow that the tendency of religious doctrines should be judge by the effect they produce not on all who hear them but only on those who accept or believe them it seem so if we be to be fair then shouldn we judge the effect of religion by the religious of faith by believers of christianity by christians but suspect there be very few of these sincere believers still win it suffice to justify our principles if in proportion to the number who accept them and the strength of the faith with which they be accept they produce good effect there may be more such believers than you think and if there aren isn that the fault of those who make it their proclaim purpose to lessen that number and who be those but the minute philosophers say it be owe to the clergy themselves to the wickedness and corruption of clergymen and who deny that there may be minute philosophers even among the clergy in such numerous body there be bind to be men of all sort but despite the cruel reproach fling at the clergy by their enemies think that any fair mind observer of men and things will be incline to regard those reproach as reveal fault in those who fling them as much as in the clergy at whom they be fling especially if he take into account the strident tone of those who censure the clergy don know enough of the world to claim to judge the virtue merit and wide range accomplishments of men in the various professions and anyway don like the odious work of comparison but will to say this the clergy in this region where live be by no mean disgrace to it on the contrary the people seem to profit greatly from their example and doctrine but suppose the clergy to be sinners and faulty as of course all men certainly be suppose you could detect here and there among them great crimes and vices what inference can you draw against the profession itself from its unworthy practitioners any more than the pride pedantry and bad live of some philosophers create case against philosophy or those of lawyers case against law it be certainly right to judge principles from their effect but then we must know them to be effect of those principles it precisely the method have follow with respect to religion and the minute philosophy can honestly say that never know any man or family become worse in proportion as they become religious but have often observe that minute philosophy be the worst thing that can get into family the easiest way to impoverish divide and disgrace it what have observe by this same method of trace cause from their effect be that the love of truth virtue and the happiness of mankind be good stuff for speeches but they aren what drive the clergy in their work if they be why would clergymen be as they all be so fond of abuse human reason disparage natural religion and trash the philosophers and scientists not all it true that christian favour confine reason within its proper bound but so do every reasonable man if we be forbid to get involve with unprofitable question empty philosophy and science that isn really science it doesn follow that all inquiries into profitable question useful philosophy and real science be unlawful no man of good sense will make those inferences it be generally acknowledge that there be natural religion that can be discover and prove by the light of reason to those who be capable of such proof but still it have to be admit that precepts and oracles from heaven be incomparably better suit to the improvement of ordinary folk and the good of society than be the reason of philosophers that why we don find that natural or rational religion ever become the popular national religion of any country it can be deny that in all heathen countries world of fables and superstitious rites have be accept under the colour of religion but question whether they be as absurd and harmful as they be vulgarly say to have be because their respective legislators and magistrates see note on page must surely have think them useful we don deny that there be something useful in the old religions of rome and greece and some other pagan countries on the contrary we freely admit that they have some good effect on the people but these good effect come from the truths contain in those false religions the more truth religion contain therefore the more useful it be think you ll have difficulty produce any useful truth any moral precept any healthy principle or notion in any non christian system of religion or philosophy that isn include in the christian religion where it be either enforce by stronger motives or support by better authority or carry to higher point of perfection so you want us to think ourselves finer people than the ancient greeks or romans if by finer you mean better perhaps we be and if we aren it not because we have the christian religion but because too many of us don alciphron protest that crito perhaps we be be indefensible he contrast cicero and brutus with an english patriot and seneca with one of our parsons crito reply that those great men be not the minute philosophers of their time and that the best of their principles be also christian ones he add that the current stand of some of the great men of the ancient world be partly due to their undeniable personal merit partly to favourable publicity and not at all to their not be christian as for more recent time careful look show great deal of moral improvement in europe under the influence of christianity for start he say let take look at england have hear much of the glorious light of the gospel and would be glad to see some effect of it in my own dear country which be incidentally one of the most corrupt and profligate on earth despite the boast purity of our religion but you wouldn be show much confidence in your religion if you compare it only with that of the barbarous heathen from whom we be derive if you want to honour your religion have the courage to make your comparison with the most renowned heathens of antiquity it be common prejudice to despise the present and over rate remote time and things there touch of this in the judgments men make concern the ancient greeks and romans those nations certainly do produce some noble spirit and great pattern of virtue but over all they seem to me to have be much inferior in real virtue and good morals to our corrupt and profligate nation so you call it to bring dishonour to our religion wonder how you would choose to describe it when you want to do honour to the minute philosophy crito back up his statement about the greeks and romans by cite examples the treatment of slave and prisoners of war kill of unwanted children gladiators and also bacchanals and unbridle lust of every kind these don have parallel in contemporary england he say largely because of christianity alciphron reply that crito be overlook facts that don fit his view cite the inhumanity of that barbarous custom of duel crito agree that duel be bad shan make an apology for every goth that walk the streets with determine purpose to murder any man who spit in his face or call him liar he go on to say that christianity isn responsible for this and alciphron say that that irrelevant to the immediate present topic which be just comparison of contemporary england with ancient greece and rome crito accept this and return to the comparison they be make say that duel isn as bad as the common roman practice of poison that very true duel be not as general nuisance as poison and it not so low either this crime if it be crime have good chance of hold on despite the law and the gospel the clergy never preach against it because they don suffer from it personally and man of honour mustn appear to oppose the mean of vindicate honour which be what duel be you aren the first free thinker to say that the clergy be not give to preach against duel but in my view that remark itself be unfair and so be your statement about why the clergy stay away from this topic in effect half of their sermons all that be say about charity brotherly love forbearance meekness and forgive injuries be directly against this wicked custom of duel as for the claim that they never suffer from it themselves that be so far from true that one can make case for say that they suffer from it oftener than other men how can you make good on that claim the ferocity of this passage suggest that it reflect berkeley own personal experience of be bully by cowards there be two kinds of bully the fight and the tame both public nuisances the fight bully be the more dangerous animal but there be far fewer of them than of tame bully the tame bully exert his talents against clergymen which the fight bully never do the qualities of man that make him count as tame bully be natural rudeness combine with delicate sense of danger mean danger to himself you see the fashionable custom of call men to account for their behaviour challenge them to duel have not lessen the force of inbred insolence and bad manners it have merely turn that force in new direction so you can often see one of these tame bully nearly burst with offend pride and bad temper that he dare not express openly because he be afraid of be challenge to duel until parson come his way provide relief give his angry state safe outlet but to return to our topic can you deny that the ancient romans be as famous for justice and integrity as today men be for the opposite qualities you can get the character of the romans from the opinions of cicero the action of cato or few shin episodes scatter through their history what you need to consider be the prevail tenor of their live and notions and then he say the picture change and he go on to cite examples of atrocious publicly approve conduct by the romans then venture to say that if you take roman history from one end to the other and impartially compare it with our own you win find the romans to be as good as you imagine or your countrymen to be as bad on the contrary really do think that an unbiased eye will detect vein of charity and justice an effect of christian principles run through england today crito pause and alciphron speak up address himself to euphranor and me it be natural for men accord to their various upbringings and prejudice to form opposite judgments about the same things crito for instance imagine that religion have only salutary effect but if you appeal to the general experience and observation of other men you ll find that the statement tantum religio potuit suadere malorum have grow into proverb which say that religion be the root of evil it be say by lucretius and wasn generalization about religion speak of agamemnon sacrifice of his daughter to goddess in the hope of get favourable wind for his attack on troy lucretius write so greatly be religion able to persuade man to do evil not just among epicureans or other ancient heathens but among moderns speak of the christian religion think it be unreasonable to set up against the general concur opinion of the world the observation of particular person or particular set of zealots whose prejudice stick close to them and keep mix in with their judgments zealots who read draw conclusions and observe with an eye not to discover the truth but to defend their prejudice notice how nasty the tone have become this be say about crito in his presence but not address to him directly although can share alciphron view admire his skill and dexterity in argument sometimes he represent an opinion acceptance by people in general as sure sign of its be wrong but when that doesn suit his purpose he just as easily make it sure sign of truth but the fact that an irreligious proverb be use by the friends and admire author of minute philosopher doesn imply that the proverb be something generally accept still less that it be truth base on the experience and observation of mankind and this one isn truth it would be as reasonable to think that darkness be natural effect of sunshine as to think that sullen and furious passions come from the glad tide and divine precepts of the gospel the sum and substance the scope and end of christ religion be the love of god and man all other doctrines and duties whether legal or moral be subordinate to this as part of it mean to it sign of it principles arise from it motives to adhere to it or effect of it tell me now how could evil or wickedness of any kind come from such source don say that there be no evil qualities in christians or that there be no good ones in minute philosophers but do say this whatever evil there be in us our principles certainly lead to good and whatever good there may be in you it be most certain that your principles lead to evil it must be admit that christianity look handsome on the outside and many plausible things can be say in favour of the christian religion take simply as we find it in the gospel he go on to report the view of one of our great writers shaftesbury that the first christian preachers sneakily make christianity look good all love charity meekness patience and so forth until they have convert much of the world and come to have political power and then they soon change their appearance and show cruelty ambition avarice and every bad quality crito respond that this be very stupid the first christian preachers die for their faith and yet ever since this religion have appear in the world we have have eternal feud factions massacre and war the very reverse of that hymn with which it be introduce in the gospel glory be to god on high on earth peace good will towards men crito accept this add that christianity be often the pretext for these evils but insist that this doesn mean it be their cause he then say that the evils of the christian era be match and outnumber by evils in pre christian time all these evils early and late be the common product of the passions and vices of mankind which be sometimes cover with the mask of religion by wicked men who have the form of godliness without the power of it this be so obviously true that surprise that any man of sense knowledge and candour can doubt it he return to ancient rome with more examples of horrors alciphron agree that the romans have high and fierce spirit which produce very bloody catastrophes but the ancient greeks he say be civilize and gentle sort of men soften by arts and philosophy crito reply that the little state and cities of greece as alciphron call them have their factions which persecute each other with such treachery rage and malice that our factious folk be mere lamb by comparison for evidence of this he refer to thucydides history of the war between athens and sparta and he express contempt for free thinkers divers to the bottom of things fair inquirers and openers of eye who be capable of such gross mistake as sentimentalise ancient greece the rest of mankind we could more easily give up but as for the greeks men of the most refine genius express high esteem of them not only on account of the qualities that you think fit to allow them but also for their virtues on the basis of the fullest and fairest observation can make think that if virtue stand for truth justice and gratitude there be incomparably more virtue right now in england than could ever be find in ancient greece he go on about the ingratitude that some greek state show to some of their citizens who have be benefactors and then move on to this as for the source of the chief advantage of the greeks and romans and other nations that have make the greatest figure in the world incline to think it be their special reverence for the laws and institutions of their countries these inspire them with steadiness and courage and with the heartfelt and noble love of their country and what they understand to be their country be not confine by language or ethnic origin still less by geographical location their notion of their country also take in certain system of manners customs notions rites and civil and religious laws can see your drift you want us to revere the laws and religious institutions of our country well excuse us if we don see fit to imitate the greeks or to be govern by any authority whatsoever sure you don if islam be establish by law don doubt that the free thinkers the very ones who applaud turkish maxims and manners so loudly that you think they be ready to turn turkish would be the first to protest against them but to return to our topic agree that there always have be war and factions in the world and that there always will be on some pretext or other as long as men be men but there specifically christian sort of war and sort of warrior one that the heathens have no notion of the noun divine have be replace by theologian in this version but its occurrence in this paragraph and the next be leave unaltered for reason that you ll see talk about dispute in theology the war and polemical divine the warriors which the world have be amazingly pester with if you take their word for it they be teach peace meekness harmony and whatnot but even cursory look at how they behave show them to have be all through the centuries the most contentious quarrelsome disagree crew that ever appear on earth the skill and trickery the zeal and eagerness with which the scholastic divine those barbarians split hairs and quarrel over non existent imagine things be more absurd and greater scandal to human reason than all the ambitious intrigue plot and politics of the court of ancient rome and make me even angrier than those do if divine be quarrelsome it not because they be divine but because they be undivine and unchristian justice be good thing and so be the art of heal yet men can be wrong in the administer of justice or poison in the give of medicine but just as wrong can be justice or an effect of justice and poison can be medicine or an effect of medicine so also pride or strife can be religion or an effect of religion have say that agree that you can often see hot head bigots sign up with religious party as well as political ones without be of credit or service to either for the next bite you need to remember that the scholastics be roman catholic philosophical theologians while berkeley be an anglican as for the scholastics in particular don think the christian religion have any need to defend them their doctrines or their method of handle them still however futile their view may be and however clumsy their language it simply not true that they sneer and scold and rant in their write and they be so far from show fury or passion that an impartial judge might rate them far ahead of the minute philosophers in keep close to the point and in their tone and good manners but anyway if men be puzzle tangle with one another talk nonsense and quarrel about religion they do the same about law medicine politics and everything else that matter it not just in divinity that men run into dispute trickery nonsense and contradictions it also happen in the other professions have mention and indeed in any pursuit where men have create abstract theory but this doesn stop there be many excellent rule sound ideas and useful truths in all those professions in all dispute human emotions too often get stir into the mix in proportion as the subject be think to be more or less important but we oughtn to confuse the cause of man with the cause of god or make human follies an objection to divine truths it easy to distinguish what look like wisdom from above from what come from the passion and weakness of men the distinction be so obvious that when someone doesn draw it one might be tempt to think that this be result not of ignorance but of something worse the hostile tone isn improve the conduct we cite in objections to minute philosophers be natural consequence of their principles anything they can cite in objections to us be an effect not of our principles but of human passion and frailty oh terrific so we must no longer cite in objections against christians the absurd contentions of councils the cruelty of inquisitions the ambition and power grab of churchmen you can cite them as objections against christians but not against christianity if the divine author of our religion and his disciples have sow good seed and if together with this good seed the enemies of his gospel include the minute philosophers of all age have sow bad seed from which weed and thistles grow isn it obvious that these bad weed can be blame on the good seed or on those who sow it he develop this point at considerable and not very interest length alciphron respond by shift to different complaint the triviality and unimportance of much theological write shan undertake to vindicate theological write as such general defence of them would be as needle as general accusation be groundless but let them speak for themselves and don condemn them on the word of minute philosopher anyway let look at the worst case imagine quarrelsome pedant in divinity who dispute and ruminate and write on some refine point that be as useless and unintelligible as you please but then ask yourself what would have become of this man if he have be bring up to be layman rather than cleric mightn he have employ himself in shifty business deal harass law suit factions seditions and such like amusements do much more harm to the public than he actually do with his useless theological study the two page between here and occupy five page in the original they aren of much philosophical interest alciphron complain that in theological dispute what men lack in light they commonly make up in heat crito reply that in any branch of study when some isolate point be be look into with great care that tend to generate an inflate sense of its importance but this be routine stuff and not special to theology alciphron complain that trivial theological squabble be regard as learn and the public take an interest in them as though they be sport events he object to theological write on stylistic ground what man of sense or breed would not detest the infection of long wind pulpit eloquence or of that dry formal pedantic stiff and clumsy style that smell of the lamp and the college those who be foolish enough to admire the universities as centre of learn must think that my reproach smell of the college be strange one but it be perfectly fair these days the ablest men agree that the universities be merely hot bed of prejudice corruption barbarism and pedantry speak for myself find no fault with universities all know be that have three hundred pound year to spend in one of them and it be the happiest time of my life as for their book and style of write didn have time to pay any attention to them whoever want to pull weed will never lack work there no shortage of bad book on every subject don know what theological write alciphron and his friends be familiar with but venture to say that our english theologians include many writers who for breadth of learn solidity of content strength of argument and purity of style be not inferior to any writers in our language as for our universities which be of course imperfect any impartial observer will find that with all their flaw they be better than universities in other countries and much better than the mean picture that minute philosophers draw of them it natural that the loudest complaints against place of education come from those who have profit least by them crito mistake the point be rely on the authority not of dunce or rake or an absurd parent examples that crito have use but of the most accomplish critic this age have produce this great man characterize men of the church and universities with the finest touch and most masterly pencil what do you think he call them what why the black tribe magicians formalists pedants beard boys and after have sufficiently deride and explode them and their mean and crude learn he provide the most admirable model of good write namely his own write they have to be acknowledge as the finest things in our language as could easily convince you for also have with me something by that noble writer after an exchange about noble writer who be also nobleman in fact shaftesbury alciphron take book from his pocket and start to read long flowery unclear passage in which idleness be praise as be better than busy greed it be quote verbatim from shaftesbury book characteristics of etc except that berkeley mischievously put it on the page as fifty line blank verse of which this be typical but here busy form solicit us active industrious watchful and despise pain and labour she wear the serious countenance of virtue but with feature of anxiety and disquiet what be she mutter what look she on with such admiration and astonishment and so on until euphranor interrupt with protest why should we interrupt our discussion to read play it isn play or poetry alciphron reply but famous modern critic moralize in prose he go on about this great man discoveries and his write euphranor comment sarcastically on the kind of man who offer to reform the style and taste of the age and alciphron not hear the sarcasm continue enthusiastically about the admire critic of our time who have among other things argue that shakespeare milton and others have be greatly over rat euphranor ask what effect this great man have have on the public do they aspire to his sublimity or imitate his chaste unaffected style alciphron still naively enthusiastic say that the taste of the age be much mend crito get in slap at the write style of minute philosophers and then shift the conversation back towards where it be few minutes ago when your great man tell us that ignorance and ill taste be due to the christian religion or the clergy can just take his word for it the truth be the opposite of that crito say in speech that be sum up in this everyone who know anything know that we be indebted for our learn to the greek and latin tongue and that we be indebted for those tongue to our religion what else could have make foreign and dead languages in such demand among us alciphron speak harshly of one sort of learn that be undoubtedly of christian origin and special to the universities he deplore the years that young people waste in acquire the mysterious jargon of scholasticism and the further years they have to spend be unteach it by the world but what if this scholastic learn be not of christian but of moslem origin be derive from the arabs and what if this complaint about gentlemen spend several years in learn and unlearn this jargon be just sham and this be say sarcastically specimen of the truth and candour of certain minute philosophers surely it wouldn be such deplorable loss of time if young gentleman spend few months on the much despise and decry art of logic surplus of logic be by no mean the prevail nuisance of this age it be one thing to waste one time learn and unlearn the barbarous term ultra fine distinctions and long wind sophistry of the scholastics it another to attain some exactness in define and argue things that may be not altogether beneath the dignity even of minute philosopher logic use to be regard as its own object self sufficient subject all on its own so that the art of reason instead of be transfer to things be aim only at word and abstractions which produce sort of leprosy in all branch of knowledge but those time be past and logic once cultivate as the chief branch of knowledge be now consider in another light it doesn play anything like the part in the study of young gentlemen at the universities that be attribute to it by those admirable reformers of religion and learn the minute philosophers crito go on to say that the restoration of arts and civilize learn have be due to the influence of christians whom he name at length in the course of this he speak of the great scholars who flourish on the other side of the alps in the golden age as the italians call it of pope leo the tenth and alciphron challenge this say that the noble critic from whom he quote few minutes ago regard the italians as corrupters of true learn and erudition crito reply with some slight remark about the noble critic and surprisingly lysicles back him up say in effect that someone who write so much about art and taste and critical skill oughtn to write as badly as that man shaftesbury do in the course of some further skirmish between alciphron and crito about whether and to what extent english culture be indebted to church or universities or ancient languages crito speak of christianity as generator of arts and sciences and also of the general sense of virtue and humanity and the belief in providence and after life which all the argumentation of minute philosophers have not yet be able to abolish that remark bring the topic of christianity and culture to an end because alciphron reply it be strange that you still persist in argue as though all the gentlemen of our sect be enemies to virtue and downright atheists when have assure you that on the contrary we have among us number of people who announce their support for virtue and natural religion and have also assure you that myself now argue on that basis how can you claim to support natural religion and yet be open enemies of christianity which be the only establish religion that include whatever be excellent in natural religion and which be the only mean of make those precepts duties and notions become reverence throughout the world suppose someone try to persuade people that he be greatly in support of particular earthly monarch that he love and admire his government while at the same time he take every opportunity to express himself as most bitter enemy of the very persons and methods that contribute most to the monarch service and to make his dignity know and revere his laws observe or his dominion extend wouldn such person be think weak or insincere and isn this just what minute philosophers like you do announce themselves as advocate of god and religion and yet do all they can to discredit christians and their worship admittedly you argue against christianity in one way that doesn necessarily express hostility to religion as such namely by represent christianity as the cause of evil and wickedness in the world but that line of argument could be use with equal force against civil government food and drink every faculty and profession learn eloquence and even against human reason itself and even those of your sect who allow themselves to be call deists if their view be thoroughly examine will be find to include little religion in them as for god providence watch over our conduct and dispense bless or hardships the immortality of the soul the last judgment and an after life with reward and punishments those be great point of natural religion but how few if any of your free thinkers have try to get men to have serious sense of them how many go the opposite way try to make the belief in them shaky or ridiculous when man declare principles and personal beliefs be utterly subversive of the things list above anything he say about virtue piety and religion will be understand as merely play safe and not be conspicuous frankly have never have any like for religion of any kind reveal or unrevealed what unrevealed be natural religion and venture to say the same for any gentlemen of our sect that be acquaint with have never know any of them do anything as low as use the word god with reverence or express respect for piety or for any sort of worship he add detail about ways in which minute philosopher may talk as though he have respect for christianity explain that this be never to be take seriously and literally then after all these arguments and ideas that beget one another without end here be my view in nutshell my friends and can for the life of us see why man mightn do very well and govern himself without any religion at all brutes do it and they be think to be less capable than men you say that brutes have instincts sense appetites and passions to steer and conduct them well men have all those and also have reason that they can consult when they need to from these premise my friends and conclude the road of human life be well enough light without religion brutes don have much power of think and it be confine to particular things that be present to the animal so they be sufficiently restrain and keep in order by the force or faculties of other animals and by the skill of man and conscience and religion don come into this in contrast with that human reason be faculty of vast extent and power especially power to do mischief and conscience be necessary balance to it and another point by the law of their nature non human animals be push to one particular end or manner of existence without inclination or mean either to deviate from that or to go beyond it but man have in him will and higher principle through which he can pursue different or even contrary end and he can fall short of or exceed the perfection natural to his species in this world just as he can either hand over control to his sensual appetites thereby degrade himself into the condition of brutes or else well order and improve his mind thereby upgrade himself into something resemble an angel man be the only animal with enough understand to know his god what the use of this knowledge if it isn to ennoble man to raise him to level where he be more like god and more in touch with god and what would the good of such ennoblement be if it end with this life and how can these things happen without religion but we have already discuss at great length the topics of vice and virtue man and beast sense and intellect lysicles surely you don want us to go back to where we be three or four days ago by no mean would much rather go forward and make an end as soon as possible but to save us all trouble let me tell you once for all that whatever you say you ll never persuade me that so many able and agreeable men be in the wrong and pack of snarl sour bigots in the right lysicles don look for religion among bigots or for reason among libertines each kind disgrace their respective position the bigot exert an angry zeal for things that hardly matter and the libertine pay no attention to even the plainest and most important truths and surely whatever there be that silly narrow and uncharitable in the bigot the same be in great measure to be attribute to the conceited ignorance and petulant irreligion of the libertine lysicles ignore this and round on alciphron have always think he say that nothing could be sillier than to think of destroy christianity by praise natural religion you can consistently think well of one and poorly of the other because it obvious that natural religion need the help of reveal religion if it be ever to be establish and accept anywhere except in the brain of few idle speculative men know what your concessions would come to anyone with half an eye can see that the belief in god virtue an after life and such fine notions be the very basis and corner stone of the christian religion give them this foundation to build on and you ll soon see what superstructures our theologians will raise from it admit the truth and importance of those doctrines and you don have to be conjurer to prove from that the excellence and usefulness of the christian religion and then of course there must be priests to teach and propagate this useful religion and if there be priests provision will have to make for their maintenance enable them to perform all their rites and ceremonies in decent fashion and to keep their sacred character respect and the plain upshot of all this be that the monarch will ally himself with the priesthood in order to subdue the people so we have open the gate to long procession of ecclesiastical evils priestcraft hierarchy inquisition we have lose our liberty and property the nation have be put to vast expense simply to purchase bridle for our mouth and saddle for our back he say this with some sharpness of tone and scold manner alciphron be upset but say nothing and show confusion in his look crito look at euphranor and me with smile then look over at the two philosophers he say if you ll allow me to intervene to prevent rupture between old friends and brethren in opinion would remark that in what lysicles have just say there be something right and something wrong it seem right to assert as he do that real belief in natural religion will lead man to approve of reveal religion but it be wrong to say that inquisitions tyranny and ruin must follow from this your free thinkers no offence mean seem to mistake where their strength lie they imagine strongly but reason weakly they be mighty in exaggeration but thin in argument isn there some way to relieve them from the terror of that fierce and bloody animal an english parson win it be enough to trim his talons without chop off his finger then they be such wonderful defenders of liberty and property he tell an anti pope story to illustrate his thesis that we may see every day both things and notions be attribute to liberty and property that in fact don have and aren mean to have anything to do with either of them really be it impossible for man to be christian without be slave or to be clergyman without have the principles of an inquisitor be far from shield and justify the greed for domination or tyrannical power in ecclesiastics some who have be guilty of that have pay dearly for it and it be to be hop they always will but once we have calm the fury and folly of the ambitious bishop isn it time to look see whether some evil mightn come to the state from different source the overflow zeal of an independent whig believer in primitive christianity who be oppose to the establish church of england ll tell you this without bother to prove it the worst tyranny this nation ever felt be from the hand of patriots of that kind don know tyranny be harsh word and be sometimes misapply when spirit men with independent view create ferment or make change in the state those who lose by the change be apt to consider things in one light and those who win to consider them in another in the mean time this be certainly good policy we should be spar with our money and keep it for better use than to spend on the church and religion what follow be longish discussion of property right the legal basis for the ownership of land by the church and so on then can never hope crito to make you think that my scheme be reasonable you and each argue correctly on our own principles and we ll never agree until we drop our principles and that can be do by reason we all talk of just and right and wrong and public good and so on we use the same name but our notions and conclusions be very different perhaps diametrically opposite and yet the conclusions on each side may admit of clear proof and be infer by the same method of reason for instance the members of club belong to define man as sociable animal and so we don count as men the human creatures of whom it can be say that we prefer their absence to their presence by this standard it clear that men of pleasure good humour men and men of wit be the only human creatures who properly and truly count as men therefore whatever be conducive to good incomes for them be for the good of mankind and consequently very just and lawful even though it seem to bring loss or harm to other creatures say seem because no real harm can be do in respect of life or property to those who don know how to enjoy life and property we hold this on the basis of clear and well connect reason but others may view things in another light give different definitions draw different conclusions and perhaps regard as wart or tumour of human nature what we think to be the top and flower of the creation from all which there must arise very different system of morals politics right and notions lysicles then swing into jokey classification of men that someone invent in which kinds of men at give the name of kinds of animals thus accord to this system the fish be the men who swim in pleasure the beasts be dry drudge covetous rapacious folk and all those addict to trouble and business like oxen and other dry land animals which spend their live in labour and fatigue the bird be airy notional men enthusiasts projectors poets philosophers and such like if you ask me which species of mankind like best answer the fly fish man of animal enjoyment with mixture of whim thus you see we have our creeds and our systems just as more solemn folk do with this difference that our systems be not strait lace not strap on tightly but sit easy to be slip off or on as the mood take us or the occasion serve and now can listen with the greatest equanimity imaginable to my opinions be argue against or refute wish all men be like that but you ll find sort of men needn name the sort that can endure have their opinions examine or their fault criticize they be against reason because reason be against them we free thinkers be all for liberty of conscience if our tenets be absurd we allow them to be freely argue against and inspect and by parity of reason we might hope to be allow the same privilege regard the opinions of other men alciphron war that can stand the light be indeed suspect so whatever move you to make this complaint promise you that never will up to now have allow your reason its full scope and ll always do so in the future but for the love of truth be candid and don spend your strength and our time on matter that aren significant or be irrelevant to our topic or have be agree between us we allow that tyranny and slavery be bad things but why should we fear them from the clergy at this time we agree that rites and ceremonies aren of central importance in religion but why should we ridicule things that in their own nature be not bad and may be good and that bear the stamp of supreme authority freely admit that men in theology as well as other subject get tangle in useless dispute and will probably go on do so till the end of the world but why must all the human weakness and mistake of clergymen be attribute to wicked design why indiscriminately abuse their character and their beliefs be this like candour love of truth and free think grant bad temper and ill breed can occasionally be find in the clergy but aren the same fault find in english laymen who have spend their live in seclude rural environment grant that there endless futility in the work of the scholastics but deny that volume of that do as much harm as page of minute philosophy that weak or wicked men should by favour of the world creep into power and high position in the church there nothing surprise in that and it be natural to suppose that once they be in those position they will behave like themselves but through all this it be obvious that what drive them in their unworthy achievements be not the gospel but the world not the spirit but the flesh not god but the devil we don shrink from agree that nothing be more infamous than vice and ignorance in clergyman nothing lower than hypocrite more trivial than pedant more cruel than an inquisitor but you should agree in your turn gentlemen that nothing be more ridiculous and absurd than for pedantic ignorant and corrupt men to throw the first stone at every shadow of their own defect and vices in other men when think about the detestable state of slavery and superstition feel my heart swell to take in the utter bless of independent liberty this be the sacred and high privilege the very life and health of our english constitution so you mustn be surprise if we with vigilant and search eye guard it against the minutest appearance of evil you must even allow us to cut around it go deep and use magnify glass so as better to see and extirpate every least speck that appear in the freedom that we be careful to preserve and angry to see threaten as for unrestricted liberty leave that to savage who think be the only ones who have it but as for the reasonable legal liberty of our constitution most heartily and sincerely wish it may to survive and flourish among us for ever he say that any amount of vigilance be justify if it stop attempt to change our free and gentle government into slavish or severe one but how he demand can one get out of this any basis for an attack on religion there follow an discussion of right of suppression alciphron report magistrate who be so hard press by free thinkers that he couldn find anything to say in defence of his religion except that if ten million people inhabit the same island want to have laws establish religion in certain ways and ten thousand able men publicly sneer at those laws the ten million would be entitle to expel the ten thousand out of the island and what answer would you make to this remark of the magistrate the answer be obvious by the law of nature which be superior to any human institutions intelligence and knowledge have right to command folly and ignorance say that able men have by natural right dominion over fool this doctrine however be never thoroughly understand until quite recently after conversation about hard press individual magistrate alciphron will now revert to use the magistrate in the manner describe in note on page as kind of short hand for the law make and law enforce authorities of the country generation back hobbes and his followers though otherwise very great men declare in favour of the religion of the magistrate probably because they be afraid of the magistrate but time have change and the magistrate may now be afraid of us crito briefly comment on this and then launch into an anecdote that start brief and inconclusive discussion of the legal requirement that only profess christians could serve on juries then this much be certain the christian reform religion be principal part and corner stone of our free constitution and really think it be the only thing that make us deserve freedom and make us able to enjoy it freedom be either bless or curse depend on how men use it if our religion be wipe out among us and the ideas that be regard by free thinkers as prejudice of christian education be erase from the mind of britons it seem to me that the best thing that could then happen would be the loss of our freedom people who have such restless ambition such strength of feel such enmity between factions so much at stake in contest such unrestricted licence of speech and press amid so much wealth and luxury the only thing that have so far keep them from ruin be the hoary old wive tales he use latin phrase quote persius as on page that you claim to be wipe out under the christian religion this nation have be greatly improve from be sort of savage we have become civilize polish and learn we have make decent and noble figure both at home and abroad and as our religion decrease be afraid we shall be find to have decline so why should we persist in that dangerous experiment one would think crito that you have forget the many calamities cause by churchmen and religion and one would think that you have forget what we say this very day in answer to that objection don want to go on for ever say the same things so ll make just three point if we reflect on the past state of the christian world and especially of our country with our feud and factions that exist while we all have the same religion the war of the roses so violent and bloody and long we may well suspect that the nastiness that have more recently show up under the mask of religion would have break out under some other pretext if religion hadn be available it doesn follow from anything you can say about our history that the evils accidentally arise from religion bear any proportion to the good effect it have really produce or to the evils it have prevent the best things can accidentally give rise to evil and such an accidental effect be not strictly speak produce by the good thing itself but by some evil thing not part property or effect of it that happen to coincide with it think we have give enough discussion to the topic of today session must acknowledge that there something in what crito have say about the usefulness of the christian religion lysicles may not like this but owe it to my status as fair impartial adversary to say this ll even admit that some of our sect be in favour of tolerate christianity remember meet of number of able men where after much debate we pass three resolutions the first be that no religion ought to be tolerate in the state but this on more mature think be judge impracticable the second be that all religions should be tolerate but none look on with favour except atheism but it be fear that this might make trouble among the lower sort of people the third resolution be that some religion or other should be establish for the use of the vulgar after long dispute about which religion this should be it be propose that the present religion might be tolerate until better one be find but while grant that christianity be expedient can never think it true while there be unanswerable objections to it be it all right if present those at our next meet to which we all agree sixth dialogue monday in the original work this be by considerable margin the longest of the dialogues but not in this version from which much of the philosophically uninteresting material have be cut dion report that on the sunday the various people spend the day in their characteristic ways then the next morning we assemble at the same place as on saturday and when we be all seat remark that during the precede week our discussion have be longer and less interrupt than have ever know in town where men hours be break by visit business and amusements so much so that anyone who settle for form his ideas wholly from conversation must end up with ideas that be very shatter and incomplete and what have we achieve reply alciphron through all these continue discussions for my part think that with regard to the main point that divide us the truth of the christian religion just where be at the outset answer that so many point have be examine discuss and agree between him and his adversaries that hop to see them eventually agree on everything for in the first place say the principles and opinions of those who be call free thinkers or minute philosophers have be pretty clearly explain it have be also agree that vice isn beneficial to the nation in the way that some men imagine it be that virtue be highly useful to mankind but that the beauty of virtue be not enough on its own to get men to be virtuous that therefore the belief in god and providence ought to be encourage in the state and tolerate in good company as useful notion and it have be prove that there be god that it be reasonable to worship him and that the worship faith and principles prescribe by the christian religion be good influence alciphron reply be address to even if everything that dion have just say be true he say that doesn move me an inch from where be at the outset regard the main point that because nothing in all this prove the truth of the christian religion though each of the detail dion have list might create prejudice in its favour so must be on my guard against be prejudice person prejudice in favour of christianity as lover of truth must look sharp and consider carefully every step take you may remember alciphron that you suggest as today topic certain difficulties and objections that you have to offer against the christian religion we be now ready to hear and consider anything of that kind that you think fit to produce atheism and the wrong idea of christianity as something harmful to mankind be great prejudice and man lose them may make him more apt to argue with candour and submit to reasonable proof but lose prejudice against an opinion as you have do isn the same as acquire prejudice in its favour as you fear you may have do so we have reason to hope that you ll be able to do justice to your cause without be uncritically in love with it after self congratulatory open alciphron say that he will do his best to share with those who be wander lower down in the narrow dark paths of error the view of things that he have achieve from his lofty stand above the reach of prejudice then know then that each of the various group of men have faith and religious system that sprout from the common grain of enthusiasm that they all have grain that be basic ingredient in the mix of human nature each group tell of communication with the invisible world revelations from heaven divine oracles and the like when consider all these claim with an impartial eye can possibly assent to them all and find within myself something that restrain me from assent to any of them will to go where be lead by common sense and the light of nature but the same reason that tell me to yield to rational proof forbid me to accept opinions without proof this hold in general against all revelations all let this be count as my first objection against the christian religion in particular this objection presuppose that there no proof or reason for believe the christian revelation so if good reason can be assign for such belief the objection come to nothing now presume you ll agree that true and proper reason for believe report be the authority of the person who make it and the better his authority the sounder the claim his report have to our assent well now the authority of god be on all account the best so it be most reasonable to believe anything that come from god mean anything that be tell to us by god agree but then you have to prove that it do come from god and aren miracles and the fulfilment of prophecies join with the excellence of its doctrine sufficient proof that the christian religion come from god miracles would indeed prove something but what proof have we of these miracles proof of the same kind that we do have the only kind we can have of events that occur long ago and far away we have authentic account pass down to us from eye witness whom we can conceive to have be tempt to deceive us by any human motive whatsoever why can we because in give these account they be act contrary to their interest their prejudice and the very principles in which they have be nurse and bring up these account be confirm by the unparalleled raze of the city of jerusalem and the scatter of the jewish nation which be an endure testimony to the truth of the gospel particularly of the predictions of our bless saviour for example and when ye shall see jerusalem compass with armies then know that the desolation thereof be nigh luke within less than century these account be spread throughout the world and believe by great number of people they be also write down translate into numerous languages and hand down with the same respect and consent of christians in the most distant church don you see say alciphron star straight at crito that all this depend on tradition and tradition believe me give only weak hold it be chain whose first link may be stronger than steel and yet the last ones weak as wax and brittle as glass imagine picture copy successively by hundred painters each copy from the one before how like the original will the last copy be how lively and clear will an image be after hundred reflections between two parallel mirror that how like and lively think faint vanish tradition will be at the end of sixteen or seventeen centuries some men have false heart others wrong head and even when heart and head be both good memory may be treacherous something get add something omit something vary from the truth and the cumulative result of many such additions deductions and alterations through the centuries the bottom line be quite different from what the tradition start with we can know ancient facts by oral tradition or write tradition and write tradition may be either private keep in the hand of particular men or public record in public archive now as far as can see all these three sort of tradition agree in attest to the genuine antiquity of the gospels and they be strengthen by supplementary evidence from rites institute festivals observe and build church baptistries and sepulchres put up by ancient christians grant that your objection hold against oral tradition on its own can think it be so difficult to transcribe faithfully and once something have be put in write it be secure against slip of memory and can with reasonable care be preserve intact for as long as the manuscript last which we know from experience can be more than thousand years tradition of more than sixteen hundred years need only two or three link in its chain he give an example and despite the great length of time those link may be very sound and unbroken and no reasonable man will deny that an ancient manuscript may be as credible now as when it be first write we have it on good authority and anyway it seem probable that the first christians be careful to transcribe copy of the gospels and epistles for their private use and that other copy be preserve as public record in many church throughout the world and that portion of them be constantly read in their assemblies what more could be say to prove the authenticity of the write of classic author or ancient record of any kind alciphron turn to euphranor and say silence an adversary be different from convince him don you agree euphranor oh yes they be different but what want be to be convince it not so clear to me that you do look however will man be to be convince he can be convince by probable arguments when there be demonstration go the other way agree that he can well it be as obvious as demonstration can make it that no divine faith can possibly be build on tradition take the case of an honest credulous farmer who be drill and lecture every sunday by his parish priest clearly it the parson he believe in not god all he know about revelations doctrines and miracles be what the priest tell him he believe all this and his faith be purely human if you say he have the liturgy and the bible as foundation for his faith the difficulty still recur as regard the liturgy he pin his faith on the civil magistrate as well as the ecclesiastic one and neither of those can claim divine inspiration as for the bible he take both that and his prayer book on trust from the printer who he believe make true editions from true copy so faith be at work here but faith in what faith in the priest in the magistrate in the printer editor transcriber none of whom can possibly be claim to be divine have the hint for this argument from cratylus it an arrow out of his quiver sharp one let me get hold of this arrow and try it out for myself suppose that your farmer hear magistrate declare the law from the bench or suppose he read it in statute book do you think that the magistrate or the printer be the true and proper object of his faith and submission or do you acknowledge higher authority on which their official action be base again if you read passage in the roman historian tacitus that you believe to be true would you say you assent to it on the authority of the printer or transcriber rather than the historian maybe maybe not don think oblige to answer these question all you be do be to transfer the question from one subject to another what we be discuss be not law or non religious history but religious tradition and divine faith can see well enough which way you be head but ll never accept that you can solve one difficulty by start up another alciphron you expect others to stay fair and stand firm as you choose to express it on page while you pluck out their prejudice but you elude our grasp at every turn how can euphranor argue with you if not from your concessions and how can he know what they be unless you tell him my question admit of only two answer take your pick from one of the answer it will follow that by parity of reason we can easily conceive how man can have divine faith without ever feel inspiration or see miracle that be because it be equally possible for mind to which divine revelation have come by some channel oral or scriptural to carry its think and submission back up that channel to the source end up with faith not in human but in divine authority its proper and true object be not the mechanisms and agents of the channel but rather the great origin itself from the other answer it will follow that you re introduce general scepticism into human knowledge and smash the hinge on which civil government and all the affairs of the world turn in short you ll destroy human faith in order to get rid of divine leave it to you to consider how well this go with your announcement that you want to be convince really would be glad to be convince one way or other to come to some conclusion but have so many objections in store that you shouldn attach much weight to your deal with one of them depend on it you ll find me behave like gentleman and lover of truth ll state my objections briefly and plainly and accept reasonable answer as fast as you can give them come on euphranor make the best case you can for your tradition you can never present as constant and universal tradition one that be admit to have be unknown or at best dispute in the church for several centuries and this be the case with the new testament for though we now have settle canon mean that the church hierarchy eventually decide which book should be include in the new testament and which should not everyone must see and admit that tradition can grow stronger by age and that anything that be uncertain in the earliest christian time can be undoubted later on what do you say to this euphranor like to get clearer about your mean before give an answer this objection of yours seem to presuppose that tradition that have be constant and undisputed may be admit as proof but that where the tradition be defective the proof must be so too be this your mean it be so the gospels and the epistles of st paul which be universally accept from the start and have never since be doubt of by the church must be accept as genuine and since these book contain all those point that be in controversy between you and me don need to argue with you about the authority of other book of the new testament that didn come to be generally know and accept in the church until later someone who assent to the undisputed book be no longer an unbeliever even if he doesn regard the book of revelation or the epistles of st jam or st jude or st peter or the last two epistles of st john as deserve to be in the canon the additional authority of these portion of the bible may carry weight in particular controversies between christians but it can add anything to arguments against an unbeliever as such when you be christian it will be time enough to argue about the status of those book and you ll be nearer to be christian if your way there be shorten by the omission of that question for the present not as near as you may think despite all the fair and plausible things you may say about tradition when consider the spirit of forgery that reign in primitive time and reflect on the many gospels act and epistles that be attribute to the apostles and then come to be recognize as spurious confess that can help suspect the whole bible tell me alciphron do you suspect that all plato write be spurious because the dialogue on death be agree to be so win you accept any of cicero write as genuine because sigonius pass off book that he have write as cicero de consolatione and the deception succeed for some time suppose admit as genuine the work of cicero and plato that be commonly accept as genuine what then why then would want to know whether it balance and impartial in free thinker to measure the credibility non religious and sacred book by different standards let us know what we christians be allow to work with when we argue with minute philosophers be we allow the benefit of common maxims in logic and criticism if so then please give reason why write which in the style and manner and matter bear visible sign of be fraudulent and have accordingly be reject by the church can be use as an argument against write that have be universally accept and hand down by unanimous constant tradition don know of anything truly valuable that hasn be counterfeit so your argument have universal scope but something that tell against everything doesn hold against anything it would seem as silly to reject the genuine write of non religious author because of the fake as it would be unreasonable to suppose that the heretics and the many sects of christians wouldn have include anyone capable of that kind of deceit see no way of judge this at such great distance of time it be all dark and doubtful mere guess work crito intervene with list of the reason there be to trust the judgments of the church councils about what be spurious and what genuine alciphron then move to new point the bible be not well enough write to have be divinely inspire euphranor say that that not decisive even an earthly monarch leave the detail word of his laws and proclamations to his secretaries and clerk to express his sense in their own word also some roughness of style match the roughness we find in large scale nature for example there be never really straight shore line though we do find geometrically exact shape in the work of insects so it seem that scrupulous attention to what men call the rule of art be not observe in the big productions of the author of nature alciphron reply that that all right as regard niceties of grammar and expression but he still count it against the divine inspiration idea that so much of the bible be write in flat characterless bore way euphranor explode alciphron if dare to follow my own judgment would be apt to think there be noble beauties in the style of the bible in the narrative part simple and unaffected manner in the devotional and prophetic part an animate and sublime style and in the doctrinal part such an air of dignity and authority as seem to declare that their origin be divine but shan set up my judgment on such delicate matter against that of the wits and men of genius who be so plentiful in your sect nor be tempt to do so because it seem to me that this latest argument of yours be worthless anyway something isn show not be the oracle of god by be deliver in plain dress rather than in the entice word of man wisdom this may perhaps work as defence of some simplicity and carelessness in write but what defence can there be for nonsense crude nonsense could easily give many examples because once read the bible the whole way through look for them look at the th psalm in this bible that have here the author begin very grandly call on all the inhabitants of the earth to listen and assure them that his mouth will speak of wisdom and the meditation of his heart will be of understand but he have no sooner finish this preface than he put this senseless question wherefore should fear in the days of evil when the wickedness of my heel shall compass me about the wickedness of my heel what nonsense after such solemn introduction have naturally weak eye and many things that can see be clearly see by others so don conclude that thing be absolutely invisible because can see it well it may be with my understand the way it be with my eye so don venture to declare thing to be nonsense because don understand it he then go through several interpretations that have be suggest for the passage treat it as some kind of metaphor or as involve hebrew idiom that we don have in english crito chime in with bore anecdotes about foreigners who have be mislead by english idioms then euphranor resume in this very psalm that you have pick on should have think that the good sense and morality contain in what follow the obscure bite would make fair mind reader judge favorably concern the original sense of the author in the part that he couldn understand tell me alciphron when you be read the classics and encounter something that you can make sense of do you immediately conclude that it be nonsense by no mean we have to expect difficulties to arise from different idioms old customs hint and allusions that may be clear at one time or place and obscure at another then why win you judge passages of the bible by the same rule the source of obscurity that you mention be all common both to religious and non religious write and there no doubt that in both sort of write the difficulties would vanish if we have more detail knowledge of the languages and circumstances he give an example phrase in the book of jeremiah that look odd unless one know certain things about life near the river jordan here and there difficult passage may be clear up but there be many that can be explain away by any exercise of human skill or ingenuity what do you say you about the discoveries that some of our learn writers have make of false citations from the old testament find in the new testament some new testament citations of passages in the old testament aren exactly accurate this have be know for centuries by christian writers it isn new discovery by minute philosophers it can be explain by errors of transcription and be of no great importance he develop this reply at some length conclude what can you infer from all this except that the design of the bible be not to give us exact knowledge of every detail and that the holy spirit didn dictate every particle and syllable and miraculously preserve them from even the slightest alteration alciphron renew his attack on the bible style and euphranor renew his defence then it wouldn be problem for me to admit that popular incorrect style might serve the general end of revelation as well as more precise and exact one but can get over the obscurity if the supreme be have speak to man it seem to me he would have speak clearly and the word of god wouldn need commentaries see note on page you seem to think that obscurity be defect but if it turn out not to be one that will be the end of this objection of yours ii now speech and style be instrumental in the convey of thoughts and notions in get knowledge opinion and assent iii and the perfection of an instrument should be measure by the use for which it be intend iv so something that be defect in one instrument may be no defect in another for instance edge tool be in general design to cut but because the use of an axe and razor be different it not defect in an axe that it isn as sharp as razor or in the razor that it isn as strong and heavy as an axe so we can say in general that any instrument be perfect if it suit the purpose or intention of the person who use it vi from which it seem to follow that no man speech be defective in clearness if it isn intelligible to all men but be intelligible enough to the ones the speaker intend should understand it or if it isn equally clear in all part or doesn convey perfect knowledge all through but do convey an imperfect hint which be all the speaker intend vii so we need to know the intention of the speaker if we be to know whether his style be obscure through defect or design viii but no one man can possibly know all the end and purpose of god revelations so for all you know to the contrary the obscurity of some part of the bible may fit quite well with purpose that you don know in which case they aren evidence that the bible doesn come from god the book of the bible be write in ancient languages at distant time on various occasion and on very different subject doesn that make it reasonable to think that some part or passages might have be clearly enough understand by those for whose use they be principally design and yet seem obscure to us who speak another language and live at another time be it at all absurd or unsuitable to our ideas of god and man to suppose that god may reveal but be reserve about how much he reveal on certain remote and sublime subject content to give us hint and glimpse rather than clear view may we not also suppose as something reasonable and suggest by the analogy of nature that some point that could have be more clearly explain be leave obscure merely to encourage our diligence and modesty two virtues which if it wouldn seem disrespectful to such great men would recommend to the minute philosophers lysicles reply this indeed be excellent you expect that men of sense and spirit should in great humility put out their eye and blindly swallow all the absurdities and nonsense that be offer to them as divine revelation on the contrary want them to open their eye look sharply and try the spirit berkeley phrase to see whether it be of god rather than passively and ignorantly condemn all religions together if they would compare the christian system with other claimants to divine revelation consider impartially the doctrines precepts and events contain in christianity weigh them in the balance against any other religious natural moral or historical account and examine diligently all the proof internal and external that for so many age have be able to influence and persuade so many wise learn and inquire men they might find in christianity certain special feature that sufficiently distinguish it from all other religions and suppose revelations as basis for reasonable faith if that happen leave it to the minute philosophers to consider whether they be right to take revelation so distinguish and attest and dismiss it with impatient scorn because some part of it be obscure he return to the topic of obscurity in texts write in an ancient foreign language the likelihood that we win know all the idioms and so on and repeat his plea for judge religious write in the same manner as non religious ones you may lecture and expound but nothing you have say or can say alter the fact that revelation that doesn reveal be mere contradiction in term tell me alciphron don you accept that the light of the sun be the most glorious production of providence in this natural world suppose do well this light that you can deny be make by god shin only on the surface of things doesn shine in the night shin imperfectly in the twilight be often interrupt refract and obscure represent distant things and small things dubiously imperfectly or not at all isn all this true it be doesn it follow that to expect in this world constant uniform light from god without any mixture of shade or mystery would be to depart from the rule and analogy of the creation and that therefore it wrong to argue that the light of revelation be not divine because it not as so clear and full as you expect or because it doesn shine equally at all time and in all place because claim to be fair and unbiased in this debate have to admit that you say some plausible things as man of argument will always be able to do in vindication of his prejudice but should come into the open and tell you once for all that however much you question and answer illustrate and enlarge you win convince me that the christian religion be divinely reveal in support of this attitude have say several things and have many more to say that carry weight not only with myself but with many great men who be good friends of mine and they win stop carry weight no matter what euphranor say on the other side envy you the happiness of know such people can have that advantage live as do in this out of theway place so have to make the most of this opportunity that you and lysicles have put into my hand regard you as two able physicians and you be please to consider me as patient whom you have generously undertake to cure now patient must be completely free to explain his case and report all his symptoms because conceal symptom might prevent perfect cure so please understand me not as object to or argue against either your skill or your medicine but only as report on my condition and on the effect your medicine have on me alciphron didn you give me to understand that you would wipe out my prejudice it be true good physician eradicate every fibre of the disease come you shall have patient hear tell me didn plato believe that god inspire particular men as organs or trumpet to proclaim and sound forth his oracles to the world and wasn the same opinion also embrace by other great writers of antiquity socrates seem to have think that all true poets speak by inspiration and cicero hold that there be no extraordinary genius without it what would you infer from this would infer that inspiration shouldn seem impossible or absurd but rather agreeable to the light of reason and the notions of mankind you ll agree with this suppose because you have make it an objection against one particular revelation that there be so many claim to revelation throughout the world alciphron reply with dig at the word inspire it come he rightly say from latin mean to breathe or blow in so it should be apply to mere wind or vapour and not to big truths euphranor sharply take this up point out that alciphron be will to say that he discourse while sit down and yet discourse come from latin mean run about alciphron defend his use of discourse in the obvious way and euphranor cash in on that may we not as well conceive that the term inspiration might be borrow from sensible things to stand for god action when in an extraordinary manner he influence arouse and enlighten the mind of prophet or an apostle let drop the silly point about blow in and get back to our real topic when we look into our own mind it seem to me we plainly perceive certain instincts impulses and tendencies that from time to time spring up unaccountably in our souls this be ordinary and natural but why can we conceive it possible for the human mind for an extraordinary reason to be move in an extraordinary manner have its faculties stir up and kick into action by supernatural power he admit that there have be and will be wild visions and morbid rave but that doesn mean that there aren also genuine inspirations we can rule out the possibility that true prophet or inspire person can distinguish divine inspiration from mentally unbalance imagination as easily as we can distinguish sleep from wake he quote the book of jeremiah to that effect see no need to deny that inspirations and revelations be possible make the best you can of this concession well if something be allow as possible we be entitle to suppose that it be fact we be let us then suppose that god choose to make revelation to men and that he inspire some men as mean to instruct others have suppose this can you deny that their inspire discourse and revelations might have be commit to write or that the write versions might in the course of time become obscure in many place that some of them might even have be less clear than others at the outset or that they might get alter by frequent transcribe as other write be know to have do isn it even very probable that all these things would happen grant it well then how can you defend your claim that the bible be not divine because of facts about it that you now acknowledge would probably accompany any divine revelation transmit down to us through so many centuries he concede the point about small blemish that might arise from copy errors etc but defy the wit of man to invent anything more extravagant than the account the bible give of apparitions devil miracles god manifest in the flesh be bear again grace self denial resurrection of the dead and such like sick dream things so odd unaccountable and remote from human understand that you have no more chance of clear them of the charge of absurdity than you have of make black man white by wash him no critical skill can justify them no tradition can recommend them even as inventions of competent men let alone as divine revelations always have great opinion of your wisdom alciphron but now consider you as something more than man how otherwise could you know what it may be proper for god to reveal this be of course sneer don think it be insult to the greatest of human understand to suppose that they be ignorant of many things that aren suit to their faculties or lie out of their reach even the plan of princes often lie beyond the ken of their subject who can only know what be reveal to them by those at the helm and be often unqualified to judge concern the usefulness and likely consequences even of what they be allow to know until in due course the scheme unfold and be explain by the course of events of course many things contain in the bible be remote from the common understand of mankind but don see that it follow from this that they didn come from divine revelation on the contrary doesn it seem reasonable to suppose that revelation from god would contain something different in kind or more excellent in degree than anything that lie within the grasp of humans even of the wisest philosopher account of separate spirit good or bad prophecies miracles etc be undoubtedly strange but don see how you can prove them to be impossible or absurd some things be so evidently absurd that it would be almost as silly to disprove them as to believe them and take these the ones list moment ago to be of that sort isn it possible that some men show as much prejudice and narrowness in reject all such account as others might show slackness and credulity in accept them can understand why anyone who admit the union of the soul with the body should declare it impossible for the human nature to be unite to the divine in some way that can be describe or grasp by reason nor can see any absurdity in the idea that sinful man may be bear again may become new creature by the grace of god reclaim him from carnal life to spiritual life of virtue and holiness and since be govern by sense and appetite be contrary to the happiness and perfection of rational creature don in the least wonder that we be tell to exercise self denial as for the resurrection of the dead don regard that as so very contrary to the analogy of nature when see plant that have be leave to rot in the earth rise up again with new life and vigour or worm that appear to be dead change its nature so that something that at first crawl on the earth become new species and fly around with wing and when consider that the soul and body be things of such utterly different kinds can see any reason to be positive that the soul must necessarily be extinguish when the body fall to piece especially since find in myself strong natural desire for immortality and haven observe that natural appetites be give in vain give merely to be frustrate you regard certain things as extravagant and absurd but shan agree with that until see good reason for it no alciphron your positive air mustn be regard as proof and we win think things be contrary to common sense just because you say so by common sense we ought to mean either the general sense of mankind or the improve reason of think men now believe that all those article you have so powerfully and vividly sum up and explode can be show to be consistent with and even in harmony with common sense in one or other of these sense that the gods might appear and converse among men and that the divinity might inhabit human nature be things that the heathens believe and though the notion of devil may not be so obvious or so fully describe there be plain trace of it in several traditions he cite ancient greeks chaldeans and egyptians and report that text as early as homer contain something that cardinal bessarion have identify as an allusion to the fall of satan then many more classical reference in connection with the other article on alciphron list apparently with grace uppermost though it isn mention by name wind up any man who really think have only to look at what other think men have think men who can be suppose to be prejudice in favour of reveal religion and he ll see cause if not to think with reverence of the christian doctrines of grace self denial rebirth sanctification and the rest at least to judge more modestly and cautiously than someone who confidently declare them absurd and in conflict with the reason of mankind lysicles say that none of this have the slightest appeal him and that if this make anyone think he be ignorant be happy and safe in my ignorance crito say perhaps not so safe which he and back up thus mere ignorance isn crime but willful ignorance deliberate ignorance ignorance from laziness or conceited ignorance be fault we have the testimony of heathen writers as proof of that and it doesn need proof to show that if ignorance be fault then we can be secure in ignorance as an excuse honest crito seem to hint that man should take care to inform himself while alive so that his neglect to do so win be punish when he be dead the best way to get gentleman to keep on with something be to try to frighten him out of it this be the stale and absurd tactic that priests use make them and their religion more odious and contemptible to me than all the other items put together that hell and eternal punishment thing be the most absurd as well as the nastiest think that ever enter into the head of mortal man but you must admit that it isn an exclusively christian absurdity because socrates that great free thinker of athens think it probable that impious men be punish for ever in hell it be report of this same socrates that he be often know to think for twenty four hours at stretch fix in the same position and wrap up in meditation our modern free thinkers be men of more lively sort those old philosophers be most of them insecure think they have narrow timid way of think that fall far short of the frank spirit of our time but if man doesn know the nature of the soul how can reason give him any assurance about whether it be mortal or immortal but what if do know the nature of the soul have be teach that whole secret by modern free thinker man of science who discover the nature of the soul not by tiresome look into himself or by get himself confuse in labyrinth of notions or by stupidly think for whole days and nights together but by look into things and observe the analogy of nature this great man be try and test scientist who have conduct many experiment on plant he hold that men and plant be really of the same species that animals be move plant and plant be fix animals that the mouth of animals have the same use as the root of plant that blossom and flower correspond to the private part of the human body that plant and animal body be both organic and both have life which be certain motion and circulation of juices through the appropriate tube or vessels the soul he say be the specific form or source from which come the distinct qualities or properties of things we start with plant because they be simpler than animals and thus easier to analyse the soul of any plant rosemary for example be nothing more or less than its essential oil this be the source of its special fragrance taste and medicinal virtues its life and operations use chemical techniques to separate or extract this essential oil and you get the soul of the plant what leave behind be dead carcass that doesn have single property or power of the plant this essential oil be an oily substance with fine subtle element or volatile salt imprison in it strictly speak this volatile salt be the essence of the plant soul contain all its power and the oil be the vehicle of this most subtle part of the soul the part that fix and individuate it and just as the plant die when separate from this oil so the soul die when this essential oil be split up into its elements as you can see by leave it expose for some time to the open air so that the volatile salt or spirit can fly off after which the oil remain dead and tasteless not perceptibly weigh any less but have lose that volatile essence of the soul that ethereal aura that spark of existence which return and mix with the solar light the universal soul of the world and the only source of life talk about all life of plant lower animals and think animals which differ only accord to the fineness of organization of their body this chemical system let you at once into the nature of the soul and account for all its phenomena in the compound that be call man the soul or essential oil be what commonly go by the name of animal spirit see note on page for chemists do now agree that animal spirit be nothing but the more subtle oil now in proportion as the essential oil of the plant we call man be more subtle than that of other plant the volatile salt that impregnate it be more free to act and that explain the properties and action of humans that distinguish them from lower creatures he give some examples lysicles your ingenious friend have open up new scene and explain the most obscure and difficult point in the clearest and easiest manner this account of things strike my fancy must admit no great lover of creeds or systems but when notion be reasonable and base on experience know how to value it really seriously lysicles do you believe this account to be true in the next exchange the artist and his art mean roughly the expert and the field in which he be an expert really seriously don know whether do or not but can assure you that the ingenious artist himself hasn the least doubt about it and believe an artist in his art be sound bite of advice and short way to knowledge but what do the soul of man have to do with the chemical art the same reason that tell me to trust skillful artist in his art incline me to suspect him when he be out of his art men be too apt to reduce unknown things to the standard of what they know and bring prejudice or slant from things they have be familiar with in make judgments about things with which they have not be familiar have know violinist solemnly teach that the soul be harmony geometrician very positive that the soul must be extend and physician who have pickle half dozen embryos and dissect few rat and frog become very sure of himself and affirm that there be no soul at all lysicles decline to argue say in effect there the theory take it or leave it which euphranor ironically describe as say like gentleman then he ask whether the maxim about believe an artist in his art apply to clergymen lysicles say no why not because he lysicles know as much about religious matter as the clergy do all men of good sense be competent judge of those matter what be god attribute and his treatment of mankind the true end and happiness of rational creatures and the mean of improve and perfect their be be these more easy and obvious matter than the ones to which ordinary secular study be devote perhaps not but do know this some things be so obviously absurd that no authority will make me give in to them for instance if all mankind try to convince me that the son of god be bear on earth in poor family be spat upon beat and crucify live like beggar and die like thief wouldn believe word of it common sense show everyone how an earthly prince or ambassador can decently appear and the son of god come as an ambassador from heaven must make an appearance that be much greater than that and be in all respect the very reverse of that which jesus christ be report even by his own historians to have make do you think lysicles that if man enter london in rich suit of clothe with hundred gild coach and thousand lace footmen this would be more divine and truly grand appearance than if he have power with word to heal all kinds of diseases to raise the dead to life and calm storm at sea oh sure it be very agreeable to common sense to suppose that he could restore others to life but couldn save his own you tell us of course that he rise again from the dead but what be the point of his die in the first place the just die for the unjust the son of god die for wicked men and why precisely there why exactly then why didn he appear earlier and preach in all part of the world so that the benefit be spread wider and more evenly account for all these point and reconcile them if you can to the common notions and plain sense of mankind crito reply with two point one be that some of lysicles question be boorish and ill mannered benevolent act aren usually scrutinize as carefully as other act who but minute philosopher would on gratuitous distribution of favour ask why now rather than earlier lysicles should face the fact that he be out of his depth none of us know nearly enough to be entitle to form judgments on what it would have be reasonable for god to do there be several page of this you can judge the part of machine without know how the whole thing work lysicles say that some things can be see at first glance to be so cruel and unjust that they be obviously unworthy of god to which crito reply that we should take into account à propos of how badly god treat the egyptians how badly the egyptians have treat the israelites and also repeat that caution in judgment be appropriate when we know that we don have all the facts euphranor have argument make the point that children often don understand and may even resent action by their parent that be entirely for their own good he liken this to lysicles attitude to action by god the topic of the ancients versus the free think moderns come up again in the course of it alciphron say that the present time gray and hoary with age and experience have manifest advantage over those that be falsely call ancient the point be that in ancient time the world be younger than it be now he continue tell you in plain english euphranor we don want your revelations for this plain reason those that be clear be already know to everyone and no one get any benefit from those that be obscure just as it impossible for anyone to believe the practical principles of the christian religion and not be the better for them so it be obvious that those principles may be much more easily teach as article of faith than demonstrate or discover as doctrines of science here high grade theoretical knowledge we see all the time that many be instruct in matter of faith few be teach by scientific demonstration and fewer still can discover truth for themselves wish that minute philosophers would reflect on some facts relate to the natural or civil concern of the world with religion not come into it namely how rarely men be sway or govern by mere reason and how often by faith how little they know and how much they believe how uncommon it be to meet with man who argue soundly who really be master of reason or walk by that rule how much better qualify men be to judge concern facts than concern reason to receive truth on testimony than to deduce it from principles how general spirit of trust or reliance run through the whole system of life and opinion and at the same time how seldom the dry light of unprejudiced nature be follow or to be find if our think men would only give think to these things they might find it hard to produce good reason why faith which have so great share in everything else should have no place in religion re dry light see note on page he then reply to the be already know to everyone part of what alciphron have just say by say that obviously they weren perhaps they could have be know but revelation be useful if it reveal something that men haven take the trouble to know even if they could have know it alciphron then move to complaint against prophecies namely that they be very obscure euphranor reply that some be obscure while some be not which be pretty much what should be expect give the way the world be and the way men be alciphron in reply refer to the scepticism about prophecies of free think experts on these matter and euphranor respond to that somewhat sneeringly and remark that the christians have their experts too after further exchange of insult euphranor offer some explanations of why certain prophecies be unclear to us at this time look back in time we can see certain progress from darker to lighter in religious matter so we can reasonably expect that future events will clear up such point as at present exercise the faith of believers alciphron now drop prophecies and turn to something else want now to examine your religion by compare the system of revelation with collateral account of ancient heathen writers and show how much it clash with them the christian revelation presuppose the jewish religion so if the jewish one be destroy the christian one must of course fall to the grind with it be go to go the short way by attack this jewish revelation head on tell me if we believe the mosaic account of things the first five book of the old testament don we have to hold that the world be create not quite six thousand years ago yes we do what will you say now if other ancient record carry the history of the world back many thousand years beyond this period what if the egyptians and chinese have account extend to thirty or forty thousand years what if the egyptians have observe twelve hundred eclipse during the space of forty eight thousand years what if the chinese have also many observations antecedent to the jewish account of the creation what if the chaldeans have be observe the star for more than four hundred thousand years and what shall we say if we have successions of kings and their reign mark for several thousand years before the begin of the world assign by moses shall we reject the account and record of all other nations the most famous ancient and learn in the world and preserve blind reverence for moses the legislator of the jews if they deserve to be reject euphranor reply why shouldn we reject them this introduce an attack on the account and record that alciphron have mention the only reliable ones don go as far back as moses time for the begin of the world the writers of the record that stretch further back be unknown or unregarded by ancient astronomers modern scholars have uncover inconsistencies in the chinese account alciphron remark that the modern scholars in question be mostly roman catholic missionaries and euphranor reply that they be our only source of information about the chinese and that in any case it make sense to trust them the same persons who tell us of these account refute them if we reject their authority in one case what right have we to build upon it in another alciphron praise the chinese generally as learn able and acute people who be addict to arts and sciences euphranor reply at length that on the contrary the chinese be superstitious credulous and absurd then he turn to the egyptian record purport to make the world older than moses do and get alciphron to admit that he doesn know where those record be find when they be write how they be preserve and so on they aren mention by any ancient greek writers though some of them visit egypt euphranor comment again at even greater length on the credulity of any modern person like alciphron who believe such stuff alciphron reply with challenge how can you account for the work that the great joseph scaliger and sir john marsham have put in on those record euphranor decline to account for it and deplore the fact that such substantial scholars as scaliger and marsham should waste time on that rubbishy stuff after all it hard to see why those egyptian priests should have set up spurious record support such great claim to antiquity record that differ one from another but be alike in one thing namely that they overthrow moses history how can this be account for if there be no real foundation for the record what pleasure profit or power could motivate men to forge successions of ancient name and periods of time for age before the world begin really alciphron be there anything so strange or unprecedented in this empty wish to extend the antiquity of nations beyond the truth hasn it be see in most part of the world doesn it appear even in our own time especially among dependent and subdue people who have little else to boast of he then launch into mass of detail first about the irish and then about the sicilians these be dependent and subdue people who invent long histories for themselves as way of feel important then why isn it likely that the egyptians subdue people invent fabulous account from the same motive and like others value themselves because of extravagant claim to antiquity when in all other respect they be so much inferior to their master and it be no less certain that the phœnicians assyrians and chaldeans be each conquer and reduce people before the rest of the world appear to have hear anything of their claim to such remote antiquity but what need be there to work at account for the motivations of fabulous writers isn it sufficient to see that they relate absurdities aren support by any independent evidence seem not to have be believe even by their own countrymen and be inconsistent one with another there nothing strange in the fact that men should have the stupidity to create false account so as to deceive the world what be strange be the fact that after so many learn critics have do so much towards undeceive the world there should still be men who be capable of be take in by the paltry scrap of fabulous or counterfeit writers let me point out that those learn critics may prove to be clergymen perhaps some of them roman catholics what about sir isaac newton be he either catholic or clergyman you may not grant that he be as wise and intellectually powerful as the great men of the minute philosophy but it you can deny that he have read and think great deal on this subject end his inquiry with perfect contempt for all those celebrate rival to moses it have be observe by able men that sir isaac newton though layman be deeply prejudice as we can from his great regard for the bible and the same hold for mr locke mr boyle lord bacon and other famous laymen who however knowledgeable on some matter can be think to have achieve the keen discernment that be the special distinction of your sect but perhaps there be reason other than prejudice to incline man to give moses the preference the government manners and religion of his country be base on the truth of his history there be clear trace of that history in the most ancient book and traditions of the gentiles particularly of the brahmins and parse his account of the great flood be confirm by sign in nature as well as by write of antiquity his history be confirm by the relatively recent invention of arts and sciences the gradual people of the world the very name of ancient nations and even by the authority and arguments of that renowned philosopher lucretius who be so much admire and follow by the free thinkers when he write on other subject the continual decrease of fluids the sink of hill and the slow of planetary motion provide natural evidence that this world have begin just as the civil or historical proof that have mention plainly indicate that this begin occur at about the time assign to it in the bible and after all that let me add one more remark people dig into the earth have find quantities of shell and in some place bone and horn of animals complete and unbroken that have probably lie there for thousands of years that make it seem probable that gems medals and metal or stone implement might have remain bury complete and unbroken for forty or fifty thousand years if the world have be that old so how do it come about that no such remain be find no remnants of all those centuries precede the biblical account of time no fragment of build no public monuments no intaglios cameos statues reliefs medals inscriptions utensils or manufacture things of any kind be ever discover to testify to the existence of those mighty empires those successions of monarchs heroes and demi gods for so many thousand years let us look forward in time and think about time twenty thousand years into the future with the intervene time have involve plague famines war and earthquakes all of which will have make great havoc in the world isn it highly probable that pillars vases and statues that now exist would still exist at that future time and testify to our time and all the time between now and then think of pillars etc make of granite porphyry or jasper stone that be so hard that we know them to have last for two thousand years above grind without any considerable alteration isn it also probable that some of our current coin might be dig up at that time far in the future or that old wall and the foundations of build might show themselves just as the shell and stone of the primeval world be preserve down to our time these be matter that anyone can form judgment about use common sense and ordinary experience they give us good reason to conclude that the world be create at about the time record in the bible alciphron sit muse and make no answer whereupon lysicles speak up hark back to crito remark that lucretius support the mosaic date of the start of the world must admit that would rather suppose with lucretius that the world be make by chance and that men grow out of the earth like pumpkins than pin my faith on those wretched fable spin fragment of oriental history that alciphron have use as evidence against moses date of the start of that world as for the learn men who have take pain to clarify them and piece them together they strike me as be no better than so many musty pedants an able free thinker may now and then make some use of their laborious output and play off one absurdity against another an egyptian absurdity against jewish one but don infer from this that he have any real respect for the authority of such apocryphal writers or believe one syllable of the chinese babylonian or egyptian traditions if we seem to give them preference over the bible that only because they be not establish by law this be my plain sense of the matter and dare say it the general sense of our sect they be too rational to take such trifle seriously though they sometimes give hint of deep learn and put on grave face just to have fun at the expense of bigots since lysicles will have it so be content not to build on account of time precede the mosaic he then talk about historians of about moses own time they should be regard as on par with moses he say and some of them give account that utterly clash with his one that say that the jews be really egyptians who have leprosy and be drive out of the country for that reason on this account the religion that they say have be give to them on mount sinai be really something which they as egyptians bring with them from egypt crito reply that those other account aren evidence against the mosaic one because they be in such conflict with one another and that linguistic considerations show that the jews weren egyptians and that religion whose fundamental principle be monotheism and whose principal design be to abolish idolatry couldn have come from egypt the most idolatrous of all nations after some more of this alciphron deplore the loss of the book of those great men celsus porphyry and julian book that would have enable the modern free thinkers to demolish the whole jewish religious system at once crito question that and say some slight things about each of the three especially emphasize how credulous they be accept all sort of weird beliefs they be he conclude whimsical superstitious weak and visionary and he throw in final gibe against the impartial gentlemen who admire the talents and be proud to tread in the footsteps of those three men see things in different light something that one person wonder at be regard as negligible by another it can even happen that prejudice mind whose attention be turn towards things fault and blemish fancy it see some shadow of defect in the great light that have in our own days enlighten the world but tell me crito what you think of the jewish historian josephus he be agree to have be man of learn and judgment he do himself accept reveal religion namely judaism and christians commonly cite him with respect when his authority suit their purpose all this accept then mustn it seem suspicious to any impartial inquirer that this learn jew should write the history of his own country focus on the very place and time of jesus christ appearance without say anything about the character miracles and doctrine of that extraordinary person some ancient christians be so sensitive about this that they try to repair the situation by insert famous passage in the work of that historian forgery that have be sufficiently detect by able modern critics well there be expert opinion on both side of that question but don want to get into all that so be content to take it your way by suppose that the passage be not genuine but be the pious fraud of some wrong head christian who couldn tolerate the omission in josephus but that fraud can make the omission real objection against christianity and can see in the omission any other basis for amazement or suspicion suppose the gospel account to have exactly true it would seem very natural for josephus not to have report it give that he be aim by his work to give his country some stand in the eye of the world which have be greatly prejudice against the jews and know little of their history purpose that the life and death of our saviour wouldn have contribute to even slightly josephus couldn have be an eye witness of our saviour or his miracles he be high class pharisee who be learn in foreign as well as jewish scholarship with high position in the state whereas the gospel be preach to the poor the gospel be initially accept and then spread by poor illiterate people choose for this role so that the gospels spread wouldn seem to be the work of man or product of human self interest or power the jews generally expect the messiah to be worldly and conquer prince prejudice that be so strong that they prefer attribute our saviour miracles to the devil to acknowledge him to be the messiah at josephus time the jewish state be in condition of hellish disorder and confusion with men mind fill and stun by unparalleled war dissensions massacre and seditions of that devote people take all these facts together don find it strange that such man who be write with that view at that time and in those circumstances should omit to describe our bless saviour life and death or to mention his miracles or to pay any attention to the state of the christian church which at that time be like tiny seed just begin to take root and germinate and this will seem even less strange if you bear in mind that the apostles in few years after our saviour death leave jerusalem set about convert non jews and be disperse throughout the world the convert in jerusalem be not only some of the poorest people but be also few in number the three thousand convert add to the church in one day when peter preach in jerusalem seem to have be strangers from all over the country who have gather there to celebrate the feast of pentecost throughout the time of josephus and for several years more during succession of fifteen bishops the christians at jerusalem conform to the laws of moses which make them in outward appearance just like the rest of the jews which must have make them harder to notice the gospel when first propagate seem to ignore the great or considerable men of this world would it be surprise if they in turn overlook it as something not suit to their way of think he go on to say that learn jews at that time might well be afraid in one way of write in favour of christianity and in another way of write against it so that their safest course be to say nothing about it also the historian gamaliel do mention jesus christ in pass in his account of st jam death although he show respect for the apostle he mention jesus in casual and neutral way say nothing either good or bad about him but he characterize him as jesus who be call the christ not who claim to be the christ or who be falsely call the christ but simply and then he say it again this time in greek he continue it be evident that josephus know there be such man as jesus and that he be say to be the christ and yet he condemn neither him nor his followers which see as evidence in their favour if josephus have know or be convince that jesus be an impostor of course he would have say so plainly can understand why any man should conclude against the truth of the gospel from josephus omit to speak of it any more than from his omit to accept it if the first christians be chief priests and rulers or men of science and learn it might have be more plausible to contend that their religion be human construct than it be in fact give that it have please god to use weak things to confound the strong yet it seem an odd argument in support of any doctrine that it be preach by simple people to simple people it would indeed be very weak argument if the only testimony to the doctrine come from simple people but what we have here be doctrine of which this be true its first instrument be people with very few human advantage it make its first progress among people who didn have wealth skills or power to grace or encourage it in short time through its own innate excellence and the mighty force of miracles and the demonstration of the holy spirit it spread throughout the world and subdue men of all rank and condition of life do this not only with no support from all worldly motives but positively against such motives isn it very unreasonable to reject or suspect such doctrine on the ground that its human mean be lowly mightn this with much better reason be think to be evidence that the doctrine come from god alciphron reply that real inquirers will demand testimony from learn men there have be plenty of that but their testimony be suspect because they be prejudice christians and therefore their testimony be to be suspect you be demand evidence of the truth of christianity from people who didn believe it this isn reasonable they kick this topic around for while and then dispute start up concern how much respect the early church father deserve alciphron say that even if he do give weight to early christian write the great number of forgeries and heresies that spring up in those time would considerably take away from that weight let us suppose something that you do agree to be possible namely that there be god devil and revelation from heaven that be commit to write many centuries ago on the basis of that supposition take look at human nature and ask what would probably follow if the supposition be fact isn it very likely there would be half believers mistake bigots holy frauds men who be ambitious self interest dispute conceited schismatic heretical absurd among those who announce themselves as believers in this reveal religion and isn it also very likely that after few centuries there would be various read omissions transpositions and obscurities in the text of the sacred oracles you be the judge be it reasonable to treat as an objection to something course of events that would probably and naturally follow if the thing in question do exist well say what you will this variety of opinions must shake the faith of reasonable man where there be so many different opinions on the same point it very certain that they can all be true but it certain that they can all be false and the mean we have to use to find out the truth when man of sense embark on this inquiry he find himself suddenly startle and throw off balance by hard word and knotty question this make him abandon the pursuit think the game not worth the chase crito reply that differences of opinion and the formation of sects occur in all branch of human study he cite law medicine and politics and this doesn deter us from think that there be good rule sound ideas and useful truths in all those discipline he develop this approach in connection with medicine remark that real discoveries have be make despite the hard word and knotty question that have arise on the way to them then after brief exchange of insult crito turn to the question of schisms and sub sects but to return what profession of men be there who never split into schisms and never talk nonsense isn it obvious that out of all the kinds of knowledge on which the human mind be employ there grow certain excrescences that can safely be par off as we pare our finger nail under all that rubbishy stuff it be certain that the faith derive from christ and his apostles be not piece of empty sophistry and to claim to demolish the foundation of faith for the sake of the superstructure that humans have build be sign of poor think and it sign of unfairness to suppose that doubtful sense be fix and argue from one side of the question in dispute point such question as should the begin of genesis be understand in literal or an allegorical sense be the book of job history or parable be dispute amongst christians so an unbeliever have no right to argue from one side of any of them what we be argue for now be not this or that tenet of sect this or that controversial idea but rather the general faith teach by christ and his apostles and preserve by universal and perpetual tradition in all the church down to our own time to attack this divine doctrine on account of things that come not from within the doctrine but from external source such as the theories and dispute of men strike me as an absurdity comparable with cut down fine tree that provide fruit and shade because its leave give nourishment to caterpillars or because spiders sometimes weave cobwebs among the branch after an exchange focus on the question of how clever men ought to spend their time but after all the examination and inquiry that mortal man can make about reveal religion it be impossible to reach any rational sure foot we be tell strange things that be say to be prove by the fact that men have lay down their live for them but it be perfectly conceivable indeed it have often happen that men have die for the sake of false beliefs that they use to hold you may indeed find examples of men die for falsehoods that they believe but can you find case of man die for the sake of proposition that he didn believe of course not it be inconceivable yet this must be what happen if the witness of christ miracles and resurrection be impostors there be indeed great deal of glittery talk about faith base on miracles but when examine this matter thoroughly and track the christian faith back to its origins find that it be really base on darkness and hesitation and uncertainty instead of proposition that be evident or at least agreeable to human reason find an astonish narrative of the son of god tempt in the wilderness by the devil something utterly unexplainable have absolutely no purpose or use or reason meet with strange stories of angels appear voice from heaven demons things quite out of line with common sense and common experience along with number of incredible feats say to have be do by divine power but more probably the inventions of men and not make less likely to be so by my complete inability to guess why they be invent deeply lay plan be dark and the less we know the more we suspect but even if all those stories be true shan accept that they be miraculous until have thorough knowledge of ordinary natural cause and of the force of magic it seem to me alciphron that what you be analyse be not faith but infidelity lack of faith and that you be trace it back to its source which judge from your own account understand to be dark and doubtful worry and surmise hastiness in judge and narrowness in think and all this be base on your fantastic over rat of your own scrap of experience and on real ignorance of the view of god and of the qualities operations and inter relations of the many fundamentally different kinds of be that exist in the universe or that you don know don exist that what the source of unbelief be like obscure uncertain fanciful and conjectural whereas the source of faith be proposition that seem to me plain and clear there be nothing unclear about these this faith in christ be spread throughout the world soon after his death that wasn bring about by human learn politics or power in the church early years many knowledgeable and honest men accept this faith not from some but against all worldly motives the nearer those men be to the fountain head of christianity the better chance they have to check on the truth of the proposition that they believe the less it be in their self interest to be persuade the more need there be for evidence to convince them they rely on the authority of people who declare themselves eye witness of the miracles and resurrection of christ those profess eye witness suffer greatly through give this testimony and finally they seal it with their blood those witness weak and unimportant as they be overcome the world spread more light preach purer morals and do more benefit to mankind than all the philosophers and wise men put together if these proposition be clear and sure as they seem to me to be they constitute plain just and reasonable ground for assent to the christian faith they don rest on any falsehoods they don contain anything beyond our sphere because they don presuppose more knowledge than we have or better faculties than we be actually equip with and even if they aren accept as morally certain as think they will be by fair and unprejudiced inquirers even accept them as only probable be sufficient to stop the mouth of an unbeliever morally certain mean certain enough for all practical purpose it bite vague but be stronger than only probable the pillars of our faith be the above eight plain proposition and not the obscure ones that you suppose which be in fact the unsound uncertain source of unbelief in rash prejudice and assume mind to argue or counter argue on the basis that suppose miracle might be explain by hide power of nature or by magic be grope in the dark but by the evident light of their sense men can be sure enough about perceptible effect and matter of fact such as the miracles and the resurrection of christ and the testimony of such men can be pass on through centuries with the same moral certainty as can other historical narrations and those same miraculous facts when reason have relate them to the doctrines they be bring to prove provide an unbiased mind with strong indications that they have come from god or from superior source as for the fact that jews and gentiles back then attribute our saviour miracles to magic do you count that as evidence against the miracles it seem to be to be positive evidence that those events do occur it doesn square with the christian account of what cause them but it doesn bring any evidence against that account as for the nature and operations of demons the history laws and system of rational be and god scheme or view we don claim to know enough about all this to account for every action and appearance record in the gospel but you don know enough of those things to be entitle to object against account that be so well support by testimony it easy to raise doubt regard many authentic part of civil history events that we find inexplicable because the explanation of them require more knowledge than we have of facts circumstances and councils and it even easier with respect to natural history in that field if surmise be accept as evidence against things that be odd strange and inexplicable if our slight experience be make the rule and measure of truth and no phenomenon be accept unless we with our ignorance of the principles laws and system of nature could explain it we would make discoveries all right discoveries about our own blindness and presumption something that can begin to explain by any rule of logic and good sense be why men who be so easily and so often floor by problems about the natural visible world should yet be so sharp sight and dogmatic about the invisible world and its mysteries expect that ll always be in the dark as you put it about the evidence for the christian religion and always presume there isn any for how be it possible at this remote distance in time to arrive at any knowledge or conduct any demonstrations about it what of it admit that knowledge in strict sense can be have except of something that be either self evident or demonstrate but probable arguments be sufficient basis for faith who ever think that rigorous proof be necessary to make christian all that be need be faith and provide that men be convince in the main and on the whole this save faith can be consistent with some degrees of obscurity doubt and error for although the light of truth be unchangeable in its eternal source the father of light in relation to us it be variously weaken and obscure by pass across long distance or through thick medium in which it be intercept distort or tint by men prejudice and passions but despite all this if you will use your eye you can see enough for the purpose either of nature or of grace although the light you see by be dimmer or brighter depend on the place the distance the time of day and the medium and although there may be much that we can explain in the realms of nature and of grace all that be require for faith to be maintain be that the two should exhibit enough analogy to make it probable that they have the same author be the workmanship of one and the same hand those who saw touch and handle jesus christ after his resurrection if anyone do may be say to have see by clear light but to us the light be very dim and yet we be expect to believe in the resurrection just as they do for my part agree with spinoza that christ death be literal but his resurrection be allegorical and for my part can see anything in this celebrate unbeliever that should make me desert matter of fact and moral evidence so as to adopt his ideas throughout this paragraph evidence mean evidentness in this usage the evidence of proposition refer to how evident be it not about evidence for so matter of fact and moral evidence mean matter of fact and proposition that be morally evident re morally see the note on page do have to allow certain allegorical resurrection mean the resurrection of christ disciples from weakness to resolution from fear to courage from despair to hope and that allegorical resurrection be evidence for the real one because can see how those change in the disciples can be explain except by suppose that they know through their own sense that our lord have truly really literally rise from the dead it can be deny that his disciples who be eye witness of his miracles and resurrection have stronger evidence than we can have of those matter but it also can be deny that at that time there be correspondingly greater need for evidence to induce men to embrace new institution that be contrary to the whole system of their upbringing their prejudice their passions their interest and every human motive still it seem to me that the moral evidence and probable arguments that be within our reach be quite enough to make prudent think men keep to the faith that have be hand down to us from our ancestors and establish by the laws of our country faith require submission on matter that be above our knowledge and for the rest recommend doctrines that best fit our interest and our reason he go on to talk about the advantage that we have of be able to look back at the history of the world during the christian period and see god plan work in it then we can behold christ crucify that stumble block to the jews and foolishness to the greeks put an end to the temple worship of the one and the idolatry of the other but we preach christ crucify unto the jews stumblingblock and unto the greeks foolishness corinthians if due reflection on these things isn enough to create reverence for the christian faith in the mind of men why would that be because men have wise and cautious incredulity anything but that consider how easily men have faith during their daily do where there be no prejudice or appetite to bias or disturb their natural judgment the men who in matter of religion win move an inch unless things be make evident to them and at every turn expect demonstration trust their health to physician and their live to sailor with complete faith can think they deserve the honour of be think harder to convince than other men or that they be more accustom to know and therefore less incline to believe on the contrary it tempt to suspect that our modern unbelief owe more to ignorance than to knowledge this lead to squabble with lysicles about attitudes to careful scholarship and then about the legitimacy of attack christianity by joke and pun and innuendo euphranor join in on that last topic and so finally do although be declare admirer of reason worshipper of reason have to admit that in some case the sharpness of ridicule can do more than the strength of argument but if free thinkers sometimes use mirth and humour it not because we have no other weapons it shall never be say that free thinker be afraid of reason no crito we have reason in store the best be yet to come and if we can find an hour for another conversation before lysicles and set out for london tomorrow morning ll undertake to supply you with reason that be as clear effective and close to the point as you could wish seventh dialogue tuesday we assemble at break of day in the library alciphron begin with declaration of his sincerity assure us he have very maturely and with most unbiased mind consider everything that have be say the day before he add that number of probable reason have be give for accept the christian faith but he say because those reason be only probable they can overcome absolute certainty and demonstration so if can demonstrate rigorously prove that your religion be absurd and inconsistent your probable arguments in defence of it instantly lose their force and with it all right to be answer or consider when sincere and able witness give the same testimony that certainly have great weight in human affairs it can even have enough weight to claim our acceptance of things that be odd and out of line with human judgment and or experience will also concede that it be possible for tradition chain of testimonies to be convey with moral evidence see note on page through many centuries but you must concede that something that demonstrably and obviously false shouldn be accept on the strength of any testimony whatever because however good testimony be it can amount to demonstration to be plain no testimony can turn nonsense into sense no moral evidence can make contradictions consistent well then because the strength of our cause doesn depend on critical point of history chronology or languages it can be decide by any such point don be surprise if the same kind of tradition that govern our assent with respect to facts in civil or natural history be not accept as sufficient support for metaphysical absurdities and absolute impossibilities things that be obscure and unaccountable in human affairs or the operations of nature may nevertheless be possible and if the testimony to them be good enough they may be assent to but religious assent or faith can be plainly show to be intrinsically impracticable impossible and absurd this be the primary reason for unbelief this be our citadel and fortress it may indeed be ornament with extra turrets and supplementary wall of learnedness of various sort but if those be demolish the fortress still stand its own strength make it impregnable well have to admit that this shrink our field of inquiry considerably if you make good on what you have just say ll have nothing more to say it be easy to fool the shallow mind of the vulgar because it attend only to the surface of things and think about them not in detail but en bloc and so we find blind reverence for religious faith and mystery but when sharp philosopher come to dissect and analyse these items of faith the deceit plainly appear and because he isn blind he have no reverence for empty notions or more accurately for mere form of speech that mean nothing and be of no use to mankind the long speech that follow involve theory of mean and understand that be widely accept at the time its principal source be the third book of locke essay concern human understand word be sign they stand for ideas or they ought to and so far as they suggest ideas they be significant word that don suggest any ideas be insignificant someone who associate clear idea with each word that he use speak sense and when such ideas be lack the speaker utter nonsense so if we want to know whether someone speech be senseless and insignificant all we need do be to set aside the word and consider the ideas suggest by them because men can immediately communicate their ideas to one another they have to use sensible sign or word the purpose of which be to raise in the hearer mind the ideas that be already be in the speaker and if they fail to do this they be useless for someone to count as understand what he read or hear he must have sequence of ideas raise in his mind correspond to the sequence of word that he have read or hear these be plain truths that men readily assent to in theory but they aren much attend to in practice so they deserve to be expound in detail and drum into people however obvious and undeniable they may be people in general don much like think but they don mind speak and listen to the speech of others and the effect of that be that their mind be store with name rather than ideas the husk of knowledge rather than knowledge itself and yet these word without mean be often what mark off one party or sect or group of partisans from another form the subject matter of their dispute and the object of their zeal this be the most general cause of error and it isn restrict to ordinary mind even people who be regard as acute and learn philosophers be often busy work at name instead of things or ideas and be think to be express knowledge when really they be only utter hard word without mean knowledge be the perception of the connection or disagreement between ideas and someone who doesn distinctly perceive the ideas associate with the term can form mental proposition correspond to the verbal one so obviously that person can possibly have knowledge he can even be say to have opinion or faith these imply weaker assent than knowledge do but it still have to be assent to proposition and although the agreement or disagreement of the ideas win be as evident as in the case of knowledge the term of the verbal proposition have to be understand just as clearly as they be in knowledge which mean that the conventionally associate ideas must be clearly in the person mind ll say it again all degrees of assent whether base on reason or authority and wherever they be on the spectrum from be compel to believe this at one end to be faintly more incline to accept this than to deny it at the other be internal act of the mind that be direct at ideas without which there really can be any such thing as knowledge faith or opinion we can perhaps raise dust by argue with one another about purely verbal proposition but that be mere trifle all this will be readily agree to with respect to human learn and science here abstract theoretically organise and deductively interlock body of knowledge because in that domain it be generally accept method of expose any doctrine or thesis to strip off its word and examine what ideas if any be underneath this be often find to be the shortest way to end dispute which might otherwise grow and multiply without end with the disputants not understand one another or themselves needn give examples this doctrine about mean and understand shin by its own light and be accept by all think men what shall do be to apply the doctrine to our present topic hope don need to argue that the rule of reason and good sense that hold sway in all other subject ought to be apply in religion also well there be those who consider faith and reason to be two distinct domains and want us to think that good sense have nothing to do with the domain of faith which be in fact the region where it have most to do have decide never to argue with such men but leave them peacefully in possession of their prejudice in apply what have say about ideas and understand to issue in religion shan single out any nit pick dispute in academic theology nor shall pick on any doctrines concern the nature and essence of god because you might counter what say about any of those by claim that god be infinite and that the problem have raise be part of our general difficulty in grasp the nature of infinity the central item in the christian dispensation be grace nothing be mention or consider more often than grace be throughout the new testament which represent it as something of very special kind distinct from anything reveal to the jews or know by the light of nature this same grace be speak of as the gift of god as come through jesus christ as reign as abound as operate men be say to speak through grace and to believe through grace mention be make of the glory of grace the riches of grace the stewards of grace christians be say to be heirs of grace to receive grace grow in grace be strong in grace to stand in grace and to fall from grace and lastly grace be say to justify and to save them hence christianity be style the covenant or dispensation of grace mean that christianity rest on promise that god have make through grace and favour that he have give through grace and it well know that no point have create more controversy in the church than this doctrine of grace there have be many dispute about the nature extent and effect of grace and about the kinds of grace universal efficacious sufficient prevent and irresistible that have employ the pen of protestant as well as roman catholic theologians and he reel off the name of several christian sects not even slightly interest in just what these dispute have be so shan try to list them now all need to make my point be that great contest on these point have exist and still continue what would like to be tell be the answer to this what be the clear and distinct idea associate with the word grace presumably one can know the bare mean of term without go into the depth of all those learn inquiries and controversies this be surely an easy matter provide there be an idea connect to the term and if there isn it can be subject of rational dispute or an object of real faith of course men may indeed deceive themselves or others by claim to argue and believe when basically there be no argument or belief that go beyond mere verbal trifle can easily understand grace in one of its everyday non religious sense grace mean beauty blush womanly grace and grace mean favour the sign of grace that the queen show to raleigh but when grace name an active vital rule principle roughly source of energy or activity see in euphranor speech on page influence and operate on the mind of man and distinct from every natural power or motive declare that can understand it or form any distinct idea of it and therefore can assent to any proposition about it and so can have any faith regard it and it self evident truth that god doesn require anyone to do what he can do when alciphron talk of word as signify distinct idea he may mean that the idea be intrinsically clear or that the idea be distinct from all ideas associate with other word or both in this version distinct will be allow to stand unexplained philosophical friend of mine ask me to look at the write of some theologians that he show me which do and also talk with others on this subject but after all my read and conversations could make nothing of it whenever set aside the word grace and look into my own mind find complete absence of ideas and because suspect that men mind and abilities be much alike suspect that other men if they examine what they call grace with the same exactness and lack of bias would agree with me that there be nothing to it but an empty name this isn the only example of meaningless word that be often hear and speak but be believe to be intelligible simply because it be familiar there be many others that occur in sentence that be say to express necessary article of faith the fraud that grace impose on mankind be think partly the follow men speak of this holy principle as of something that act move and make things happen take their ideas from physical things from motion and the force or momentum of body because body be obvious and perceptible men put them in place of grace spiritual and incomprehensible thing that be clearly delusion even if our idea of bodily force be ever so clear and intelligible it doesn follow that the idea of grace suppose force but one that have nothing bodily about it must be clear and intelligible too and though we can reason clearly perceive assent and form opinions about bodily force it doesn at all follow that we can do the same regard grace and so it come about that clear sense base idea of something real produce or rather be make pretence for an imaginary spiritual faith that isn actually about anything call the faith imaginary because it isn possible for it to be real where there be no ideas there can be any assent and where there be no assent there can be any faith and if something be impossible no man can be oblige to have it or do it that as clear as anything in euclid whatever it be that word be use for can believe that they be use to do impossible things so let us look into what they be use for and see if we can make sense of our daily practice word it be agree be sign so it might be as well to examine the use of other sign so as to understand the use of word counter at card table be use not for their own sake but only as sign substitute for money as word be substitute for ideas tell me alciphron be it necessary every time these counter be use throughout the game to form an idea of the precise amount of money that each represent by no mean all that need be that the players agree on their respective value at the outset and cash them in at those value when the game be over and in add up some number where the figure stand for pound shill and pence do you think it necessary to form ideas of pound shill and pence at each step in the operation don all that be require be for the figure on the bottom line to direct our action appropriately with respect to things it seem to follow from this that word can be significant even if they don every time they be use arouse in our mind the ideas that they signify because it enough for meaningfulness if we have it in our power to substitute things or ideas for the word when there be call for it it seem to follow also that word have use additional to that of mark and suggest distinct ideas namely influence our behaviour and there be two ways for them to do that form rule for us to act by and arouse certain passions dispositions and emotions in our mind so it seem that discourse that tell us how to act or spur the do or not do of an action can be useful and significant even if the word make it up don each bring distinct idea into our mind it seem so tell me alciphron isn an idea altogether inactive it be so an agent something that do things an active mind or spirit can be an idea and can be like an idea from which it would seem to follow that the word that stand for an active principle soul or spirit don stand for ideas in the strict and proper sense of ideas but they aren insignificant or meaningless as can show through one really strike example namely the word or the word myself as use by me understand what it signify know what it mean but what it signify isn an idea and isn like an idea rather it be something that think and will and grasp ideas and do things with them it can be deny that we know what be mean by the term myself will memory love hate and so forth we have some notion that we understand relate to them even though strictly speak these word don suggest distinct ideas to us in this version of the seventh dialogue the use of idea and notion will exactly track berkeley what would you infer from this what have infer already namely that word can be significant without stand for ideas it because people think otherwise that the doctrine of abstract ideas have arise do you deny that the mind can abstract don deny that it can abstract in certain sense of that word we can think about one thing separately from another if but only if they could exist separately and could be perceive separately so we can abstract by think about man head and not about his body or think about colour without think about motion or think about shape without think about weight but it doesn follow from this that the mind can frame abstract general ideas think about colour without think about any specific hue which appear to be impossible yet it be generally think these days that every noun replace substantive name here and throughout mark out and exhibit to the mind one distinct idea separate from all others tell me alciphron isn the word number noun it be well now see if you can form an idea of number in abstract not bring verbal sign or things that be number speak for myself can can it be so difficult to form simple idea of number which be the subject matter of most evident demonstrable science wait bite let me see if can abstract the idea of number from number word and numerals and from all particular countable things long pause to tell the truth don find that can apparently then neither you nor can form distinct simple ideas of number and yet we can make very proper and significant use of number word and numerals they direct us in the management of our affairs and do it in such an essential way that we would be lose without them and yet if other men abilities be like mine achieve precise simple abstract idea of number be as difficult as be comprehend any mystery in religion to come now to your example let us examine what idea we can form of force abstract from body motion and outward perceptible effect speak again for myself don find that have or can have any such idea surely everyone know what be mean by force and yet question whether everyone can form distinct idea of force beg you alciphron don be distract by word set aside the word force and exclude everything else from your thoughts and then see what precise idea you have of force force be that in body which produce motion and other perceptible effect it be then something distinct from those effect it be well then please now set aside any think of the thing that have the force and the effect that follow from it and contemplate force itself through its own precise idea have to say that find it difficult shut your eye to assist your meditation alciphron close his eye and think for few minutes and then declare that he couldn do it well then reply euphranor there be something that it seem neither you nor can form an idea of and your own remark that men mind and abilities be much alike imply that no one else have any more of an idea of it than we do it do and yet there be certainly many speculations reason and dispute refine subtleties and intricate distinctions relate to this same force and to explain its nature and mark out the different notions of it or kinds of it learn men have use the term gravity reaction inertial force inherent force immediate force dead force live force momentum solicitatio conatus and various other such expressions and big controversies have arise about the notions or definitions of these term men have want to know whether force be spiritual or bodily whether it remain after action how it be transfer from one body to another strange paradoxes have be concoct about its nature properties and proportion for instance that opposite force can exist at the same time in the same quiescent body that the force of percussion in small particle be infinite he name book in which detail can be find and go on at some length about controversies between leibniz and others over force in physics then the ingenious toricelli say concern the momentum and the velocity of heavy fall body that they be certain something and an don know what what do all this tell us about the idea of force just force itself set aside body time space motion and all the perceptible measure of force can we say that it as difficult to form an idea of force as to form an idea of grace don know what to think about that but presume you ll agree that some proposition or theorems relate to force be obviously true and also useful for instance what berkeley write that body with conjunct force describe the diagonal of parallelogram in the same time that it would the side with separate what he ought to have mean if body be subject to two force represent them by two line draw from single point direction represent direction and length represent strength add two more line to complete parallelogram the resultant force on the body be represent by the diagonal of the parallelogram isn this theorem very widely useful doesn the doctrine of the composition and resolution of force depend on it and through that countless rule and theorems tell us how to act and explain phenomena all through mechanics and mathematical physics and if this theorem help men to get the knowledge of many inventions in mechanics and teach them how to make engines that they can use to do things that be otherwise hard or impossible and provide key to discover the nature of planetary motion in addition to all its usefulness here on earth be we go to say that it be not practically or theoretically useful because we have no distinct idea of force obviously not well give that we take that line with force what excuse have we for go different way with grace if there be query dispute perplexities and diverge notions and opinions about grace so there be about force also if we can form any precise distinct idea of grace neither can we of force oughtn we by parity of reason to conclude that there may be various true and useful proposition about grace just as there be about force and oughtn you also to conclude that grace may for all you know to the contrary be an object of our faith and influence our life and action by attack evil habit and support good ones even though we can get distinct idea of grace all on its own separate or abstract from god who produce it man who receive it and virtue and piety that result from it shan we allow the same method of argue the same rule of logic reason and good sense to hold sway in spiritual matter as in physical ones in faith as well as in physics and when we be examine god revelations shan we use the same candour and make the same allowance as we do when examine the discoveries of men can see how philosopher can be free from bias and prejudice or be say to weigh things in an equal balance if he maintain the doctrine of force and reject that of grace or admit the abstract idea of triangle while ridicule the holy trinity anyway however partial or prejudice other minute philosophers may be you have lay it down as maxim that the same logic which govern in other matter must be admit in religion alciphron think you do better to stay with the method of wit and humour rather than try religion by the dry test of reason and logic don worry by all the rule of right reason it be absolutely impossible that any mystery especially the trinity should really be the object of man faith not surprise that you think so while you hold that no one could assent to verbal proposition without form in his mind distinct ideas associate with the word in it but you have agree that those sign can be significant even if they don suggest ideas represent by them provide they serve to regulate and influence our will passions or behaviour which commit you to agree also that man mind can assent to proposition contain such term when it be direct or affect by them even if it doesn perceive in itself distinct ideas mark by those term it seem to follow from this that man can believe the doctrine of the trinity if he find it reveal in the bible that the father the son and the holy ghost be god and that there be only one god he can believe this doctrine of creator redeemer and sanctifier three persons make one substance even though he doesn form in his mind any abstract or distinct ideas of trinity person or substance provide that the doctrine have the right effect on his mind produce in it love hope gratitude and obedience thereby become lively operative principle that influence his life and action in ways that fit with the notion of save faith that be require in christian whether this be right or wrong it seem to follow from what you have declare together with what you have concede wonder if there be anything parallel to this christian faith in the minute philosophy suppose fine gentleman or lady of fashion who be too busy to think for themselves and be only free thinkers at second hand have the advantage of be initiate quite early into the principles of your sect by listen to men of depth and genius who have often express the opinion that the world be govern either by fate or by chance and it doesn matter which see note on page you win deny that it be possible for such persons to give their assent to either of these proposition the fate one and the chance one ii and their assent can properly be call faith iii and yet these disciples of the minute philosophy may be unable to dive deep enough to form any abstract or precise or definite idea of fate or of chance iv so that this same gentleman or lady may be say to believe or have faith where they don have ideas and this faith or conviction can produce real effect show itself in the conduct and tone of their live free them from the fear of superstition and give them true like for the world with noble indifference about any after life and can christians with equal reason be allow to believe in the divinity of our saviour or believe that in him god and man make one person and be genuinely convince of this so that this faith or belief become real principle of life and conduct because of this belief that they have they submit to his government believe his doctrine and behave accord to his precepts even though they don form any abstract idea of the union between the divine and human nature and even though they can clear up the notion of person in way that will satisfy minute philosopher it seem obvious to me that we wouldn so often be face with demand for clear and distinct idea of person in relation to the trinity and wouldn so often find difficulties about this be treat as objections to our faith if these demand and objections be make only by people who have delicately examine and could themselves explain the principle of individuation in man or could untie the knot and answer the objections that can be raise even about human personal identity alciphron say that he doesn think there be any great mystery in personal identity and express agreement with locke theory about this that be an open for euphranor to argue against locke thesis that as euphranor put it personal identity consist in consciousness the argument be not worth much as it be base on stunningly absurdly uncharitable read of locke it be launch by reid essay on the intellectual power of man essay chapter anyway this interchange contribute nothing to the rest of the dialogue which euphranor put back on track thus there be think practical kind of faith or assent that show itself in the will and action of man even if his understand isn furnish with correspond abstract precise distinct ideas you indeed have concede that there be many instance of such practical faith in other matter that don involve religion so why shouldn it be that doctrines relate to heavenly mysteries might also be teach in this save sense to common mind that you may well think incapable of all teach and faith of the sort you have be demand this mistake view of teach and faith say crito have lead to great deal of profane and misapply sarcasm but all that can fairly bounce back onto the minute philosophers themselves who muddle scholasticism with christianity and impute to other men the perplexities chimeras and inconsistent ideas that be often the work of their own brain and argue on the basis of their own wrong way of think anyone can see that such an ideal abstract faith be never think of by the great majority of christians farmers for example and artisans and servants and there nothing in the bible to suggest that either jews or christians be require to engage in the delicately precise form of abstract ideas nothing like this be to be find in the law or the prophets the evangelists or the apostles everyone whose understand be not pervert by science falsely so call can see that the save faith of christians be of quite another kind vital operative principle roughly source of energy or activity see in euphranor speech on page that generate charity and obedience then what can we make of the dispute and decisions of the famous council of nicaea which draw up the so call nicene creed and all the councils since that one what be the intention of those venerable father the homoousians and the homoiousians why do they disturb themselves and the world with hard word and subtle controversies those be greek word mean respectively the same and similar the controversy be between two view about the relationship of the son to the father whatever their intention be it couldn have be to do something that be obviously impossible namely create precise abstract ideas of mysteries in the mind of common christians there no evidence that the majority of christians in those days think they be oblige to set aside word shut their eye and form abstract ideas any more than men now form abstract ideas of force time number or many other things about which they nevertheless believe know argue and dispute it seem to me that whatever be the source of that controversy and however it be conduct what it be really about be not desire by either side to convey precise positive ideas to the mind of men by the use of those controversial term but rather something negative namely desire to exclude on one side the view that there be three gods and on the other the view that there be just one god of whom the father the son and the holy ghost be merely three aspects but so many learn and ingenious theologians have from time to time offer the world new explanations of mysteries claim to have work to get accurate ideas and want to recommend their discoveries and speculations to others as article of faith what be we to make of them to all such innovators in religion would say with hieronymus why after so many centuries do you claim to teach us something that hasn be teach before why explain things that neither peter nor paul think need to be explain the explanation of mysteries in divinity be as futile as the pursuit of the philosopher stone see note on page in chemistry or the perpetual motion machine in mechanics but in each of the three case the absurdity be to be blame not on that branch of enquiry but only on wrong head people engage in it what euphranor have be say seem to be applicable also to other mysteries of our religion we may find it impossible to form an abstract idea of original sin for example or an idea of how original sin be pass on from adam to the rest of us but the belief in it may produce in someone mind salutary sense of his own unworthiness and of the goodness of his redeemer and from that may follow good habit and from them good action which be the genuine effect of faith when faith be consider in its true light it can be see to be neither inconsistent nor incomprehensible as some men want us to think it be but suit even to common capacities place in the will and affections rather than in the understand and produce holy live rather than subtle theories faith isn something you passively let flow into you it an operative conviction of mind which always produce some suitable action disposition or emotion in those who have it could easily prove and illustrate this by countless instance take from human affairs and indeed while the christian religion be consider as an institution fit to ordinary mind rather than to the mind of hair split theoreticians and while our notions about faith be accordingly take from mankind ordinary everyday life rather than from the special systems of faith improvers don think it will be hard to understand the mean and use of our belief in mysteries and to justify them against the most confident assertions and objections of the minute philosophers who can easily be catch in the very trap that they have set for others and that spirit of controversy the mother and nurse of heresies would doubtless be much reduce if men would grasp that things should be rat not by their colour shape or trade mark so truly as by their weight if some litigious theologians have proportion their zeal to the importance of the opinions they be propound that would greatly reduce the zealous intensity of most of what they have to say which would have spar them and us great deal of trouble someone who take his notions of faith opinion and assent from common sense and common usage and have maturely weigh the nature of sign and of language win be so ready to quarrel about the word of mystery or to break the peace of the church so as to retain or reject word here plain example that should convince you of the effective and necessary use of faith without ideas the example concern convince minute philosopher coarse and callous man with large appetites and not much money who have an opportunity to perform one villainous act that will make him rich an act that he know he can get away with what be there to deter him certainly not sense of the beauty of virtue see alciphron speech on page in fact the only way to get some moral leverage on this man be to produce in him sincere belief in future state although it be mystery although it be what eye have not see nor ear hear nor have it enter into the heart of man to conceive corinthians this belief will restrain him from carry out his wicked project to reasonable reflective philosophical mind the point insist on by your refine beauty of virtue moralists may be as lovely and excellent as you please but venture to say that give mankind as it be very few people would be influence by them so we see the necessary use of faith as well as its powerful effect and none of this involve have ideas you and euphranor apparently want to convince me that the belief in mysteries doesn involve anything as utterly absurd as we be apt to think and that man needn renounce his reason to maintain his religion but if this be true why be it that men faith dwindle in proportion as their knowledge grow have learn from you alciphron that there be nothing like get to the bottom of things and analyse them into their basic elements so ll try to do that with the question of the nature of faith you ll have to judge whether succeed the objections that be make to faith don come from knowledge but rather from ignorance of what knowledge be and that ignorance might be find even in people who be regard as master of this or that particular branch of knowledge science and faith have this in common they both involve an assent of the mind and as the nature of scientific assent be most clear and evident we should consider it first in order to cast light on the assent involve in faith to trace things back to their origins the human mind need aid that be not part of its basic natural equipment it be naturally furnish with the ideas of particular and concrete as distinct from abstract things and what it design for be not merely be aware of its ideas but pursue its own happiness by actively operate on the basis of them for the scientific pursuit of knowledge about the origins of things therefore the mind need extra help specifically it need certain general rule or theorems to guide it in this pursuit and the true original reasonable end of study the arts and sciences be to acquire such rule because these rule be general they can be obtain by the mere consideration of the original ideas or particular things but only by mean of mark or sign and these be general in the sense that they be use for general purpose become the immediate instrument and materials of science so the mind make its progress not by mere contemplation of particular things even less by contemplate abstract general ideas of things but by appropriately choose and skillfully manage sign for example everyone know about force and number in concrete situations along with things that accompany them things that have them and sign of them and no one have any understand of force and number consider in the abstract and capture in precise abstract ideas so it clear that their abstract nature isn foundation for science and that merely consider their ideas in their concrete form isn the way to advance in the respective sciences of physics and mathematics because nothing be more evident than that someone who can read or write understand the mean of numeral word in concrete situations as well as the best scientist or mathematician but here lie the difference the one who understand the notation of number can use it to express briefly and clearly all the variety and degrees of number and to perform easily and quickly many arithmetical operations by the help of general rule it obvious how useful these operations be in human life and equally obvious that perform them require have an appropriate notation if mankind be in very primitive state with no use of language they wouldn know any truths of arithmetic their first step towards that science would be the acquisition of name for number so that they could signify number as high as you like by repeat those name in certain order the next step would be to associate those name with visible mark permanent ones not like sound which don last if this system of mark this notation be do well it would make it easier for us to discover and apply general rule to assist the mind in reason and judge and in extend record and communicate its knowledge about number what the mind be immediately concern with in these activities be the sign or numerals through which it be direct to act in relation to things or number in concrete as the logicians call it without ever consider the simple abstract intellectual general idea of number don think it be hard to be convince that the science of arithmetic be entirely concern in its rise operations rule and theorems with the conventional use of sign which be of two sort name that be word and numerals these name and numerals be in their roles as sign universal the name be relate to things the character be relate to the name and both name and character be relate to operations there aren many basic name of number the stock of them be enlarge by certain analogy so system of character will be useful to the extent that it be simple and aptly express this analogy thus word write at length be less useful than the old roman numerals which in turn be less useful than the modern notation for example two hundred and forty four be less useful than ccxliv which be less useful than and the invention of algebraical symbols be further advance for extensive and general use so there we have it arithmetic and algebra be sciences of great clearness certainty and extent whose immediate topic be sign on the skillful use and management of which they entirely depend perhaps little attention to them may help us to understand the progress of the mind in other sciences which differ in nature design and purpose but may nevertheless agree in the general methods of proof and inquiry in my view all sciences that be universal and demonstrable by human reason will be find to have sign as their immediate object though in apply science we connect these sign with things it isn hard to grasp why this be so nothing be more natural for us than to use the things we do know as step stone towards things we don know and to explain and represent less familiar things by others that be more familiar now it be certain that before we reflect we imagine and before we imagine we perceive by our sense and that of all our sense eyesight be the most clear distinct various agreeable and comprehensive so it natural for us to help the intellect by imagination to help imagination by sense and to help the other sense by sight hence figure metaphors and symbols we illustrate mental things by physical ones we substitute sound for thoughts and write letter for sound we use emblems symbols and hieroglyphics for things that be too obscure to strike our mind and too various or too fleet to be retain we substitute imaginable things for intelligible ones sensible things for imaginable ones smaller things for ones that be too big to comprehend easily and larger things for ones that be too small to be clearly pick out present things for absent ones permanent things for perish ones and visible things for invisible ones hence the use of model and diagram thus line be substitute for time velocity and other things of very different natures thus again we speak of mind in figurative way describe their operations by term borrow from perceptible things such as apprehend conceive reflect discourse and the like apprehend come from latin mean seize conceive from take together reflect from bend back discourse from run to and fro euphranor talk little about allegories plato represent the mind by the driver of wing chariot which etc etc then incline to think that the doctrine of sign matter great deal over very wide area and that if it be properly consider it would cast lot of light on things and provide genuine solution for many difficulties so we can say this much about all sign they don always suggest ideas signify to the mind when they do suggest ideas they aren general abstract ideas they have other use such as raise proper emotions produce certain dispositions or habit of mind and direct our action in pursuit of the happiness that be the ultimate end and design the primary spring and motive that set rational agents at work the real purpose of speech whether it be be use in reason or in express theoretical knowledge or faith or some degree of belief be not primarily to give or get ideas but rather to guide action aim at bring about some conceive good sometimes indeed word can lead to suitable action not merely without communicate any ideas but without such ideas be even possible an example be the algebraic sign stand for the square root of negative number this be useful in logical operations although it be impossible to have an idea of any such quantity as and what be true of algebraic sign be also true of word or language in fact modern algebra be language compact appropriate artificial sort of language and any algebraic calculation could be express by ordinary word much less conveniently but with nothing leave out also there no avoid the fact that even the mathematical sciences themselves suppose to the most clear and certain sciences that we have often fall short of the clear and distinct ideas that today minute philosophers whether knowingly or ignorantly insist on in the mysteries of religion talk here about mathematics consider as theory not about practical apply mathematics in absolutely any science or field of activity men will be sure to embarrass themselves with difficulties and dispute if they move from particulars to generalities from concrete things to abstractions or relinquish practical view and the useful purpose of knowledge in favour of barren theorise regard mean and instrument as ultimate end and struggle to get the precise ideas that they suppose to be associate with all word talk about difficulties and dispute such as the ones that have spring up in geometry about the nature of the angle of contact between circle and its tangent proportion indivisibles infinitesimals and various other matter despite all of which geometry itself be rightly admire as an excellent and useful science it really do prove useful in many real life situations where it govern and direct the action of men enable them to do in sound and accurate way things that would otherwise be faulty and uncertain and by parity of reason we shouldn regard any other doctrines that govern influence or direct the mind of man to be less true or excellent because they provide material for controversy and useless theorize by trouble makers this apply especially to the article of our christian faith with regard to which belief lead to persuasion which in turn influence the live and action of men as for the perplexity of contradictions and abstract notions that crop up in secular sciences and divine faith nit pickers may use it as an objection incautious people may stray into it while judicious people keep away from it the belief of christians can be justify without depart from the accept rule of reason and if any pious men think otherwise that probably result not of religion or of reason but merely of human weakness if there be especially many unbelievers in our time shan conclude that our time know more than former age only that it be more arrogantly self confident and don think that this confidence be result of much think it seem to me that the more thoroughly and extensively any man investigate and think about the principles aim and methods that occur in secular arts and sciences the more convince he will be that there no weight in the plausible objections that be bring against the mysteries of faith and he win have much difficulty maintain and justify his position use accept methods of argument and the common principles of logic appeal to countless parallel case all through the many branch of human knowledge in all of which the supposition of abstract ideas create the same difficulties accord to this doctrine anything can be maintain there ll be nothing absurd in popery not even in transubstantiation the doctrine that in the sacrament of the eucharist the bread and wine become the body and blood of jesus pardon me what have be say doesn justify any article of faith that isn contain in scripture be in conflict with human reason imply contradiction or lead to idolatry or wickedness of any kind those four disqualifiers be very different from not be representable by distinct or abstract ideas ll allow euphranor that your reason have all the force you mean it to have freely admit that there may be mysteries that we can believe things that we don understand and that faith can be useful even when what it about be not distinctly grasp in short agree that there can be faith and mysteries in other things but not in religion the plain reason for this be that it absurd to suppose there to be any such thing as religion and if there no religion then there can be religious faith or mysteries religion obviously imply the worship of god which worship presuppose reward and punishments which presuppose merit and demerits good and evil action and these presuppose human freedom and that be impossible which mean that religion which be build on it must be unreasonable and absurd it can be reasonable to have fear where there be no guilt and there can be guilt when everything that happen follow unavoidably from the structure of the world and the laws of motion here be what happen when man as we say raise his hand to shade his eye from the sun physical object strike on his sense organs specifically light particles strike his eye those organs the eye start vibration in the nerve that vibration be pass along to the soul or animal spirit in the brain or root of the nerve see note on page start up in them the kind of motion call volition the volition start up new movement in the animal spirit this cause the spirit to flow into certain nerve the events in those nerve cause bodily movements that constitute the action in question in our case cause his hand to go up over his eye and all of this happen necessarily by the laws of mechanism so the events that we ordinarily take to be human action should be regard as mechanical and it just wrong to think they have source that be free so there be no basis for praise or blame fear or hope reward or punishment and religion as have already point out be build on and presuppose those things if have understand you rightly alciphron you regard man as sort of organ that be play on by external object which produce different motion and effect in the organ depend on the different shape and textures of the nerve the comparison with an organ be not bad but the best comparison be with puppet certain particles come in straight line from all perceptible object compose so many ray or filaments that push pull and activate every part of the soul and body of man just as thread or wire operate on the joint of the little wooden machine ordinarily call puppet the only difference be that the puppet wire be thick and visible to ordinary eye whereas the former the ray or filaments that enter into the causation of human so call action be too fine and subtle to be spot by any but an able free thinker this splendidly account for all the operations that we have be teach to ascribe to source of think within us that an ingenious line of think and must contribute greatly to free men from all anxiety about moral notions by trace their action not to source in the human soul but rather to external things but have some worry about it you suppose the mind to be in literal sense move and you take its volitions to be mere motion but suppose someone say and let face it someone may that the soul be not body that motion be one thing and volition another like to know how you would go about convince such person your account will be very clear to those who accept that the soul be body and that all its act be merely motion give that basis our account of human nature be true fine and new but if someone deny your supposition that the soul be corporeal denial that it very easy to make then everything you have build on it collapse if we grant that the soul be body and volitions be motion we be certainly commit then to fatal necessity to the view that all our action be necessary in the sense that whatever we do we be fat to do bind to do inevitably go to do but see no reason for grant those two point on the contrary it seem clear that motion and think be two things as really and as obviously distinct from one another as triangle be from sound so it look as though your argument for the necessity of human action have premise that need to be prove just as badly as the conclusion do well if we suppose that the mind be not corporeal can still prove my conclusion shan baffle you with far fetch arguments and merely ask you to look into yourself and observe what happen when some object come before your mind your understand consider it then your judgment make some decree about it as thing to be choose or reject to be do or not do and if do then do thus and not so this decree of the judgment necessarily determine the will whose role be merely to carry out anything ordain by another faculty something necessary can be free so there no such thing as freedom of the will freedom be present only when there be an indifference to either side of the question when the deliberate mind be evenly poise between the alternatives power to act or not act without be tell what to do or in any way control by something external to the will and it obvious that the will can be free when it doesn have this indifference and this power and it equally obvious that the will be not indifferent in its action be absolutely determine and govern by the faculty of judgment my point be not affect by the question of what it be that move the judgment whether it the greatest present uneasiness as locke come to think or the greatest apparent good as many have think include locke to begin with or something else again whatever it be that move the judgment the fact remain that the will be always settle and control by the judgment and so be always subject to necessity nowhere in the entire human make up be there anything like free agent every faculty be determine in all its act by something external to it the understand for instance can alter one of its ideas it necessarily see each idea in the way that it present itself the appetites be carry towards their respective object by natural necessity reason can infer anything from anything just as it choose it be limit by the nature and connection of things and the eternal rule of reason which mean that it be subject to necessity and the same be true for all our other faculties as well as for the will itself as have already show and if we can believe the divine characterizer of our time the will must be agree to be the most slavish of all our faculties the earl of shaftesbury author of characteristics of etc be widely like and admire but even alciphron wouldn call him divine in make him do so berkeley be throw in sarcastic jibe of his own some admirers of the present work regret its intemperate hostility to shaftesbury appetite say that noble writer which be reason older and stronger brother be sure in every contest to be on the win side as for the will so highly boast of it be never better than football for those youngsters to kick or spin top for them to whip to keep it move the youngsters turn out to be very ill match and eventually the younger of them instead of now and then get in kick or lash to little purpose leave the ball or top and start to kick or lash his older brother crito comment sarcastically on the style and manner of this beautiful parable and ask why the weaker brother would get satisfaction from attack the stronger one alciphron brush this off and then the same conclusion can also prove from god foreknowledge whatever be certainly foreknow will certainly happen what will certainly happen be necessary necessary action can be the effect of free will so now you have this fundamental thesis in our free think philosophy demonstrate in two different ways see note on page the proposition that god create something that be free be not self contradictory ii so it be possible that there may be such thing as free creature iii this be something that you can conceive and suppose iv such free creature would think that he act and he would condemn himself for some action and approve of himself for others vi he would think that he deserve reward or punishment vii and all these characteristics be actually find in man tell me now what other qualities do your suppose free agent have ones that be not to be find in man if there aren any we must conclude that man have all the mark of free agent let me see be certainly mistake when concede that it be possible at least for almighty power to make such thing as free agent wonder how come to make such an absurd concession after what have be demonstrate in so many different ways certainly whatever doesn imply contradiction be possible for an infinite power and whatever be possible can be suppose therefore if rational agent isn self contradictory then rational agent can be suppose perhaps from this supposition might infer that man be free but win suppose him to be free agent since you apparently claim to have demonstrate that he isn but listen it common knowledge that men base their opinions about others on themselves but when you reach conclusion about me on the basis of what you know about yourself you may be mistake many things that be clear to someone with your strength of intellect be not so clear to me who be often puzzle rather than enlighten by those very proof that you regard as clear and evident can be thoroughly convince by any inference however logically sound it be if its premise aren clear so please let me put question to you your answer may sort out for me the things that at present be confuse about ll leave with you what have already say for you to consider and chew over it time now for lysicles and me to set out for london so there no time for long question and answer session then let me make couple of brief remark on what you have say you take that for grant something that can not grant when you say that whatever be certain be necessary to me certain and necessary seem to be very different because there nothing in certain that imply constraint and so there nothing in it that isn consistent with man be accountable for his action if it be foresee that such and such an action will be do can it also be foresee that it will be do as an effect of human choice and liberty you delicately abstract and distinguish the action of the mind judgment and will you use such term as power faculty act determination indifference freedom necessity and so on as if they stand for distinct abstract ideas and this supposition seem to ensnare the mind into the same perplexities and errors that have be see to accompany the doctrine of abstraction in every other context it self evident that there be such thing as motion and yet some philosophers have try by refine reason to prove there be no such thing walk before them be think the proper way to confute those ingenious men diogenes be report to have say à propos of zeno difficulty about how there could be motion solve it by walk it be equally obvious that man be free agent and though by abstract reason you might puzzle me and seem to prove that he isn so long as be conscious of my own action this inward evidentness of plain fact will bear me up against all your reason however subtle and refine they may be oppose plain proposition by obscure ones may convince me that your philosophers be clever but it win convince me that their opinions be true can conceive why the acute cratylus shaftesbury in his football metaphor page should allow power of act to the appetite and to reason the brothers but not to the will the football if we allow that the mind do contain these three distinct be don see how this could be true of them but don find it necessary to abstract and distinguish as many be in the soul of man as you do which reconcile me to the fact that can do so without any such distinction it be evident to me take myself as whole not as minutely dissect that be free agent not help to go further by be tell that the will be govern by the judgment or that it be determine by the object because in no ordinary everyday case can separate the decree of my judgment from the command of my will know that the sensible object be absolutely inert and so can determine anything and lastly be conscious that be an active be who can and do determine myself don know what theoretical result might get if be to suppose spiritual or mental things to be corporeal or to refine actual and real things into general abstract notions or by metaphysical skill to split simple and individual things into many part but if instead of any of that take things as they be and ask any plain untutored man whether he act or be free in this or that particular action he immediately say yes and immediately believe him on the basis of what find within myself and thus by an induction from particular case can draw the general conclusion that man be free agent even if can define or conceive an abstract notion of freedom in general if man be free he be clearly accountable and if you define and abstract and suppose and infer from your definitions abstractions and suppositions that there can be any freedom in man and then infer from this that he isn accountable shall take the liberty of depart from your metaphysical abstract sense and appeal to the common sense of mankind if we consider the notions people have of guilt and merit praise and blame accountable and unaccountable we ll find the question of whether to applaud or censure someone acquit or condemn him always rest on the question do he perform the action in question or what come to the same thing be he himself when he perform it so it seem that in our ordinary everyday think and talk person be regard as accountable if he be an agent you tell me that man be inactive and that perceptible object act on him but my own experience assure me of the contrary know act and be accountable for what do in act and if this be true then the foundation of religion and morality remain unshaken the only question in this area that religion be concern with be whether the man be accountable and accord to my sense and the world common sense he be accountable if he act and it self evident that he do act so the ground and purpose of religion be secure whether or not your philosophic notion of liberty fit man action and whether or not his action be certain or contingent do he deserve the guilt or merit of the action in ask that we aren ask do he do it with free will or what determine his will when he do it or be it certain or foreknow that he would do it the only question be do he do it wilfully but still the question keep come back be man free to answer this oughtn we first to settle what be mean by the word free we ought in my opinion man be say to be free insofar as he can do what he will to do isn that right it seem so so man who act accord to his will be to be account free admit that this be right in the vulgar see note on page sense of free but philosopher go higher than that and ask whether man be free to will that be whether he can will as he will don know how philosophical it may be to ask this question but to me it seem very idle the notions of guilt and merit justice and reward be in men mind in advance of any metaphysical lecture or chapters and accord to those accept natural notions there be no doubt that man be accountable that he act that he be self determine but minute philosopher mislead by wrong initial suppositions run together things that be obviously distinct body spirit motion volition certainty necessity and an abstracter or refiner analyse the simplest instantaneous act of the mind to the point where he think he can find within it various faculties and tendencies principles and operations cause and effect note the symmetry identify things that be really distinct and distinguish things that be really identical and after he have abstract suppose and reason concern gratuitous and obscure principles he will conclude that the act in question isn an act at all and that man be not an agent but puppet or an organ play on by external object and his will be top or football and this pass for philosophy and free think whatever it pass for it doesn at all seem like natural or sound way of think it seem to me that if we start from things that be particular and concrete and proceed from them to general notions and conclusions we ll have no trouble in this area but if we start with generalities and lay our foundations in abstract ideas we ll find ourselves entangle and lose in labyrinth of our own make needn point out because anyone can see it how ridiculous it be to claim to prove that man be not an agent while also plead for free think and action thus pose as advocate of necessity and of liberty have hastily throw together these hint or remark about this fundamental thesis in our free think philosophy as you call it and about your method of argue for it which seem to provide fine specimen of the sophistry of abstract ideas if my brevity have lead me to be inappropriately dogmatic you must excuse me you start it by decline to join me in leisurely examination of the truth think we have examine matter sufficiently to everything you have say against human liberty it be sufficient answer to point out that your arguments be wrong from the outset either because they suppose the soul to be corporeal or because they rely on abstract ideas suppose the soul to be solid be no better than suppose it to be red or blue suppose the will to consist in motion be no better than suppose the will to be you name it these premise about the soul and the will be to put it mildly neither prove nor probable and see no obstacle to reject everything you infer from them and your arguments also contain other gross mistake and baseless principles in any human action you distinguish the last decree of the judgment from the act of the will you confuse certainty with necessity you ask in effect the absurd question can man will as he will the proposition man will as he will be an identical one necessarily true logical triviality that be obviously the case which mean that obviously there must be something wrong with the line of think that lead you to make question of it you say that the appetites have by natural necessity tendency towards their respective object agree and add my agreement that appetites be not free but you go further tell us the understand can alter an idea that it have nor can it infer indifferently anything from anything just as it choose what of it if we can alter the nature of object do that mean that we can act at all the two versions of reflect berkeley view defend in other work but mainly not in play in this one that the object that we perceive and talk about be ideas and if we aren at liberty to make absurd inferences do it follow that we aren free in any way you take it for grant that the mind be inactive but that its ideas act on it as if the contrary weren evident to everyone who have the common sense to know that when the mind consider its ideas it choose reject examine deliberate decree it act on them and they don act on it sum up because your premise be obscure and false the basic point that you claim to have demonstrate in so many different ways isn show to be true or even meaningful and on the other hand we don have to do much research to be convince that man act and that man be accountable for his action nothing be clearer or more obvious than those two proposition nothing be more universally accept by men of all sort learn and unlearn at all time and in all place whatever may be claim by abstracters refiners and men who be commit to false hypothesis think it be obvious to every think man of common sense that human mind be so far from be machine or footballs act on and kick around by corporeal object with no inner source of freedom or of action that the only basic true notions we have of freedom agent and action be ones we get by reflect on ourselves and the operations of our own mind the minute philosophers allow themselves to be take in by the invalid inferences of three or four eminent bishops of unbelief in recent time can think of anything that match their unique credulity any other bigoted superstition whose ringleaders have be able so openly and widely to draw their followers from the plain dictate of nature and common sense the discoverers of truth have always meet up with the objection that they be depart from accept opinions the sneer label unique be tax on free think and as such we most willingly accept it and glory in it genuine philosopher be never modest in such way as to prefer authority to reason or an old and common opinion to true one such false modesty discourage men from tread in untrodden paths and from shin new light and that make it greater enemy to free think than any other personal quality judicious person who will follow evidence wherever it lead will also allow authority to have its due weight on disputable point without prefer authority we can accept it as good back up to reason so your gentlemen of the minute philosophy can save yourself the trouble of announce all those commonplaces about reason and discoveries and light we aren attach to authority against reason or afraid of untrodden paths that lead to truth and we be ready to follow new light once we be sure it isn will the wisp reason may oblige man to believe something that he doesn like but why should man give up salutary notions in favour of others that be as unreasonable as they be harmful your scheme principles and boast demonstrations have be propose and examine at length you have shift your notions successively retreat from one scheme to another and in the end renounce them all your objections to christianity have be treat in the same manner and with the same outcome if from the things you have hold against christianity we set aside everything that come from the errors and fault of particular persons and difficulties which from the nature of things we aren oblige to explain it be surprise to see how little remain after such magnificent threats that can amount to relevant objection against the christian religion what you have produce have be try by the fair test of reason and even if you hope to get the upper hand through ridicule when you can get it through reason predict that in the upshot you ll find that you can destroy all sense of religion how berkeley start the next sentence make your countrymen ever so vicious ignorant and profane either he mean however vicious ignorant and profane you claim your countrymen to be or he mean however vicious ignorant and profane you cause your countrymen to be men will still be dispose to look up to supreme be religion right or wrong will survive in some shape or other and there will surely be some worship either of god or the creature that be berkeley phrase mean as for your ridicule well your sect present us with the spectacle of the most unintelligible men of the age parade themselves as free thinkers men so strong in assertion yet so weak in argument advocate for freedom introduce necessity patriots trample on the laws of their country claimants to virtue destroy the motives for virtue can anything be more ridiculous than that let any impartial man cast an eye on the opinions of the minute philosophers and then say if anything can be more ridiculous than to believe such things and at the same time laugh at the credulity of others say what you will we have the laughers on our side and as for your reason take that to be another name for sophistry and suppose by the same rule you take your own sophisms to be arguments let me be frank about this don know of any type of sophism any type of logical mistake that minute philosophers don use against religion they be guilty of work from false assumptions in take it for grant that we believe contradictions of bad causal think in assert that uncharitable feud and discord be the effect of christianity and of point miss in demand that we demonstrate things that we only claim to believe as matter of faith crito give each of these technical latin label speak for myself if sophistry be the art or power of deceive other men must acquit these gentlemen of it they seem to have lead me on journey through atheism libertinism fanaticism and fatalism not to convince me of the truth of any of them so much as to confirm me in my own way of think they have display their flimsy war not to cheat but to amuse us know them to be self announce master of ridicule don know what seriously to make of them you don know what to make of us be sorry if you do only superficial philosopher can be quickly fathom create ambiguity about where one stand seem to be the sure way to fame and esteem in the learn world as it now be when an able reader can decide whether his author be atheist or deist or polytheist stoic or epicurean sceptic or dogmatist unbeliever or religious fanatic joke or serious he immediately conclude that the author be enigmatic and deep in fact it true of the most admire writers of our time that no one can tell what to make of them or what they be get at we have among us moles that dig deep under grind and eagle that soar out of sight we can act all part and become all opinions put them on or off with great freedom of wit and humour it seem then that you be pair of inscrutable unfathomable fashionable philosophers that can be deny but remember that you start off with an open dogmatic air talk of plain principles and evident reason and promise to make things as clear as noonday to wipe out wrong notions and plant right ones in their place before long though you begin to back away from your first notions and adopt others you advance one while retract another assert and concede say and unsay and after have follow you through so many untrodden paths and intricate mazes find myself no nearer to understand what you actually think didn we tell you that the gentlemen of our sect be very good at tease but it seem to me to be useless for plain man with some settle beliefs or principles to do battle with such slippery dodge changeable philosophers the rule seem to be the christian man must stand still in one place while his free think adversary choose and change his fight position have full range and liberty to move around the battle field and attack his christian opponent on all side in all shape from close up or with missiles from far away on horseback or on foot in light or heavy armour there no deny that gentleman have great advantage over strait lace pedant or bigot but at the end of it all how be better off from the conversation of two such knowledgeable gentlemen hop to unlearn my errors and to learn truths from you but find to my great disappointment that haven be unteach anything or teach anything it hard to unteach men their prejudice but that have to be do before we can offer to teach them the truth and anyway we don now have time to prove and argue the ensue remark about laws of hospitality confinement in the castle etc be run joke it look like rather thin cover for the anger and contempt that have be build up especially on the christian side well suppose that my mind be white paper and that you be invite to write on it the things that you would teach me if only be teachable don try to wipe out my present opinions or to prove your own for once don joke or tease just let me know some one conclusion of yours before we part if you don ll beg crito to violate the laws of hospitality towards those who have violate the laws of philosophy by hang out false light to someone who be accord to you benight in ignorance and error false light be light place on the sea shore in position that be likely to draw ship onto the rock appeal to you shouldn these philosophical knight errants be confine in this castle of yours until they make reparation euphranor be right say crito and my sentence be that you remain here in prison until you have do something towards satisfy my undertake to euphranor which be that he would know your opinions from yourselves which you also agree to since it must be so will now reveal what take to be the sum and substance the grand arcanum see note on page and final conclusion of our sect can do it in two word and he utter two greek word sentence which mean there be only hypotheses so you re downright sceptic but sceptic as you be you admit that it be probable that there be god certain that the christian religion be useful possible that it be true certain that if it be true the minute philosophers be in bad shape give all this how can there be any question about what course wise man should take whether the principles of christians or unbelievers be truest may be make question but there be no question about which be safest if you have doubt about all opinions you must have doubt about your own which mean that for all you know christianity may be true the more doubt the more room there be for faith because sceptic have less right than anyone else to demand evidence evidentness but whatever uncertainty there may be about some things this much be certain either there be god or there isn either there be revelation or there isn either man be an agent or he isn either the soul be immortal or it isn if the negative be not sure the affirmatives be possible if the negative be improbable the affirmatives be probable the more any of your able men find himself unable to prove any one of these negative the stronger ground he have to suspect he may be mistake so minute philosopher who want to act consistently ought to share with the sceptic not merely the sceptic doubt but also his diffidence his modesty and his timidity he shouldn announce an ocean of light and then lead us to an aby of darkness if that conduct isn ridiculous don know what ridiculous mean as for your ridicule something that may for all you know be true can make any sense of that it isn act as wise man with regard to your own interest or as good man with regard to the interest of your country cicero say somewhere let us either get rid of religion altogether or retain it altogether if there be single instance of people prosper without any religion propose in the british parliament that we change our constitution and live without religion if there be any religion better than christianity propose to the parliament that we introduce that new religion sceptic be member of community just like any other man and he can distinguish good from evil whether natural or political and his knowledge of this distinction should be his guide as patriot even though he isn christian and if he doesn claim to know even this much he should stop claim to correct or alter something that he know nothing about also someone who merely doubt shouldn behave as if he could demonstrate consider someone who say find my country in possession of certain tenets namely those of christianity they appear to do good which be why they be encourage by the legislature they be main part of our constitution and don find that these free think innovators can disprove them or substitute things more useful and certain in their place so shall go along with those tenets out of regard for the good of mankind and for the laws of my country don say that this man be christian but regard him as patriot with something that matter as much as christianity do not to inquire be folly but it be even greater folly to condemn without inquire lysicles seem heartily tire of this conversation it be now late he say to alciphron and everything be ready for our departure everyone have his own way of think and can no more adopt another man way of think than can adopt his complexion and facial feature alciphron plead that they have comply with euphranor condition for be release from the castle and that they should now be set free and euphranor answer that he have no further claim to make all he have want be to know their tenets epilogue after the philosophers have leave remark to crito that it be hard to understand how men who be so easy to confute should be so difficult to convince aristotle explain this say crito he say that arguments don have an effect on everyone but only on those whose mind be prepare by upbringing and habit as land be prepare for seed nichomachean ethics however clear point be the odds be that it win be understand by someone whose habit and cast of mind go against it so weak thing be reason when in competition with inclination reply that this answer might hold with respect to some people at some time but that it didn seem satisfactory when apply to inquire men at time when reason be so much cultivate and think so much in vogue man who be keen social observer say crito have say that these days think be talk of more than it be in ancient time but practise less and that since the revival of learn men have read much and write much but think little so that for us think closely and soundly be tiny part of what learn man do and doesn figure at all in the activities of the socially polish man the free thinkers it must be admit parade themselves as thinkers but don show much exactness in their think lively man and what the world call man of sense be often no good at all at think the ability to think be not mere gift of nature but must be improve and perfect by much attention and exercise on very different subject which mean that it require more time and trouble than today quick off the mark men care to take those be the view of judicious friend of mine if you aren already sufficiently convince of their truth you need only look at the dark confuse admire writers of this famous sect then you ll be able to judge whether those who be lead by men whose head be so wrong can have very good head of their own take for example spinoza the great leader of our modern unbelievers whose write contain many scheme and notions that have be much admire and follow in recent years for example undermine religion under the pretence of vindicate and explain it maintain that it isn necessary to believe in christ accord to the flesh persuade men that miracles be to be understand only in spiritual and allegorical sense that vice be not as bad thing as we be apt to think that men be mere machine impel by fatal necessity remark have hear spinoza describe as man of close argument and demonstration he do indeed demonstrate reply crito but by his standards anyone could demonstrate anything if man be allow the privilege of make his own definitions of common word it will be easy for him to demonstrate conclusions that be true in one sense and false in another true and indeed manifest truisms in his sense but false and indeed seem paradoxes when the word be take in their ordinary sense for example let spinoza define natural right to be natural power and he will easily demonstrate that whatever man can do he have right to do the folly of this procedure be utterly obvious but our free thinkers who claim to have the lumen siccum be so passionately prejudice against religion that they ll accept as demonstrations the grossest nonsense and sophistry of weak and wicked writers lumen siccum be latin for dry light it come from bacon brilliant metaphor the human intellect doesn burn with dry light because what the person want and feel get pump into it and these men make so much noise with their think reason and demonstrate that they prejudice some well mean people against all use and improvement of reason one man saw neighbour of his ruin by the vices of free think son and acquire such prejudice against think that he wouldn let his own son read euclid because he have be tell that it might teach him to think he be rescue from this by friend who convince him that the epidemic be not an outbreak of think but merely an unthinking pretence of think know one eminent free thinker who never go to bed without gallon of wine in his belly and he always replenish it before the fume have leave his brain so that he hasn have one sober think in the past seven years he add two more anecdotes report disgraceful behaviour by free thinkers then it be strange say crito that such men should parade themselves as free thinkers but it even stranger that other men should be on bad term with think and reason because of such pretenders answer that some good men think there be an opposition between reason and religion knowledge and faith nature and grace and be lead by that to conclude that the way to promote religion be to quench the light of nature and to discourage all rational inquiry shan comment on the intentions of these men reply crito but surely their notions be very wrong what could dishonour religion more than represent it as an unreasonable unnatural ignorant institution god be the father of all light natural as well as reveal natural greed be one thing and the natural light be another and you can argue that because one be bad so be the other similarly you can argue that because false knowledge be bad that real knowledge be bad also so whatever be say about one of them in the bible be not to be interpret as have say something about the other insist that human learn in the hand of theologians have from time to time create great dispute and divisions in the church just as abstract metaphysics have always tend to produce dispute among christians as well as other men say crito it should seem that genuine truth and knowledge would calm this mood that make men sacrifice the undisputed duties of peace and charity to disputable notions after all say whatever may be say for reason the sceptics and unbelievers of today win be cure by it win dispute that say crito to cure an illness you should consider what produce it if men have reason themselves into wrong opinion one might hope to reason them out of it but that not how things stand the unbelief of minute philosophers seem to arise from things very different from think and reason people be often turn into unbelievers by little incidents vanity disgust mood inclination without any help from reason face with doctrine whose general tendency one find disagreeable the mind be prepare to enjoy and improve everything that can possibly be think to count against it thus someone reason for his unbelief may be the coarse manners of some country curate the polish manners of great family chaplain the wit of minute philosopher joke song tale vice laziness quarrelsomeness and fashion produce minute philosophers and quite lot of people become minute philosophers through sheer bad temper who can expect such an irrational and capricious thing should yield to reason still it may be worthwhile to argue against such men and expose their fallacies if not for their sake then for the sake of others who might otherwise be sway by them the most general pretext that look like reason be the one that point to the variety of opinions about religion this be rock for lazy and superficial mind to sit on and take rest but more spirit mind with sounder way of think will stand on it and look around examine and compare the differ institutions of religion he will want to know of all these which be the most sublime and rational in its doctrines the most venerable in its mysteries most useful in its command most decent in its worship which create the noblest hop and most worthy view he will consider their rise and progress and try to discover which owe least to human arts or arm which flatter the sense and gross inclinations of men which adorn and improve the most excellent part of our nature which have be propagate in the most wonderful manner which have overcome the greatest difficulties or show the most disinterested not self interest zeal and sincerity in its adherents he will inquire into which square best with nature and history he will consider which savour of the world and which look like wisdom from above he ll be careful to separate human alloy from anything that be divine and over all he will form his judgment like reasonable free thinker but instead of take such rational course one of those hasty sceptics will conclude straight off that there no wisdom in politics no honesty in business no knowledge in philosophy no truth in religion and all by the same sort of inference from premise about the numerous examples of folly knavery ignorance and error that be to be meet with in the world and because people who know nothing about anything think they be sharp sight in religion this learn sophism be oftenest level against christianity in my opinion if you want to convince an unbeliever who can be bring to reason you should start by clearly convince him of the existence of god because it seem to me that real theist can be an enemy to the christian religion and that what basically make someone minute philosopher be his ignorance or disbelief about god existence those who be acquaint with the great author in the minute philosophy presumably don need to be tell this that god exist can be clearly prove and be proper object of human reason whereas the mysteries of his nature and indeed any other mysteries there be in religion can possibly be explain and prove by reason it be sufficient if we show that there nothing absurd or selfcontradictory in our beliefs on those matter and instead of form hypotheses to explain them use our reason only for answer the objections bring against them but we ought always to distinguish the serious modest honest man of sense who have doubt about religion and behave like prudent man in doubt from the minute philosophers those profane and conceited men who insist on try to convert others to their own doubt when someone of this kind present himself we should consider what species he belong to first hand philosopher second hand philosopher libertine scorner sceptic each type require its own special treatment some men be too ignorant to be humble and without humility nothing can be learn but though man can be convince of anything unless he have do some think and consider even the most ignorant and thoughtless can sometimes be laugh out of their opinions once saw bright woman get the better of two minute philosophers by take her cue from their predominant claim about themselves to the one who claim to be the most incredulous man upon earth she remark that for someone who be credulous enough to trust the most valuable things his life and his fortune to his pharmacist and his lawyer it be absurd to claim to be too incredulous to trust his soul mere trifle accord to him to his parish priest to the other nattily dress dandy who say that he favour the most unbounded freedom she remark that he be an absolute slave in matter of dress to him the most important thing in the world while he be earnestly contend for freedom of think which be something he never bother to do there be very few first hand minute philosophers not enough of them to matter in themselves but their followers who pin their faith on them be numerous and be as confident as they be credulous and they do matter because there something in the air and manner of these second hand philosophers that be very apt to disconcert serious man who believe in argument it much harder to put up with than the weight of their objections euphranor suggest that it would be greatly to the public benefit if instead of discourage free think there be erect dianoetic academy think tank or seminary for free thinkers provide with quiet room and galleries and shady walk and groves where after seven years of silence and meditation man might become genuine free thinker and from then on be legally entitle to think what he please and have badge to distinguish him from counterfeit really seriously say crito think that what the present time need most be more think and that the real cause of whatever be wrong can fairly be attribute to the general neglect of education in those who need it most namely the people of fashion what can be expect when those who have the most influence have the least sense and those who be sure to be follow set the worst example when the young be so uneducated and yet be hear from so much when modesty be regard as feebleness and deference to years knowledge religion and laws be regard as lack of sense and spirit he evidently mean that modesty etc be regard etc by the young because he go on such precocious development wouldn have be value or encourage by the wise men of antiquity whose view on this matter be so out of line with the spirit of our time that modern ears afraid couldn bear them what go to say would seem ridiculous to our british youth who be so full of ideas and so boldly in favour of try out new things and set their country to right but think it will be accept by men of sense it be this if today governments would try as an experiment to consider themselves in that old homeric light as pastors of the people whose duty it be to improve their flock they would soon find that this require very different kind of upbringing from the modern one and different maxims from those of the minute philosophy if our youth be really accustom to think and reflection and an acquaintance with the excellent writers of antiquity we see the licentious frame of mind commonly call free think banish from the presence of gentlemen along with ignorance and bad taste and one reform in how the young be bring up need special attention as things be men follow vice for the sake of pleasure and fly from virtue because they hate pain so what be need be for young mind to be form and accustom to receive pleasure and pain from proper object to have their inclinations and aversions point in the right directions anyone who feel the curse effect of wrong upbringing in his mind his health or his fortune should ponder this think there be no better way for you to make amend for what be wrong in yourself than prevent it from be wrong also in your descendants while crito be say this other guests come in which put an end to our conversation
