dialogues concern natural religion david hume content letter from pamphilus to hermippus dialogues concern natural religion david hume dialogues concern natural religion david hume pamphilus to hermippus letter from pamphilus to hermippus it have be remark that though the ancient philosophers mostly teach through dialogues the dialogue form hasnt be much use in recent time and have seldom succeed when people have try it there be a good reason for this philosophical enquirers these days be expect to produce precise and orderly arguments and someone aim at those will naturally proceed with a methodical exposition in which he can right at the outset explain the point he want to establish and then proceed without interruption to present his proof of it it hardly seem natural to present a system in conversation and there be also another disadvantage of the dialogue form by depart from the direct style of composition the dialoguewriter hop to give a freer air to his performance and to avoid the appearance of author and reader but he risk run into something worse convey the image of teacher and pupil and if he avoid that by conduct the dispute in the natural spirit of good company throw in a variety of arguments and preserve a proper balance among the speakers he often spend so much time set things up and move from one line of think to another that the reader will hardly think that the order brevity and precision which have be lose be make up for by all the grace of dialogue there be some subject however for which dialoguewriting be especially suitable and preferable to the direct and simple method of composition i shall describe two of them apart from their suitability for the dialogue form they be utterly unalike though it will turn out that one big topic include both any point of doctrine that be so obvious that it can hardly be question but at the same time so important that it deserve to be teach repeatedly seem to require some such method of handle it in a dialogue the novelty of the manner of presentation may make up for the triteness of the subject and the liveliness of the conversation may reinforce the teach also the variety of different angle from which the character in the dialogue approach the subject may appear neither tedious nor redundant on the other hand any question of philosophy that be so obscure and uncertain that human reason cant reach a secure conclusion about it seem to lead us naturally into the style of dialogue and conversation reasonable men may be allow to differ on a topic regard which noone can reasonably be confident and oppose view even without any decision as to which be right provide an agreeable way of pass the time and if the subject be challenge and interest the dialogue put us in a way into the company of the character in it thus a dialogue can unite the two greatest and purest pleasures of human life study and the company of others fortunately all those feature be to be find in the subject of natural religion what truth be so obvious so certain as that there exist a god people in the most ignorant age have believe this and the most refine geniuses have work to produce new proof and arguments for it and what truth be so important as this it be the grind of all our hop the surest foundation of morality the firmest support of society and the only principle that ought never to be a moment absent from our thoughts and meditations but when we dig into this obvious and important truth we run into obscure question about the nature of that divine be his attribute his decree his plan of providence men have always disagree about these matter and human reason hasnt definitely settle them but these topics be so important that we cant restrain our restless enquiry into them even though our most accurate research have yield nothing but doubt uncertainty and contradiction i recently have a chance to observe thisthat be the suitability of natural religion as a theme for dialoguewhen i be spend part of the summer season with cleanthes as i usually do and be present at the conversations he have with philo and demeathe ones i recently sketch to you my sketch make you so curious to know more you say that i cant forbear to give you a more detail report on their reason and to display the various systems that they defend relate to this delicate subject of natural religion the character of the three men be remarkably different and this raise your expectations even higher you contrast the careful philosophical methods of cleanthes with the casual scepticism of philo and contrast each of those with the rigid inflexible orthodoxy of demea be young i listen but didnt speak and my intense youthful interest in the whole conversation imprint on my memory the whole chain and connection of their arguments i hope and think that my account of the conversation wont omit or muddle any considerable part of it after i join the group whom i find sit in cleanthes library demea pay cleanthes some compliment on the great care he take of my education and on his unwearied perseverance and constancy in all his friendships pamphiluss father he say be your intimate friend the son be your pupil and we might think him to be your adopt son if we judge by the trouble you take in bring to him every useful branch of literature and science i be sure that you be as prudent as you be hardworking so i shall tell you a maxim that i have follow with regard to my own children want to know how far it agree with your upbringing of pamphilus the method i follow in the education of my children be base on the say of an ancient students of philosophy ought first to learn logic then ethics next physics last of all the nature of the gods because this science of natural theology be the most profound and abstruse of any he hold students of it need mature judgment and it cant safely be entrust to a mind that isnt already enrich with all the other sciences in this work science mean something like systematic discipline theoretical treatment it cover more than science do today do you leave it as late as that philo ask to teach your children the principles of religion isnt there a risk that they will neglect or even outright reject those religious view of which they have hear so little during the whole of their education demea reply i postpone the study of natural theology as a science that be open to human reason and controversy but only as a science my chief concern with my children be to bring piety into their mind while they be young by continual teach and also by example i hope i imprint deeply on their young mind a habitual reverence for all the principles of religion while they pass through every other branch of knowledge i comment on the uncertainty of each branch on the eternal controversies of men on the obscurity of all philosophy and on the strange ridiculous conclusions that some of the greatest geniuses have derive from the principles of mere human reason have thus tame their mind to a proper submission and distrust of their own abilities i no longer hesitate to open to them the greatest mysteries of religion and i see no risk that the presumptuous arrogance of philosophy will lead them to reject the most establish doctrines and opinions your precaution of bring piety into your childrens mind early on say philo be certainly very reasonable it be indeed need in this profane and irreligious age but what i admire most in your plan of education be your way of get advantage from the very principles of philosophy and learn which by inspire pride and selfsufficiency have often throughout the centuries be find to be so destructive to the principles of religion they be not so with everyone admittedly common folk with no experience of science and profound enquiry when they see how learn people be endlessly dispute often have a thorough contempt for philosophy and that make them hold even more firmly to the great point of theology that they have be teach people who enter a little way into study and enquiry think they find evidence to support new and extraordinary doctrines come to think that nothing be too difficult for human reason and presumptuously break through all fence and profane the holiest place in the temple our best protection against such arrogance in religious matter be ignorance but after we have abandon that we still haveas i hope cleanthes will agreeone way remain to us to prevent this profane liberty of lay down the law in religious matter what we should do be to adopt improve and cultivate versions of demeas principles concern our proneness to error and confusion let us become thoroughly aware of the weakness blindness and narrowness of human reason pay proper attention to its uncertainty and its endless contradictions even in ordinary everyday subject let the errors and deceits of our sense be keep in mind the insuperable difficulties surround the basic principles of every intellectual system the contradictions involve in the very ideas of matter cause and effect extension space time motionin short all kinds of ideas of quantity of all kinds though quantity be the topic of mathematics the only science that have any claim to certainty or selfevidence when these topics be display in their full light as they be by some philosophers and almost all religious writers who can remain confident enough of his frail reason to give heed to anything it tell him on topics that be so sublime so abstruse and so remote from common life and experience as the existence and nature of god when we realize that really familiar thingslike the holdingtogether of the part of a stone or even the structure of it that make it an extend thingare so inexplicable and involve such contradictions how confidently can we reach conclusions about the origin of worlds or trace their history from eternity to eternity as philo speak i notice that both demea and cleanthes be smile demeas smile seem to express total satisfaction with what philo be say but in cleanthes feature i discern an air of know amusement as though he saw in philos reason some kind of tease or trapsetting you propose then philo say cleanthes to erect religious faith on a basis of philosophical scepticism and you think that if certainty be expel from every other subject of enquiry it will retreat into these theological doctrines where it will be stronger and more authoritative than ever whether your scepticism be as absolute and sincere as you claim be something we shall learn later on when we end this little meet well see then whether you leave the room through the door or the window and whether you really doubt that your body have gravity and can be injure by its fallwhich be what people in general think on the basis of their fallacious sense and more fallacious experience and i think that this consideration of the test of scepticism in everyday life can fairly serve to make us less angry with this whimsical sect of the sceptics if they be wholly sincere they wont trouble the world for much longer with their doubt niggle and dispute and if they be only joke they may perhaps be bad comedians but they can never be very dangerous to the state to philosophy or to religion in reality philo he go on it seem certain that even if a man entirely renounce all beliefs and opinions do this in a rush of blood to the head after intense think about the contradictions and imperfections of human reason he cant persevere in this total scepticism or make it show in his conduct for more than a short time external object will press in on him his passions will call to him his philosophical gloom will dissipate and he wont be able to preserve his poor appearance of scepticismhowever hard he work on himself to do so and what reason have he to work on himself in that way hell never be able to answer that question satisfactorily consistently with his sceptical principles so that on the whole nothing could be more ridiculous than the principles of the ancient pyrrhonians extreme sceptics if they really do tryas it have be claim that they didto apply to the whole of life the same scepticism that they learn from classroom lecture which be where they ought to have confine it from this angle the stoics seem to be very like their perpetual antagonists the pyrrhonians each sect seem to be base on this erroneous maxim what a man can do sometimes and in some moods he can do always and in every mood when stoical reflections raise the mind into a frenzy of virtue and impress it with a sense of some kind of honour or public good extreme bodily pain and suffer wont prevail over such a high sense of duty and it may even be possible for someone to smile and rejoice in the middle of be torture if this sometimes actually happen how much more can a philosopher in his classroom or study work himself up to such a frenzy and imagine himself bear the acutest pain he can conceive but how be he to maintain the frenzy itself his frame of mind relax and he can not brace it up again just by want to do so other activities lead him astray misfortunes attack him unawares and the philosopher gradually sink into be an ordinary person i accept your comparison between the stoics and sceptics reply philo still although the stoic mind cant maintain the highest flight of philosophy even when it sink lower it still retain something of its former disposition and the effect of the stoics reason will appear in his conduct in everyday life flavour all of his action the ancient school of philosophy particularly that of zeno produce examples of virtue and steadfastness which seem astonish to us today vain wisdom all and false philosophy yet with a please sorcery could charm pain for a while or anguish and excite fallacious hope or arm the obdurate breast with stubborn patience as with triple steel milton paradise lose ii similarly if a man have accustom himself to sceptical thoughts about the uncertainty and narrowness of reason he wont entirely forget them when he turn his think onto other subject in all his philosophical principles and reasoningthough i darent say in his everyday conducthe will be find to be different from those who never form any opinions on this topic and from those who have think about it and take a more favourable view of human reason in this paragraph philo use philosophy to mean philosophy or science apparently with his eye mainly on science for ease of read philosophy and its cognates be replace by science and its cognates throughout the paragraph however far anyone push his speculative principles of scepticism he musti admitact and live and talk like other men but the only reason he need to give for this conduct be that it be absolutely necessary for him behave thus if he go further in this direction than he need to for sheer survival and engage in scientific enquiries into various nonhuman and human subject this doesnt show that he be insincere in his scepticism because his reason for this scientific theorize be just that he be draw to it by a certain pleasure and satisfaction that he find in employ himself in that way hes also aware that everyone even in common life be force to conduct himself in greater or lesser degree like a scientist that from our earliest infancy we make continual advance in form more general principles of conduct and reason that as our experience widen and our reason strengthen we make our principles more general and comprehensive and that what we call science be nothing but a more regular and methodical process of the same kind to engage in scientific enquiry into such subject be essentially the same as reason about common life and we may only expect greater stability if not greater truth from our science on account of its more exact and careful method of proceed but when we look beyond human affairs and the properties of the material things around uswhen we carry our speculations into the two eternities before and after the present state of things the creation and formation of the universe the existence and properties of spirit the power and operations of one universal spirit exist without begin and without end omnipotent omniscient unchanging infinite and incomprehensible when we consider any of this we would have to be very unsceptical not to worry that we have here go quite beyond the reach of our faculties so long as we confine our theorize to trade or morals or politics or criticism we make continual appeal to common sense and experience these appeal strengthen our philosophical and scientific conclusions and at least partly remove the suspicion that we rightly have regard any reason that be very subtle and delicate but in theological reason we dont have this advantage of be able to appeal to common experience just when we have most need of it while we be think about object whichwe must be awareare too large for our grasp and need more than any others to be present to our mind in a way that will make them familiar to us we be like foreigners in a strange country to whom everything must seem suspicious and who be in danger every moment of break the laws and customs of the people with whom they live and talk we dont know how far we ought to trust our ordinary vulgar methods of reason in such a theological subject because even in everyday lifein the area that be specially suit to themwe cant explain or justify them and be entirely guide by a kind of instinct or necessity in employ them all sceptics claim that if reason be consider abstractly it provide invincible arguments against itself and that we could never retain any opinion or confidence on any subject if it be not that the sceptical reason in which reason discredit itself be so refine and subtle that they cant outweigh the more solid and more natural arguments derive from the sense and experience but it be obvious that when our arguments lose this advantage of solidity and naturalness and run wide of everyday life the most refine scepticism come to be on an equal foot with them and can oppose and counterbalance them neither side have more weight than the other the mind must remain suspend between them and that suspense or balance be the triumph of scepticism but i observe with regard to you philo and to all theoretical sceptics say cleanthes that your doctrine be at odds with your behaviourjust as much in the most abstruse point of theory as in the conduct of everyday life wherever evidence be find you adhere to it despite your suppose scepticism and i can observe too that some of your fellowsceptics be as decisive as those who claim higher level of certainty and assurance really wouldnt it be ridiculous for someone to say that he reject newtons explanation of the wonderful phenomenon of the rainbow because that explanation give a minute anatomy of the ray of lighta subject say this absurd sceptic too refine for human comprehension and what would you say to someone who find no fault with the arguments of copernicus and galileo for the motion of the earth nevertheless withhold his assent on the general grind that these subject be too magnificent and remote to be explain by the narrow and deceitful reason of mankind there be indeed a kind of crude and ignorant scepticism as you rightly remark that give common people a general prejudice against things they cant easily understand and make them reject every principle that require elaborate reason to prove and establish it this sort of scepticism be fatal to knowledge not to religion for we find that many of those who most strenuously profess it give their assent not only to the great truths of theism and natural theology but even to the most absurd doctrines that traditional superstition have recommend to them they firmly believe in witch though they refuse to believe or attend to the most simple proposition in euclids geometry but the refine and philosophical sceptics fall into an inconsistency of an opposite kind they push their research into the most abstruse corner of science and at every step they accept proposition in proportion to the evidence for them that they meet with they be even oblige to admit that the most abstruse and remote object be the ones that be best explain by science light be in reality anatomize the true system of the heavenly body be discover but the nourishment of body by food be still a mystery that we cant explain the hold together of the part of matter be still incomprehensible light be abstruse and the heavenly body be remote but nourishment and the firmness of pebbles be neither so the refine sceptics can not draw a general line in those term these sceptics therefore be oblige in every enquiry to consider each particular bite of evidence separately and to proportion their assent to the precise strength of the evidence they find this be what they actually do in all natural mathematical moral and political science and why not the same i ask in theological and religious study why should we confine to them the practice of reject conclusions without look into the evidence that have be offer on the general grind that human reason be insufficient isnt this discriminatory attitude a plain proof of prejudice and passion our sense you say be fallacious our understand be erroneous our ideaseven of the most familiar object extension duration motionare full of absurdities and contradictions you defy me to solve the difficulties or reconcile the inconsistencies that you find in them i havent the skill for so great an undertake i havent leisure for it i see that theres no need for it your own conduct in every circumstance refute your principles and show the firmest reliance on all the receive maxims of science morals prudence and behaviour i shall never accept the celebrate arnaulds extravagant statement that the sceptics be not a sect of philosophers only a sect of liars but i will sayno offence meantthat they be a sect of comedians or teasers for my part though whenever i find myself want fun and amusement i shall certainly choose for my entertainment something less puzzle and abstruse than sceptical philosophy a comedy a novel or at most a history seem a more natural recreation than such metaphysical subtleties and abstractions it be no use for the sceptic to distinguish science from common life or one science from another the arguments that he use if they be sound hold good in each of these areas and have just as much force in one as in another or if there be any difference among them the advantage lie entirely on the side of theology and natural religionthe advantage that be of have the strength to resist scepticism many principles of mechanics be base on very abstruse reason yet nobody with any degree of scientific competence claim to be in the least doubt concern to themnor indeed do any theoretical sceptic the copernican system contain the thesis that the sun doesnt go around the earth which be the most surprise paradox and the one most contrary to our natural conceptions to appearances and to our very sense yet even monks and inquisitors have have to withdraw their opposition to it then we have the religious hypothesis which be base on the simplest and most obvious arguments and be easily accept by the mind of man unless it be block by artificial obstacles will philo a thoughtful and knowledgeable man cast doubt on it because of the suppose unreliability of the human faculties in general with no special reference to the religious hypothesis in particular and here we may observe he go on turn towards demea a rather curious fact in the history of the sciences after philosophy be join to the religion of the people when christianity be first establish religious teachers commonly denounce reason the sense and every principle derive merely from human research and enquiry the father of the church take up all the theme of the ancient academics here sceptics which then spread from them down the years into every school and pulpit in christendom the reformers embrace the same principles of reason or rather denunciation and all flowery praise of the excellency of faith be sure to be spice with some cut jib against natural reason a celebrate roman catholic bishop too a man of the most extensive learn who write a demonstration of christianity have also write a book contain all the faultfinding of the boldest and most determine pyrrhonism it take centuries for this contempt for reason to die down locke seem to have be the first christian to risk say openly that faith be nothing but a species of reason that religion be only a branch of philosophy and that the arguments that have always be use in discover all the principles of theology natural and reveal be just like those that have be use to establish truths in morals politics or physics the miserable use that bayle and other freethinkers make of the philosophical scepticism of the church father and first reformersnamely their use of it as a weapon against religionhad the effect of widen the acceptance of lock sensible opinion and now all those who claim to be thinkers assert in a way that atheist and sceptic be almost synonymous and just as it be certain that no man would sincerely declare himself a sceptic i venture to hope that there be as few who seriously maintain atheism dont you remember say philo the excellent say of lord bacon on this topic that a little philosophy reply cleanthes make a man an atheist a great deal convert him to religion thats a very sensible remark too say philo but what i have in mind be another passage where have mention davids fool who say in his heart that there be no god this great philosopher observe that the atheists nowadays be double fool for they arent content to say in their hearts that there be no god but also utter that impiety with their lips which make them guilty of multiply indiscretion and imprudence such people however serious and sincere they be can not be much of a threat i think but even at the risk of your count me as one of this class of fool i cant forbear to say something that occur to me arise out of the history of religious and irreligious scepticism with which you have entertain us it seem to me that there be strong symptoms of priestcraft in that whole course of events during ignorant age such as those follow the abolition of the ancient school the priests saw that atheism deism a thin belief in a higher power not necessarily a personal one or heresy of any kind could only come from the presumptuous question of common opinions and from the belief that human reason be equal to every task in those time education have a great influence over the mind of men and be almost equal in power to the suggestions of the sense and common understand by which the most determine sceptic must admit that he be govern but these days when education have much less influence and mens increase contact throughout the world have teach them to compare the principles that be accept in different nations and age our cunning divine have change their whole system of philosophy and talk the language of stoics platonists and aristotelians not that of pyrrhonians and academics if we distrust human reason we have now no other principle to lead us into religion these reverend gentlemen can be depend on to identify the system that best suit their purpose of keep an ascendancy over mankindit may be scepticism in one age dogmatism in anotherand make it their favourite principle and establish doctrine it be very natural say cleanthes for men to embrace the principles by which they find they can best defend their doctrines we can account for this reasonable behaviour without drag priestcraft into the story and surely nothing can afford a stronger support for the truth of a set of principles than to observe that they tend to confirm true religion and serve to silence the complaints of atheists libertines and freethinkers of all kinds i must admit cleanthes say demea that nothing could surprise me more than the light in which you have all along put this argument by the whole trend and tone of your remark one would think you be maintain the existence of a god against the objections of atheists and infidels and that you felt a need to stand up for that fundamental principle of all religion but i hope there be no question here about the existence of a god i be sure that no manor anyway no man of common senseever have a serious doubt regard such a certain and selfevident truth the question be not about the existence but about the nature of god because of the infirmities of human understand i contend the nature of god be entirely incomprehensible and unknown to us the essence of that supreme mind his attribute his way of exist his way of last through timeall these be mysterious to men as be everything else concern such a divine be finite weak and blind creatures such as we be ought to humble ourselves in his august presence and conscious of our frailties stand in silent wonder at his infinite perfections which eye have not see ear have not hear neither have it enter into the heart of man to conceive they be hide from human curiosity by a deep cloud it be insult to god to try to penetrate these sacred obscurities the audacity of pry into gods nature and essence his decree and attribute be second only to the impiety of deny his existence lest you should think that my piety have here overpower my philosophy i shall support my opinionif it need any supportby a very great authority i could cite in my support almost any writer since the foundation of christianity who have ever treat this or any other theological subject but for now i shall confine myself to just one who be equally famous for piety and philosophy it be father malebranche whom i remember as express himself thus one ought to call god a spirit not so much to express positively what he be as to signify that he be not matter he be an infinitely perfect be this we can not doubt but just as we oughtnt to imagine even suppose him corporeal that he have a human body as the anthropomorphites assert on the ground that the human shape be the most perfect of any so we oughtnt to imagine that the spirit of god have human ideas or bear any resemblance to our spirit on the ground that we know nothing more perfect than a human mind we ought rather to believe that just as he include within himself the perfections of matter without be material he include within himself also the perfections of create spirit without be spirit accord to our conception of spirit we ought to believe that his true name be he that be or in other word be without restriction all be the be infinite and universal after so great an authority as that demea reply philo and a thousand more that you could produce it would appear ridiculous in me to add my own view or express my approval of your doctrine but surely when reasonable men discuss these subject their topic be never the existence of god but only his nature that he exist be as you well observe unquestionable and selfevident nothing exist without a cause and the original cause of this universe whatever it may be we call god and piously ascribe to him every kind of perfection whoever question this fundamental truth deserve every punishment that philosophers can inflict on one another namely the greatest ridicule contempt and disapproval but all perfection be entirely relative so we ought never to imagine that we understand the attribute of this divine be or to suppose that his perfections be in any way analogous or similar to the perfections of a human creature wisdom think design knowledgeit be proper for us to ascribe these to him because those word be honourable among men and we have no other language or other conceptions by which to express our wonder at his glory but let us be careful not to think that our ideas of wisdom think etc in any way correspond to his perfections or that his attribute have any resemblance to these qualities of men he be infinitely superior to our restrict view and limit understand and be more the object of worship in the temple than of debate in the school in reality cleanthes he go on we can arrive at this position without help from the pretendscepticism that you so dislike here be how our ideas reach no further than our experience we have no experience of divine attribute and operations i neednt conclude my syllogism you can draw the inference yourself and it be a pleasure to me and i hope to you too that valid reason and sound piety here work together to the same conclusion and both of them establish the wondrously mysterious and incomprehensible nature of the supreme be i shant beat about the bush say cleanthes address himself to demea still less shall i reply to philos pious speeches what i shall do be to explain briefly how i conceive this matter look round the world contemplate the whole thing and every part of it youll find that it be nothing but one big machine subdivide into an infinite number of smaller ones which in their turn could be subdivide to a degree beyond what human sense and faculties can trace and explain all these various machine and even their most minute part be adjust to each other so precisely that everyone who have ever contemplate them be fill with wonder the intricate fit of mean to end throughout all nature be just like though more wonderful than the fit of mean to end in things that have be produce by usproducts of human design think wisdom and intelligence since the effect resemble each other we be lead to infer by all the rule of analogy that the cause be also alike and that the author of nature be somewhat similar to the mind of man though he have much larger faculties to go with the grandeur of the work he have carry out by this argument a posteriori and by this argument alone do we prove both that there be a god and that he resemble human mind and intelligence i have to tell you cleanthes say demea that from the begin i could not approve of your conclusion about the similarity of god to men still less can i approve of your ways of try to establish it what no demonstration that god exist no abstract arguments no a priori proof an a priori argument be one that proceed by sheer think make no use of contingent facts about what the world be like an argument that do appeal to such facts be call a posteriori which be what cleanthes say that his argument be what about the ones that have in the past be so much insist on by philosophersare they all fallacious all mere trick do experience and probability mark the limit to how far we can go in this subject i wont say that this be betray the cause of a god but surely by this show of evenhandedness you provide atheists with advantage that they could never have obtain purely through argument and reason my main reservation about what cleanthes have say philo remark be not so much that he base all religious arguments on experience as that his arguments seem not to be the most certain and unbreakable even of that inferior experiencebased kind that a stone will fall that fire will burn that the earth have solidity we have observe thousands of time and when any new instance of this sort be present we dont hesitate to draw the usual conclusion this stone will fall this fire will burn the earth that i be about to put my right foot on be solid the exact similarity of the case give us a perfect assurance of a similar outcome and we never want or look for stronger evidence than that but the evidence be less strong when the case be less than perfectly alike any reduction in similarity however tiny bring a correspond reduction in the strength of the evidence and as we move down that scale we may eventually reach a very weak analogy lead to a conclusion that be confessedly liable to error and uncertainty after have observe the circulation of the blood in human creatures we have no doubt that it circulate in titius and maevius but from its circulation in frog and fish it be only a presumptionthough a strong one from analogythat blood circulate in men and other animals the analogical reason be even weaker when we infer the circulation of the sap in plant from our experience that the blood circulate in animals and those who hastily follow that imperfect analogy between plant and animals have be find by more accurate experiment to have be mistake if we see a house cleanthes we conclude with the greatest certainty that it have an architect or builder because this be precisely the kind of effect that we have experience as come from that kind of cause but surely you wont say that the universe be so like a house that we can with the same certainty infer a similar cause or that the analogy be here entire and perfect the unlikeness in this case be so strike that the most you can offer on the basis of it be a guess a conjecture a presumption about a similar cause and i leave it to you to consider how that offer will be receive in the world if i grant that the proof of the existence of a god amount to no more than a guess or conjecture reply cleanthes that wouldnt be well receive and i would deservedly be blame and detest but be it such a slight resemblance between how mean be fit to end in a house and how they be fit in the universe the way things be fit to their purpose the order proportion and arrangement of every part step of a staircase be plainly design so that human legs can use them in climb and this inference from how the step can be use to their purpose be certain and infallible human legs be also design for walk and climb and this inference from how legs can be use to their purpose i admit be not quite so certain because of the dissimilarity you have point out but do that downgrade it to mere presumption or conjecture good god exclaim demea interrupt him what have we come to earnest defenders of religion admit that the proof of a god fall short of be perfectly evident and you philo whose help i depend on in prove the worshipful mysteriousness of gods naturedo you assent to all these extreme opinions of cleanthes for how else can i describe them and why should i tone down my criticism when such principles be advance support by such an authority as cleanthes in the presence of such a young man as pamphilus you seem not to grasp reply philo that i argue with cleanthes in his own way i hope that by show him the dangerous consequences of his view i shall finally bring him to share our opinion but what bother you most i notice be cleanthes account of the argument a posteriori you find that that argument in his version of it be likely to slip out of your grasp and vanish into thin air you think cleanthes have so disguise it that you can hardly believe he have present it properly now however much i may disagree in other ways with the dangerous principles of cleanthes i must admit that he have fairly present that argument and i shall try to set it out for you in such a way that you will no longer view it with suspicion if a man be to set aside everything he know or have see he would be entirely unable to work out merely from his own ideas what the universe must be like or to think one state of affairs to be more likely than another nothing that he clearly conceive could be think to be impossible or to imply a contradiction so every fanciful story his imagination come up with would be on an equal foot with every other and he could give no valid reason for stick to one idea or system and reject the others that be equally possible next step in the argument after he open his eye and see the world as it really be he cant at first tell what the cause be of any one event much less of the totality of things or of the universe he might start his imagination ramble and it might bring in to him an infinite variety of report and stories these would all be possible but because they would all be equally possible he could never from his own resources explain satisfactorily why he prefer one of them to the rest experience alone can point out to him the true cause of anything that happen now demea this method of reason lead to something that cleanthes himself have tacitly admit namely order arrangement or the suitability of things for various purpose like the suitability of legs for walk be not of itself any proof that a designer have be at work except in case where experience have show us that such order arrangement etc be due to a designer for all we can know a priori matter may have a source of order within it just as mind do have it inherently basically not acquire from somewhere else the interpolation in this next bite be longer than most to make it easier to recognize it be flag by asterisk rather than small dot when a number of elements come together in an exquisite arrangement you may think it harder to conceive that they do this of their own accord than to conceive that some designer put them into that arrangement but that be too quick and careless think about what be involve in a designers arrange them it mean that he create the arrangement in his mind assemble in the appropriate way the ideas of the elements in question but then how do that happen i put it to you it be no harder to conceive that the elements be cause to come together into this arrangement by some unknown cause that be internal to them than it be to conceive that the ideas of these elements come together in that arrangement in the great universal mind be cause to do so by a similarly unknown cause that be internal to that mind these two suppositions be agree to be equally possible but accord to cleanthes experience show us a difference between them throw several piece of steel together without shape or form they will never arrange themselves so as to compose a watch stone and mortar and wood without an architect never erect a house but we see that the ideas in a human mind arrange themselves so as to form the plan of a watch or house though we havent the faintest notion of how they do this so experience show that mindsand not matterhave a builtin principle of order from similar effect we infer similar cause the way mean be fit to end in the universe at large be like the way mean be fit to end in a machine design by a human be the cause of the machine therefore must be similar to the cause of the universe i be i admit shock by this assertion of a resemblance between god and human creatures i cant help see it as imply such a lower of the supreme be that no rightthinking theist could put up with it with your assistance therefore demea i shall try to defend what you justly call the worshipful mysteriousness of gods nature and shall refute this reason of cleanthes provide he agree that i have present it fairly when cleanthes have agree to this philo after a short pause proceed in the follow manner in the meantime i shant disagree much with your theses that all inferences concern matter of fact be base on experience and that all experimental reason be base on the supposition that similar cause prove similar effect and similar effect prove similar cause but please notice how extremely cautious good thinkers be in transfer a discover result to a similar case these thinkers be not perfectly confident in apply their past observation to some other particular phenomenon unless the old and new case be exactly similar every alteration in the circumstances of the cause raise a doubt about the outcome and it require new experiment to prove for sure that the new circumstances have no causal significance a change in size position arrangement age disposition of the air or of surround bodiesany of these may bring with it the most unexpected consequences unless the object be quite familiar to us it be much too bold to expect confidently that when a cause have be find to have a certain effect another cause differ from the earlier one in one of these ways will have the same effect the slow and deliberate step of scientists here if anywhere be in contrast with the precipitate march of common men who hurry along by the smallest similarity be incapable of ponder or make distinctions which group cleanthes have you just show yourself to belong to you be usually cool and philosophical in these matter but have your usual attitude be preserve in the stride you have take in liken the universe to house ship furniture and machine infer from their similarity in some respect a similarity in their cause think design intelligence such as we discover in men and other animals be just one of the spring and force of the universe along with heat and cold attraction and repulsion and a hundred others that we observe daily it be an active cause through which we find certain particular part of nature produce alterations in other part but can it be proper to argue from part to the whole doesnt the great disproportion between part and whole bar all comparison and inference from observe the growth of a hair can we learn anything about how men come into be would the way a leaf blowseven if we know this perfectlyteach us anything about how a tree grow anyway even if we do take the operations of one part of nature on another as our basis for a judgment about the origin of the whole which be something we should never do why would we select as our basis such a tiny weak limit cause as the reason and design of animals on this planet seem to be this little agitation of the brain that we call thoughtwhat special privilege do it have that entitle it to serve as the model of the whole universe it loom large for us because we be always in the presence of it but sound philosophy ought carefully to guard against this kind of natural illusion so far from admit continue philo that the operations of a part entitle us to draw any conclusion about the origin of the whole i wont even allow any one part to justify conclusions about another part if the two be very unlike one another be there any reasonable grind to conclude that the inhabitants of other planets have think intelligence reason or anything similar to these faculties that men have when nature have operate in such a wide variety of ways on this small planet can we think that she incessantly copy herself throughout the rest of this immense universe also it seem likely enough that think occur only in this narrow corner and even here its sphere of action be very limitednamely to affect the movements of the body of some animals so what can justify take think to be the original cause of everything such a jump be worse than that of a peasant whose idea of the government of kingdoms be base on how he run his own household but even if we be perfectly sure that think and reason similar to ours be to be find throughout the whole universe and even if its activity elsewhere in the universe be vastly greater in scope and more powerful than it appear to be on this planet still i can not see that the operations of a world that be fully constitute arrange and adjust can properly be extend to a world that be in its embryo state and be still move towards that finish constitution and arrangement by observation we know a certain amount about how a finish animal move be nourish stay alive but we should be cautious about transfer that knowledge speculatively to the growth of a foetus in the womb and still more to the formation of an animalcule in the testes of its male parent animalcule tiny animal it be commonly think that the animal be form in miniature in the father body the mother contribution be merely to provide it with somewhere to grow even our limit experience show us that nature have an infinite number of cause and principles which incessantly reveal themselves as circumstances change it would be absurdly rash of us to claim to know what new and unknown principles would be at work in such a new and unknown situation as that of the formation of a universe a very small part of this great system of the universe during a very short time be very imperfectly reveal to us do we then pronounce confidently about the origin of the whole admirable conclusion at this time on this little planet stone wood brick iron brass be not order or arrange except through human artifice and contrivance therefore the universe couldnt originally attain its order and arrangement without something similar to human artifice but be one part of nature a rule for another part that be very different from it be it a rule for the whole be a very small part a rule for the universe be nature in one situation a certain rule for nature in another situation vastly different from the former be nature at work in our considerably develop universe a certain rule for nature at work in start a universe and can you blame me cleanthes if i here imitate the wise caution of simonides accord to the famous story hiero ask him what be god and simonides ask for a day to think about it and then two days more and in that way he continually prolong his time for think about it without ever produce a definition or description could you even blame me if i answer straight off that i didnt know what god be and be aware that this subject lie vastly beyond the reach of my faculties you might cry sceptic and tease as much as you please but have find the imperfections and even contradictions of human reason when it be exercise on so many other subject that be much more familiar than this one i would never expect any success from reason feeble conjecture concern a subject that be so elevate and so remote from the sphere of our observation when two sort of object have always be observe to be conjoin together custom lead me to infer the existence of an object of one sort wherever i see the existence of an object of the other sort and i call this an argument from experience but it be hard to see how this pattern of argument can be appropriate in our present case where the object we be consider dont fall into sort but be single individual without parallel or specific resemblance and will anyone tell me with a straight face that an orderly universe must arise from some think and artifice like human think and artifice because we have experience of it to make this reason secure we would need to have have experience of the origins of worlds it isnt sufficient surely to have see ship and cities arise from human artifice and contrivance philo be go on in this vigorous manner somewhere between joke and seriousness it seem to me when he notice sign of impatience in cleanthes and immediately stop what i want to cut in with say cleanthes be only the suggestion that you stop abuse term use common everyday expressions to subvert philosophical reason you know that common people often distinguish reason from experience even where the question relate only to a matter of fact and existence though it be find that where that kind of reason be properly analyse it turn out to be nothing but a sort of experience to prove by experience that the universe be originate by a mind be no more contrary to common speech than to prove by experience that the earth move a faultfinder could raise against the copernican system all the objections that you have urge against my reason have you other earth he might say which you have see to move have yes interrupt philo we do have other earth isnt the moon another earth which we see to turn round its centre isnt venus another earth where we see the same thing arent the revolutions of the sun also a confirmation through analogyof the same theory arent all the planets that revolve around the sun earth arent the satellite of jupiter and saturn moon that move around the sun along with their primary planets these analogies and resemblancesand others that i havent mentionedare the only evidence for the copernican system it be for you to consider whether you have any analogies of the same kind to support your theory in reality cleanthes he go on the modern system of astronomy be now so thoroughly accept by all enquirers and have become such an essential a part of the education even of small children that we be often not very scrupulous about examine the reason for it it be now become a matter of mere scholarly curiosity to study the first writers on that subjectthe ones who have the full force of prejudice against them and have to present their arguments in every possible light in order to render them popular and convince but if we peruse galileos famous dialogues concern the system of the world we shall find that that great geniusone of the greatest who ever existedfirst put all his efforts into prove that there be no basis for the distinction commonly make between elementary and celestial substances the aristotelian scientists rely on sensory illusions have make a great deal of this distinction they have lay it down that celestial substances can not be generate alter or in any way affect and they have assign all the opposite qualities to elementary substances but galileo begin with the moon prove its similarity in every detail to the earthits convex shape its natural darkness when not illuminate by the sun its density its distinction into solid and liquid the variations of its phase the mutual illuminations of the earth and moon their mutual eclipse the unevenness of the moon surface and so on after many examples of this kind relate to all the planets men saw that these body be proper object of experience and that their similarity to one another entitle us to extend the same arguments and phenomena from one to another this cautious proceed of the astronomers implicitly condemn your argument cleanthes or rather it point to the fact that the subject on which you be engage exceed all human reason and enquiry can you claim to show any such similarity between the structure of a house and the generation of a universe have you ever see nature in a situation that resemble the first arrangement of the elements at the begin of the universe have worlds ever be form under your eye and have you have leisure to observe the whole progress of worldmaking from the first appearance of order to its final consummation if you have then cite your experience and deliver your theory in the hand of an ingenious and inventive person reply cleanthes even the most absurd argument can be make to seem plausible dont you realize philo that copernicus and his first disciples have to prove the similarity of terrestrial to celestial matter because various scientistsblinded by old systems and support by some empirical evidencehad deny that similarity but that theists dont in the same way have to prove the similarity of the work of nature to those of human artifice because this similarity be selfevident and undeniable the work of nature be make of the same stuff as be human artifacts and the two be alike in form also what more be need to show an analogy between their cause and to show that the origin of all things be a divine purpose and intention your objections to put it bluntly be no better than the elaborate arguments use by the philosophers who deny that anything move and they ought to be refute in the same way as those by illustrations examples and instance rather than by serious argument and philosophy that be how i shall oppose your arguments suppose that an articulate voice be hear in the cloud much louder and more melodious than any human voice could ever be suppose further that this voice be hear at the same time in all nations and that it speak to each nation in its own language and dialect suppose finally that the word speak from the sky be not only meaningful but convey some instruction that be altogether worthy of a benevolent be who be superior to mankind if all that occur could you possibly hesitate for a moment over the cause of this voice wouldnt you be compel to ascribe it straight off to some design or purpose yet if you do come to that conclusion your inference would be open to all the same objections if they deserve such a label that be bring against the system of theism heres the position you seem to be commit to all conclusions about matter of fact be base on experience when we hear an articulate voice in the dark and infer that a man have speak it be only the resemblance of the effect which lead us to conclude that there be a similar resemblance in the cause but this extraordinary voice from the sky be loud and wideranging and flexible as to languages which no human voice be so we have no reason to suppose its cause be like the cause of human speech so this rational wise coherent speech come from we know not whereperhaps an accidental whistle of the windsand not from any divine reason or intelligence you can see clearly your own objections in these objections and i hope you also see clearly that one lot be no better than the other but to bring the case still nearer our present topic of the universe i shall make two suppositions whichthough they be weird and not truedont involve any absurdity or impossibility suppose that there be a natural universal invariable language common to every individual of the human race and that book be natural products which perpetuate themselves in the same way as animals and plant do by descent and propagation these suppositions arent as wildly far from fact as you might think we do have a kind of universal language embed in some expressions of our passions and all the lower animals have a natural speech which however limit be very intelligible to their own species and as the finest and most eloquent text be infinitely less complex and intricate than the coarsest organism the propagation of an iliad or aeneid be easier to suppose than that of any plant or animal well now suppose you enter your library the shelve of which be full of natural volumes contain the most refine reason and most exquisite beauty could you possibly open one of them and doubt that its original cause bore the strongest analogy to mind and intelligence when it reason and discourse when it expostulate argue and enforce its view and line of think when it appeal sometimes to the pure intellect sometimes to the feel when it take up every consideration suit to the subject decorate it and deal with it could you still say that all this basically have no mean and that think and plan have no role to play when this volume first come into be in the loins of its original parent i know you arent as obstinate as that even your irresponsible scepticism would be ashamed to assert such a glare absurdity furthermore philo if there be any difference between my two suppositions case and the real state of affairs in the universe it be the latter that suit my argument better the anatomy of an animal present many stronger instance of design than the read of livy or tacitus do and any objection which you start in the real world case demand that we attend to such an unusual and extraordinary scene as the first formation of worlds hold equally in the two suppositions case with its vegetate library so choose side philo without ambiguity or evasion either assert that a rational book neednt have a rational cause or admit a similar cause for all the work of nature let me add cleanthes go on that this religious argument instead of be weaken by the scepticism that you keep parade be actually strengthen by it become more firm and undisputed to reject all argument and reason be either affectation or madness every reasonable sceptic reject only argumentation that be abstruse remote and intricate stick to common sense and the plain instincts of nature and assent to things the reason for which strike him with so much force that it would take him an enormous effort not to assent now the arguments for natural religion be plainly of this forceful almost irresistible kind and nothing but the most perverse and obstinate metaphysics can reject them think about the anatomy of the eye consider its structure and design and then tell medoesnt the idea of a designer immediately come into your mind with a force like that of a sensation the most obvious conclusion surely be in favour of a designer and it require time reflection and study to bring to mind objectionswhich be frivolous although they be abstrusewhich can support atheism who can see the male and female of each species the fit between their body their instincts their passions and their whole course of life before and after generation without be aware that the propagation of the species be intend by nature millions and millions of such instance present themselves through every part of the universe and the intricate fit of things to their purpose convey an intelligible and obvious mean at least as well as do any language what level of blind dogmatism would you have to reach to reject such natural and convince arguments however you may carp at it the argument that liken an orderly world to a coherent articulate speech will still be accept as an incontestable proof of design and intention in the causation of the world if this argument for theism conflict with the principles of logic as you claim it do its irresistible power over nearly everyone clearly show that there may be arguments that be good although they break the rule dont dismiss this as special plead for we do sometimes accept rulebreaking performances as good even as excellent we sometimes encounter beauties in write that seem contrary to the rule and yet gain our affections and enliven our imaginations in opposition to all the literary doctrines and to the authority of the establish literary master it sometimes happen i admit that the religious arguments dont have the influence they should have on an ignorant savage and barbarian not because they be obscure and difficult but because the savage never ask himself any of the question on which they depend where do the intricate structure of an animal come from from the copulation of its parent and where do the parent come from from their parent repeat this a few time and the object come to be at such a distance from the savage that he lose them in darkness and confusion and he have no curiosity to trace them further but this be neither dogmatism nor scepticism but stupidity a state of mind very different from your closearguing questionraising disposition my ingenious friend you can trace cause from effect you can compare the most distant and remote object and your greatest errors proceed not from barrenness of think and invention but from too luxuriant a fertility which suppress your natural good sense by a profusion of unnecessary doubt and objections here i could observe that philo be a little embarrass and confuse but while he hesitate in give an answer demea break in on the conversationluckily for philo your example involve book and language he say to cleanthes get much of its force from be familiar but isnt there some danger in this very familiarity may it not lead us to get above ourselves by make us imagine we comprehend god and have some adequate idea of his nature and attribute when i read a book i enter into the mind and intention of the author at that moment i become him in a way and have an immediate feel and conception of the ideas that revolve in his imagination when he be write but we can never come as close as that to god his ways be not our ways his attribute be perfect but incomprehensible and his book of nature contain a great and inexplicable riddle more than any intelligible discourse or reason the ancient platonists you know be the most religious and devout of all the pagan philosophers yet many of them particularly plotinus expressly declare that intellect or understand be not to be ascribe to god and that our most perfect worship of him consist not in act of veneration reverence gratitude or love but rather in a certain mysterious selfannihilation or total extinction of all our faculties these ideas be perhaps too far stretch but still there be a truth bury in them it must be admit that by represent god as so intelligible and comprehensible and so similar to a human mind we be guilty of the grossest and most narrow selfcentredness make ourselves the model of the whole universe all the sentiments of the human mindgratitude resentment love friendship approval blame pity imitation envyclearly involve the state and situation of man and be calculate for preserve the existence and promote the activity of be like us in circumstances like ours so it seem unreasonable to transfer such sentiments to a supreme be or to suppose that he be move by them besides which the phenomena of the universe wont support us in such a theory all our ideas derive from the sense be confusedly false and deceptive and so cant be suppose to have a place in a supreme intelligence and the whole stock of the human understand consist of those together with the ideas of the external sense and we cant attribute the latter to god who be in no way passive and so doesnt have sense as we do we may conclude that none of the materials of think in the human intelligence be in any respect like those of the divine intelligence now as to the manner of think how can we make any comparison between them or suppose them to be in any way alike our think be fluctuate uncertain fleet successive and compound make up of little elements of think and these feature of it belong to its essence so that it would be an abuse of word to apply the name of think or reason to anything that wasnt fluctuate uncertain etc at least if it seem more pious and respectful as it really be still to use these word when we speak of the supreme be we should admit that their mean as apply to him be totally incomprehensible and that the weakness of our nature prevent us from have any ideas that correspond in the least to the ineffable sublimity of gods attribute it seem strange to me say cleanthes that you demea who be so sincere in the cause of religion should still maintain the mysterious incomprehensible nature of god and should insist so strenuously that he in no way resemble human creatures i freely admit that god have many power and attribute that we cant comprehend but if our ideas of him be not as far as they go true and adequate and in conformity with his real nature i dont know what remain that be worth discuss in this subject be the name without any mean of such vast importance and how do you mystics who maintain the absolute incomprehensibility of god differ from sceptics or atheists who assert that the first cause of everything be unknown and unintelligible they reject the view that the world be produce by a mind by which i mean a mind like the human one for i dont know of any other kind they must be very bold if they then go on to claim to know what other specific intelligible cause produce the world and if they dont make that claim and admit that the cause be unknown to them they must be very scrupulous indeed if they refuse to call the unknown cause of everything a god or deity and to bestow on him as many highflown praise and meaningless epithets as you may ask them to who could imagine reply demea that cleanthesthe calm philosophical cleantheswould attempt to refute his antagonists by stick a label on them namely the label mystic and like the common bigots and inquisitors of our time resort to invective and rhetoric instead of reason doesnt he realize that his kind of attack can go either way and that anthropomorphite be as damage and threaten a label bring as much danger with it as the epithet mystic with which he have honour me anthropomorphite come from greek mean humanshaped an anthropomorphite be someone who hold that god be like a man in reality cleanthes consider what you be say when you represent god as similar to a human mind and understand what be the mind of man it be make up of many different faculties passions sentiments and ideas they be indeed unite into one self or person but they be still distinct from each other when a man mind reason the ideas that be the part of its mental discourse arrange themselves in a certain form or order and this be not preserve intact for a moment but immediately make way for a new arrangement of ideas new opinions new passions new affections new feel arise which continually diversify the mental scene and produce in it the greatest variety and most rapid succession imaginable how be this compatible with that perfect unchangingness and simplicitysimplicity in the sense of not have partswhich all true theists ascribe to god accord to them he see past present and future in a single act his love and hatred his mercy and justice be one individual operation he be entirely present at every point in space and exist completely at every instant of time gods nature doesnt involve the slightest hint of difference or variation there be no sequence of events in him he doesnt change he doesnt gain or lose anything what he be now be what he have always be and always will be without any change in what he think feel or do he stand fix in one simple perfect state and it can never be correct to say that this act of his be different from that or that this judgment or idea be one that he have only recently and that it will in time be follow by some other judgment or idea i can readily allow say cleanthes that those who maintain that god be perfectly simple in the sense you have give to this and to the extent that you have just express be complete mystics and be guilty of all the consequences that i have derive from their opinion they be in a word atheists without know it for though we may grant that god have attribute that we can not understand still we ought never to ascribe to him any attribute that be absolutely incompatible with the think nature that be essential to him a mind whose act and feel and ideas be not distinct and successive a mind that be wholly simple and totally unchanging be a mind that have no think no reason no will no sentiment no love no hatred in short it isnt a mind at all it be an abuse of word to call it a mind on a par with speak of a region of space that have no shape or of number that isnt compose of smaller number think who your target be say philo you confer the title atheist on almost all the sound orthodox theologians who have treat this subject and you will end up find that by your criteria you be the only sound theist in the world but if idolaters be atheists as i think they can fairly be say to be and if christian theologians be also atheists as you have imply what be leave of the famous argument for theism from the universal consent of mankind but i know that name and authorities dont carry much weight with you so ill try to show you a little more clearly the drawbacks of that anthropomorphism that you have embrace and i shall prove that there be no basis for the view that a plan of the world be form in gods mind consist of distinct ideas differently arrange in the way an architect form in his head the plan of a house that he intend to build it isnt easy to see what be gain by this supposition that god have such a plan whether we steer by reason or by experience you have offer this suppose plan as a satisfactory and conclusive cause of the world but we can not leave it at that for we still have to raise the further question about the cause of this cause look for an answer let us first consult reason then experience if reason i mean abstract reason involve a priori thoughts be not equally silent with regard to all question concern cause and effect it will at least venture to say this much a mental world or universe of ideas stand in as much need of a cause as do a material world or universe of object and if the mental world be similar in its arrangement to the material one their cause must be similar for there be nothing here to give rise to a different conclusion or inference regard one world from what we can conclude regard the other look at abstractly they be entirely alike and any problem concern either of them be equally a problem for the other if we turn to experience compel it to say something on these subject that lie beyond its sphere it reply that it cant see any significant difference between these two kinds of worlds so far as causation be concern it find them to be govern by similar principles and to depend on an equal variety of cause in their operations we have specimens in miniature of both sort of world our mind resemble the one a plant or animal the other so let experience judge from these sample which be within its sphere nothing seem more intricate in its cause than think be because these cause never operate in the same way in two people we never find two people who think exactly alike indeed one person doesnt think in exactly the same way at any two time a difference of age of the disposition of his body of weather of food of company of book of passionsany of these detail and others that be less conspicuous be sufficient to alter the precise machinery of think and cause very different movements and operations in it as far as we can judge plant and animal body be no more intricate in their motion and dont depend on a greater variety or more precise adjustment of spring and force now as well as the question concern the cause of the be whom you suppose to be the author of nature your system of anthropomorphism confront us with another question concern the cause of the mental world that you see as cause the material worldthat be the cause of gods plan how can we satisfy ourselves about that havent we the same reason to see that mental world as cause by another mental world or new force of think but if we stop there refuse to raise the question about the cause of gods plan why do we go as far as gods plan why not stop at the material world how can we satisfy ourselves without go on to infinity not that there be any satisfaction in the infinite sequence of cause of cause of let us remember the story of the indian philosopher and his elephant he think that the earth need something to hold it up and suppose it rest on an elephant which he then suppose rest on a tortoise the story be never more applicable than it be to the present subject switch from a spatial to a causal interpretation of rest on if the material world rest causally on a mental world that be similar to it this mental world must rest on some other and so on without end it would be better therefore never to look beyond the present material world by suppose it to contain within itself the cause of its order we be really take it to be god and the sooner we arrive at that divine be the better when you go one step beyond the system of the familiar world you only stir people up into ask question that cant possibly be answer you may say the different ideas that make up gods plan fall into order of themselves and by their own nature but that have no precise mean if it have a mean i would like to know why it be not equally good sense to say the part of the material world fall into order of themselves and by their own nature can one opinion be intelligible when the other isnt we do indeed have experience of ideas that fall into order of themselves and without any know cause outside them but i be sure we have much more experience of matter that do the samefor example in every case of generation and vegetation where it be beyond our capacities to work out what the cause be in this work generation usually the whole process through which animals have offspring and vegetation the correspond process for plant we have also experience of particular systems of think and of matter that have no orderof think in madness of matter in the decay of dead organisms so why should we think that order be more essential to one than to the other and if order require a cause in both what advantage do your system give us when it take the material universe of object to be cause by a similar mental universe of ideas our first step beyond the material world lead us on for ever so it would be wise of us to limit all our enquiries to the present world without look beyond it we can get no satisfaction from these speculations that so far exceed the narrow limit of human understand as you know cleanthes when the ancient aristotelians be ask about the cause of some phenomenon they usually reply in term of their concepts of faculty or occult quality ask why bread nourish for instance they would say that bread nourish by its nutritive faculty and that senna purge by its purgative faculty but it have turn out that this device be merely a disguise for ignorance and that those philosophers be really sayingthough less openlythe same thing as the sceptics and the plain people say when they candidly admit that they dont know what cause these phenomena well now when we ask what cause order in the ideas of god can you anthropomorphites give any answer except that the cause be a rational faculty and that such be the nature of god if that be acceptable then it be hard to see why it isnt equally acceptable to account for the worlds order in a similar wayappealing to faculties and natures that material things havewithout have recourse to any such think creator as you insist on it be only to say that this be the nature of material object and that they all have an inherent faculty of order and proportion which be merely more learn and elaborate ways of admit ignorance the comparable story about gods plan be no better than this one about the material worldexcept in be closer to the prejudice of common people you have present this argument with great emphasis reply cleanthes apparently not realize how easy it be to answer it when in everyday life i assign a cause for some event philo be it any objection that i cant assign the cause of that cause and answer every new question that may endlessly be raise in read the next bite remember that in hum day philosopher cover scientists as well what philosophers could possibly submit to so rigid a rule philosophers admit that ultimate cause be totally unknown and they be aware that the most refine principles which they use to explain the phenomena be as inexplicable to them as the phenomena themselves be to the common people so there can be no question of their agree that its no use assign a cause unless you also assign the cause of the cause the order and arrangement of nature the intricate adjustment of things to their purpose the plain use and intend purpose of every part and organ of a plant or animalall these announce in the clearest language an intelligent cause or author the heavens and the earth join in the same testimony the whole chorus of nature raise one hymn to the praise of its creator you alone or almost alone disturb this general harmony you start abstruse doubt complaints and objections you ask me what be the cause of this cause i dont know and i dont care i have find a god and with that i stop my enquiry let those who be wiser or more enterprising go further i dont claim to be wiser or more enterprising reply philo and for that very reason i might never have try to go so far especially when im aware that i must eventually settle for the same answer that i mightsaving myself all that troublehave settle for from the begin if i be still to remain in utter ignorance of cause and cant give a full explanation of anything i shall never think it be an advantage to shove off for a moment a difficulty which you admit must immediately come back to me with its full force natural scientists indeed very properly explain particular effect by more general cause even when these general cause themselves be in the end totally inexplicable but surely they never think it satisfactory to explain a particular effect by a particular cause that be no more explicable than the effect itself a system of ideas arrange by itself without a prior design be not a whit more explicable than a material system that attain its order in the same way there be no more difficulty in the latter supposition than in the former but to show you still more inconvenience in your anthropomorphism continue philo please look again at your principles like effect prove like cause this be the basis for every empirical argument and you say that it be also the only basis for the theological argument now it be certain that the more similar the observe effect and the more similar the cause that be infer the stronger be the argument every move away from similarity between the effect or between the cause lower the probability and make the empirical argument less conclusive you cant doubt the principle so you oughtnt to reject its consequences accord to the true system of theism all the new discoveries in astronomy which prove the immense grandeur and magnificence of the work of nature be further arguments for the existence of a god accord to your hypothesis of empirical theism they become objections by move the universe still further from all resemblance to the effect of human skill and contrivance if the argument for genuine theism have force in earlier time how much more force it must have now when the bound of nature be so infinitely enlarge and such a magnificent scene be open to us as evidence of its support in ancient time philo quote in latin from lucretius and cicero then it be still more unreasonable to form our idea of the cause of such an unlimited effect on the basis of our experience of the cause of the narrow products of human design and invention the discoveries by microscopes as they open a new universe in miniature be arguments for theism accord to me whereas to you they be objections to it the further we push our research of this kind the more we be lead to infer that the universal cause of it all be vastly different from mankind and from anything of which we have empirical knowledge and what do you have to say about the discoveries in anatomy chemistry botany those surely be not objections interrupt cleanthes they only reveal new instance of skill and contrivance it be still the image of mind reflect on us from innumerable object add a mind like the human say philo thats the only kind i know reply cleanthes and the more like the better insist philo to be sure say cleanthes now cleanthes say philo pounce with an air of triumph note the consequences first by this method of reason you give up all claim to infinity in any of the attribute of god for as the cause ought to be proportion to the effect and the effectso far as we knowis not infinite what right have we on your theory to ascribe infinity to god you will still have to say that when we remove him so far from similarity to human creatures we give in to the most arbitrary hypothesis and at the same time weaken all proof of his existence secondly your theory give you no reason to ascribe perfection to god even in his capacity as a finite be or to suppose him to be free from every error mistake or incoherence in his activities consider the many inexplicable difficulties in the work of natureillnesses earthquakes flood volcanoes and so on if we think we can prove a priori that the world have a perfect creator all these calamities become unproblematic we can say that they only seem to us to be difficulties because we with our limit intellects cant follow all the infinitely complex detail of which they be a part but accord to your line of argument these difficulties be real indeed they might be emphasize as new instance of the worlds liken to the products of human skill and contrivance you must at least admit that we with our limit knowledge cant possibly tell whether this system contain any great fault or deserve any considerable praise when compare to other possible systems and perhaps even when compare to real ones if the aeneid be read to a peasant could he judge it to absolutely faultless could he even give it proper place in a rank of the products of human intelligencehe who have never see any of the others even if this world be a perfect product we still couldnt be sure whether all the excellences of the work could justly be ascribe to the workman when we survey a ship we may get an exalt idea of the ingenuity of the carpenter who build such a complicate useful and beautiful machine but then we shall be surprise to find that the carpenter be a stupid tradesman who imitate others and follow a trade which have gradually improve down the centuries after multiply trials mistake corrections deliberations and controversies perhaps our world be like that ship it may be that many worlds be botch and bungle throughout an eternity before our present system be build much labour lose many useless trials make and a slow but continue improvement carry on during infinite age in the worldmaking trade in such subject as this who can determine what be truewho indeed can even guess what be probablewhen so many hypotheses can be put forward and even more can be imagine and what shadow of an argument continue philo can you produce from your hypothesis to prove that god be one be a great many men join together to build a house or ship to find and develop a city to create a commonwealth why couldnt several gods combine in design and make a world this would only serve to make divine activities more like human ones by share the work among several gods we can reduce still further the attribute of each one of them we can get rid of the extensive power and knowledge that we have to suppose the one god to possess if there be only onethe extent of power and knowledge which accord to you serve merely to weaken the argument for gods existence and if such foolish vicious creatures as men can often unite in form and carry out one plan think how much more could be do by those gods or semigods whom we may suppose to be quite a lot more perfect than we be to multiply cause without necessity be indeed contrary to true philosophy but that principle doesnt apply to our present case if your theory have already establish that there be one god who have every attribute need for the production of the universe then i admit it would be needle though not absurd to suppose that any other god exist but while we be still confront the question be all these attribute unite in one thing that have them all or be they share out among several independent be what phenomena in nature can we point to as supply the answer when we see a body raise in a scale we be sure that in the opposite scaleeven if we cant see itthere be some counterbalance weight equal to it but we can still question whether that weight be a heap of many distinct body or rather one uniform unite mass for example whether it be a handful of pebbles or a single lump of lead and if the weight need for the counterbalance be very much greater than we have ever see any single body to possess the former supposition become still more probable and natural than the latter as with weight so with creators an intelligent be of such vast power and ability as be necessary to produce the universeor to speak in the language of ancient philosophy so prodigious an animalgoes beyond any analogy with ourselves and indeed go beyond what we can understand furthermore cleanthes men be mortal and renew their species by generation and so do all live creatures the two great sex of male and female say milton animate the world why shouldnt this universal and essential feature of our condition also apply to those numerous and limit gods that i be say you should argue for and that bring us back to the ancient tales about the birth of the gods indeed why not become a perfect anthropomorphite why not assert that god isor that each god iscorporeal have eye a nose mouth ears etc epicurus maintain that no man have ever see reason except in someone of human shape and that therefore the gods must have that shape this inference be deservedly ridicule by cicero but by your standards it be solid and philosophical in a word cleanthes someone who follow your hypothesis can perhaps assert or conjecture that the universe at some time arise from something like design but beyond that he cant make a case for any further detail and be leave to fill in his theology by wildly imagine or guess the rest for all he know the world be very faulty and imperfect by certain higher standards which open the doors to all sort of theologies no one of which he can refute here be just three of them this world be only the first rough attempt of some infant god who afterwards abandon it ashamed of his poor performance it be the work of some dependent inferior god whose superiors hold it up for ridicule it be produce by some god in his old age and nearsenility and ever since his death the world have continue without further guidance activate by the first shove he give to it and the active force that he build into it you rightly give sign of horror demea at these strange suppositions but theseand a thousand more like themare cleanthes suppositions not mine as soon as the attribute of god be suppose to be finite all these suppositions get a foothold speak for myself i cant see that have such a wild and unsettle a system of theology be in any way preferable to have none at allthat be be an atheist i absolutely disown these suppositions exclaim cleanthes but they dont fill me with horror especially when put forward in the casual way in which you throw them off on the contrary they give me pleasure when i see that even when give your imagination completely free rein you dont get rid of the hypothesis of design in the universe but be oblige to rely on it at every turn that concession be what i stick to and i regard it as a sufficient foundation for religion it must be a flimsy build say demea that can be erect on such a shaky foundation while we be uncertain whether there be one god or many whether god or the gods to whom we owe our existence be perfect or imperfect subordinate or supreme dead or alive what trust or confidence can we put in them what devotion or worship can we offer them what veneration or obedience give to them this theory of religion become altogether useless for all the practical purpose of life and even when it be consider merely as a speculative theological theory the uncertainty you attribute to it must render it totally precarious and unsatisfactory to make it still more unsatisfactory say philo ive think of another hypothesis that must seem probable when evaluate in term of the method of reason that cleanthes insist on so much he take the basis for all religion to be this similar effect arise from similar cause but there be another principle of the same kind equally certain and support in the same way by experience namely where several know circumstances be observe to be similar the unknown will also be find similar example if we see the limbs of a human body we conclude that it be accompany by a human head even if we cant see it second example if we see a small part of the sun through a crack in a wall we conclude that if the wall be remove we would see the whole sun in short this type of inference be so obvious and familiar that there can be no doubt as to its soundness now if we survey the universe far as we know it it bear a great resemblance to an animal or organic body and seem to be drive by a source of life and motion like the one that drive organisms a continual circulation of matter in it produce no disorder a continual waste in every part be incessantly repair the different part of the whole system be see to act in harmony with one another and each part of the world or member of an organism in do its proper job operate both for its own preservation and for that of the whole from all this i infer the the world be an animal and that god be the mind of the world drive it and be affect by it you have too much learn cleanthes to be at all surprise by this opinion which as you know be maintain by almost all the theists of antiquity and be the main theology that one find in their discourse and reason for though the ancient philosophers sometimes reason from final cause point to evidence of purpose in the world as if they think the world to be something god make yet their favourite idea seem to have be that the world be gods body which be organize in such a way that it obey his command just as your body be so organize thatfor examplewhen you decide to raise your arm it rise the universe be more like a human body than like the work of human skill and plan so if it be ever appropriate to liken the whole of nature to any facts about us with all our limit it seem that the ancient analogy between the universe and our body be sounder than the modern one between the universe and the things we make the former theory also have many other advantage that recommend it to the ancient theologians here be one important one nothing clash more with all their notions because nothing clash more with common experience than mind without bodythe idea of a purely mental substance which they didnt understand and of which they hadnt observe a single instance throughout all of nature they know mind and body because they felt both they also know an order arrangement organization or internal machinery in both mind and body again because they felt both so it be bind to seem reasonable to transfer this experience of themselves to the universe that be to suppose that neither the divine mind nor the divine body come first and that each of them have an order and arrangement that be naturally inherent in it and inseparable from it so here be a new sort of anthropomorphism cleanthes for you to think about and its a theory that doesnt seem to be open to any great difficulties im sure you be above such theoretical prejudice as to find any more difficulty in suppose an animal body to be order and organize originally of itself or from unknown cause than in suppose a mind to be order in that way so you might think that liken the universe to an animal body doesnt require suppose that be drive by a mind a divine mind but the common prejudice that body and mind ought always to accompany each other ought not to be entirely neglect for it be base on common experience which be the only guide you claim to follow in all these theological enquiries if you say that our limit experience be an inadequate standard by which to form opinions about the unlimited extent of nature then you will be entirely abandon your own hypothesis and will have to adopt our mysticism as you call it and admit that gods nature be absolutely incomprehensible i admit reply cleanthes that this theory have never before occur to me though it be a pretty natural one i cant give an opinion about it until i have have more time to think it over you be very scrupulous indeed say philomore scrupulous than i be if you have present me with a system of yours i wouldnt have be half as cautious and reserve in start objections and difficulties to it however if anything do occur to you please tell us why then reply cleanthes it seem to me that though the world do in many ways resemble an animal body this analogy be also defective in many important respect no organs of sense no seat of think or reason no one precise origin of motion and action in short it seem to be more like a plant than an animal and that weaken your inference to the mind of the world secondly your theory seem to imply the eternity of the world and that thesis i believe can be refute by the strongest reason and probabilities i shall suggest an argument against itone that i think hasnt be insist on by any writer first though we should look at a different and less strong argument for the worlds have have a begin it be argue that the arts and sciences come into existence only recently and so the worlds past be fairly short this inference have some force but perhaps it can be refutedor rather its premise can be undercutby a point concern the nature of human society we continually revolve between ignorance and knowledge between liberty and slavery between riches and poverty so our limit experience doesnt enable us to foretell with confidence what outcomes may or may not be expect ancient learn and history seem to have be in great danger of entirely perish after the influx of the barbarous nations into the roman empire and if these convulsions have continue a little longer or be a little more violent we would probably not have know now what happen in the world a few centuries ago indeed the latin language would have be utterly lose if it werent for the superstition of the popes who preserve a little latin jargon so as to keep their church look ancient and universal with latin lose the western world would have be totally barbarous and so wouldnt have be in a fit state to receive the greek language and learn that come to them after the sack of constantinople when learn and book have be extinguish even the practical arts skills and trade would have fall into considerable decay and it be easy to imagine that in that case fable or tradition might ascribe to those arts a much later origin than they actually have and so by parity of argument we be not entitle to confidence that we arent do the same thing because the record of vastly earlier arts and sciences have be wipe out this common argument against the eternity of the world therefore seem a little precarious but here be what seem to be the basis for a better argument lucullus be the first person who bring cherrytrees from asia to europe yet that tree thrive so well in many european climates that it grow in the woods without be cultivate be it possible that throughout a whole eternity no european ever visit asia and think of transplant such a delicious fruit into his own country if it be once transplant and propagate before the time of lucullus how could it ever afterwards perish empires may rise and fall liberty and slavery succeed alternately ignorance and knowledge give place to each otherbut the cherrytree will still remain in the woods of greece spain and italy and will never be affect by the revolutions of human society it be less than two thousand years since vines be transplant into france though there be no climate in the world more favourable to them it be less than three centuries since horse cow sheep pig dog and corn be first know in america be it possible that during the revolutions of a whole eternity there never arise a columbus who could put europe into communication with that continent we may as well imagine that all men would wear stock for ten thousand years and never have the sense to think of garter to tie them all these seem convince proof that the world be young indeed a mere infant because the argument involve them be base on principles that be more constant and steady than those by which human society be govern and direct it would take a total convulsion of the elements to destroy all the european animals and vegetables that be now to be find on the american continent well what argument have you against such convulsions reply philo strong and almost incontestable evidence can be find over the whole earth that every part of this planet have for centuries be entirely cover with water and even if order be inseparable from matter and inherent in it still matter may be susceptible of many and great revolutions through the endless periods of eternal duration we can see that in the change and collapse of which we have have experience the world have merely pass from one state of order to another and matter cant ever stay in a totally disorder and confuse state still the constant change that occur in every part of the material world seem to suggest that some such general transformations sometimes occur what we see in the part we may infer in the wholeat any rate thats the pattern of argument on which you rest your whole theory and if i have to defend some particular system of this type which i would never do willingly i find none of them more plausible than the theory that ascribe to the world an eternal inherent order force though accompany by great and continual revolutions and alterations this at once solve all the difficulties and if the solution be too lack in detail to be entirely complete and satisfactory it be at least a theory that we must eventually accept whatever more detail system we embrace how could things have be as they be if there be not an original inherent principle of order somewherein think or in matter it doesnt matter in the slightest which of thesethought or matterwe prefer no hypothesis whether sceptical or religious should make room for chance everything be surely govern by steady inviolable laws and if the inmost essence of things be lay open to us we would then discover a scene of which at present we can have no idea instead of wonder at the order of natural things we would see clearly that it be absolutely impossible for their order to be differenteven in some tiny detailfrom what it be in actuality if anyone want to revive the ancient pagan theology which maintain as we learn from hesiod that this planet be govern by gods who arise from the unknown power of nature you would naturally object cleanthes that nothing be gain by this hypothesis and that its as easy to suppose all men and animalsmore numerous but less perfectto have spring immediately from a source of that kind push the same inference a step further and you will find that a large society of gods be no harder to explain than one universal god who contain within himself the power and perfections of the whole society so you must allow that all these systemsscepticism polytheism and theismare on an equal foot when judge by your principles that show you that your principles be wrong in think about the ancient system of god as the mind of the world philo continue i have just be strike by a new idea if it be right it come close to subvert all your reason and destroy even the first inferences in which you place such confidence if the universe resemble animal body and plant more than it do the work of human skill it be more probable that its cause resemble the cause of the former than the cause of the latter so its origin ought to be ascribe to generation or vegetation rather than to reason or design so your conclusion be lame and defective even accord to your own principles please expand this argument a little say demea for i havent properly grasp it in the concise form in which you have express it our friend cleanthes reply philo as you have hear assert that since no question of fact can be answer except through experience the existence of a god can not be prove in any other way the world he say resemble things make by human skill so its cause must also resemble the cause of human artifacts i note in pass that the operation of one very small part of nature namely man on another very small part namely the inanimate matter lie within his reach be the basis on which cleanthes judge of the origin of the whole of nature he measure the vast whole by the same individual standard as he do the tiny part but i shant press that point if we be go to argue from part to the whole let us at least be careful about what part we select for this special treatment i affirm that some part of the universe other than the machine of human invention be still more like the fabric of the world than machine be and therefore point to a better conjecture about the origin of this whole system of the universe these part be animals and plant the world plainly resemble an animal or a plant more than it do a watch or a knittingloom its cause be therefore more likely to resemble the cause of the former than to resemble the cause of the latter the cause of the former be generation or vegetation so we can conclude that the cause of the world be something similar or analogous to generation or vegetation but how be it conceivable say demea that the world can arise from anything similar to vegetation or generation very easily reply philo here be one way it could happen just as a tree shed its seed into the neighbour field and produce other tree so the great plant the world or this planetary system produce within itself certain seed which it scatter into the surround chaos in which they grow into new worlds a comet for instance be the seed of a world and after it have be fully ripen by pass from sun to sun and star to star it be at last toss into the unformed elements which everywhere surround this universe and immediately sprout up into a new system or we might suppose this world to be an animal there be no advantage in this but let try it just for variety so a comet be the egg of this animal and just as an ostrich lay its egg in the sand where the egg hatch without any further care and produce a new animal so i understand you interrupt demea but what wild arbitrary suppositions be these what data have you for such extraordinary conclusions be the slight imaginary resemblance of the world to a plant or an animal sufficient to support conclusions about the world base on what happen with plant or animals ought object that be in general so widely different be take as a standard for each other right exclaim philo that be what i have be insist on all along i have go on assert that we have no data to establish any system of cosmogony theory system or story about the origin of the world our experience which be so imperfect in itself and which cover such small stretch of space and time cant give us any probable conjecture concern the whole of things but if we have to settle for some hypothesis tell me what rule we can use to make our choice be there any rule except the one that base the greater acceptability of an hypothesis on the greater similarity of the object compare and doesnt a plant or an animal that arise from vegetation or generation resemble the world more closely than do any artificial machine that arise from reason and design but what be this vegetation and generation of which you talk say demea can you explain how they work and lay out the detail of that fine internal structure on which they depend i can do that reply philo at least as well as cleanthes can explain how reason work or lay out in detail the internal structure on which it depend but i dont need to go into all that it be enough that when i see an animal i infer that it arise from generation and be as sure of this as you be when you infer that a house arise from design the word generation and reason serve merely to label certain power and energies in nature we know the effect of these power but have no grasp of their essence and neither of them have a better claim that the other to be make a standard for the whole of nature in fact demea we can reasonably expect that the wider the range of facts that we take in the better they will guide us in our conclusions about such extraordinary and magnificent subject in this little corner of the world alone there be four principles here drive force or source of energy reason instinct generation vegetation that be similar to each other and be the cause of similar effect how many other principles can we naturally suppose to be at work in the immense extent and variety of the universeprinciples that we might discover if we could travel from planet to planet and from system to system so to examine each part of this mighty structure any one of the above four principles and a hundred others which lie open if not to our sense then at least to our conjecture can give us a theory about the origin of the world and to confine our view entirely to the one of the four that govern how our own mind operatenamely reasonis to be guilty of gross bias if reason be more intelligible to us than the other three principles because it govern our mind there would be some excuse for our bias in its favour but that isnt how things stand because the internal structure of reason be really as little know to us as be the structure of instinct and vegetation even that vague indeterminate word nature which common people drag in to explain everything stand for something that be basically no more inexplicable than reason our experience show us the effect of these principles but the principles themselves and their ways of work be totally unknown to us to say the world arise by vegetation from a seed shed by another world be not less intelligible or less in harmony with experience than to say the world arise from a divine reason or plan take this in the sense in which cleanthes understand it but if the world do have a vegetative quality say demea and could sow the seed of new worlds into the infinite chaos i would see this power as a further argument for design in its author for where could such a wonderful power come from if not from design how can order spring from anything which doesnt perceive the order which it give you need only look around you reply philo to get the answer to this question a tree give order and organization to the tree that arise from it without know that order similarly with an animal and its offspring a bird and its nest there be in the world more examples of this kind than there be instance of order arise from reason and plan to say that all this order in animals and plant proceed ultimately from design be to assume the very point that be at issue the only way to settle the point in favour of design would be to prove a priori both that order be from its own nature inseparably attach to think and that order be prevent from belong to matter either by its own nature or by some unknown basic principle furthermore demea the objection you have just bring cant be make by cleanthes unless he give up a defence that he use against one of my objections when i ask about the cause of that supreme reason and intelligence from which he derive everything else cleanthes say this the impossibility of answer such question be never a legitimate objection in any kind of philosophy we must stop somewhere and wherever we stop more question can be raise because humans will never be able to explain ultimate cause or to show the absolutely basic connections between things all that should be demand be that whatever step we do take be support by experience and observation now it cant be deny that order in nature be find by experience to come from vegetation and generation as well as from reason it be for me to choose whether to base my system of cosmogony on the former rather than on the latter the choice seem entirely arbitrary and when cleanthes ask me what the cause be of my vegetative or generative faculty i be equally entitle to ask him what cause his reason principle we have agree to pass up these question on both side and in our present context it be in his interest to stick to this agreement judge by our limit and imperfect experience generation have some privilege over reason for we see every day reason arise from generationfor example my reason which have in its causal ancestry my parent beget of mebut never see generation arise from reason please compare the consequences on both side the world i say resemble an animal so it be an animal so it arise from generation the step in that argument be jump i admit but each of them involve some small appearance of analogy between world and animal the world say cleanthes resemble a machine so it be a machine so it arise from design these step be jump too and here the analogybetween world and machineis less strike and if he claim to push one step further than my hypothesis by infer that design or reason cause the great principle of generation which i have emphasize i have a better right to push one step further than his hypothesis by infer that a divine generation or godbirth cause his principle of reason i have empirical evidence on my side because reason be observe in countless case to arise from generation and never to arise from any other source this be admittedly only a faint shadow of evidence for my hypothesis but on this topic faint shadow be the best we can do the ancient mythologists be so strike with this analogy that they all explain the origin of nature in term of birth and copulation plato too so far as he be intelligible seem to have adopt some such notion in his timaeus the brahmins assert that the world arise from an infinitely large spider who spin this whole complicate mass from his bowels and then annihilate all or some of it by absorb it again and take it into his own essence here be a kind of cosmogony that strike us as ridiculous because a spider be a negligible little animal whose do we be never likely to take for a model of the whole universe still even for us on our planet this be a new kind of analogy for us to think about if there be as there well might be a planet wholly inhabit by spiders this inference would seem there as natural and secure against criticism as the one that here ascribe the origin of all things to design and intelligence as explain by cleanthes he will find it hard to give a satisfactory reason why an orderly system might not be spin from the belly as well as from the brain i must say philo reply cleanthes that the task you have undertake of raise doubt and objections suit you better than it do anyone else alive it seem in a way natural and unavoidable to you you be so fertile in your inventions that i be not ashamed to admit that i cant straight off solve in a discipline way such outoftheway difficulties as you keep launch at me though i can clearly see in a general way that they be wrong i have no doubt that you be at present in the same position as i be not have any solution as ready to hand as the objection and you must be aware that common sense and reason be entirely against you and that whimsical hypotheses like the ones you have produce may puzzle us but can never convince us what you ascribe to the fertility of my invention reply philo come purely from the nature of the subject in topics that be suit to our limit human reason there be often only one view that carry probability or conviction with it and to a man of sound judgment all other suppositions appear entirely absurd and fanciful but in question like our present one a hundred mutually contradictory view can get some kind of support because each preserve a kind of imperfect analogy so here with all those contenders and no clear winner invention have full scope to exert itself i believe that i could in an instant and with no great effort of think propose still further systems of cosmogony that would have some faint appearance of truth though the odds be a thousandindeed a millionto one against any of them or yours be the true system for instance what if i should revive the old epicurean hypothesis this be commonly and i think rightly regard as the most absurd system ever yet propose but i suspect that with a few alterations it might be give a faint appearance of probability instead of suppose matter to be infinite as epicurus do let us suppose it to be finite and also suppose space to be finite while still suppose time to be infinite a finite number of particles in a finite space can have only a finite number of transpositions and in an infinitely long period of time every possible order or position of particles must occur an infinite number of time so this world with all its events right down to the tiniest detail have already be produce and destroy and will again be produce and destroy an unlimited number of time noone who properly grasp the difference between infinite and finite will have any trouble with this conclusion but this presuppose say demea that matter can come to move without any voluntary agent or first mover without any agent that cause the motion by will or decide that it shall occur and wheres the difficulty in that reply philo in advance of experience every outcome be as hard to credit and as incomprehensible as every other and after experience every outcome be as easy to believe and as intelligible as every other matter often start to move through gravity through elasticity through electricity without any know voluntary agent and to suppose that in all these case there be an unknown voluntary agent be merely to put forward an hypothesisand one that have no advantage that unaided matter should put itself into motion be as conceivable a priori as that it should be put into motion by mind and intelligence besides why cant motion have be pass from object to object by impact and the same or nearly the same stock of it go on be maintain in the universe the motion lose in one process be gain in the opposite process hume write as much be lose by the composition of motion as much be gain by its resolution and whatever the cause of it be the fact be certain that matter be and always have be in continual agitation as far as human experience or tradition reach in the whole universe right now there be probably not one particle of matter at absolute rest philo go on and this very consideration that we have stumble on in the course of the argument suggest yet another hypothesis of cosmogony that isnt entirely absurd and improbable be there a system an order an arrangement of things through which matter can preserve the perpetual agitation that seem essential to it and yet maintain a constancy in the form it produce philo may be use form to refer to any regularly order part of the physical world but he be evidently think mainly of organisms especially animals yes there certainly be such an arrangement for this be actually the case with the present world in which matter be constantly move and yet many form and structure remain the same if matter move continually and have only a finite number of order into which it can fall assume that matter and space be both finite it must eventually produce this arrangement or order that the world actually have and by its very nature this order once it be establish support itself for many age if not to eternity but wherever matter be poise arrange and adjust in such a way as to continue in perpetual motion and yet preserve a constancy in the form the state of affairs be bind to have the very same appearance of plan and skill that we observe at present every part of each form must be relate to each other part of it and to the whole form and the whole form itself must be relate to the other part of the universeto the element in which the form subsist to the materials with which it repair its waste and decay and to every other form which be hostile or friendly towards it a defect in any of those respectsas when arteries fail to carry blood to the brain or a trout become unable to get oxygen out of the water it swim in or a heron become unable to escape hawk or to capture fishdestroys the form and the matter of which it be compose be again set loose and be throw into irregular motion and fermentations until it unite itself to some other regular form for example by be eat if no such form be prepare to receive it and if there be a great quantity of this corrupt matter in the universe the universe itself come to be entirely disorder and this hold true whether what be destroy be the feeble embryo of a world in its first beginnings or the rotten carcass of a world drift into old age and infirmity in either case a chaos ensue until through countlessly though not infinitely many rearrangements there come to be yet again some form whose part and organs be so adjust that they enable the form to stay in existence while the matter in them continually change i shall try to put all this differently suppose that matter be throw into some position by a blind unguided force it be obvious that this first position must in all probability be utterly confuse and disorderly with no resemblance to the human artifacts which display along with a symmetry of part an adjustment of mean to end and a tendency to selfpreservation if the original actuate force cease after this first operation and stop impart motion to matter matter will have to remain for ever in disorder and continue to be an immense chaos without any proportion or activity but suppose that the actuate force whatever it may be still continue to drive matter along this first position will immediately give place to a second which will likewise in all probability be as disorderly as the first and so on through many series of change and revolutions no particular order or position ever stay unaltered for a moment the original force still at work give a perpetual restlessness to matter every possible state of affairs be produce and instantly destroy if a glimpse or dawn of order appear for a moment it be instantly hurry away reduce to a confusion by that neverceasing force which drive every part of the material world thus the universe go on for many age in a continuous series of state of chaos and disorder but couldnt it happen that it eventually settle down not so as to lose its motion and active force for we be assume that that be inherent in it but so as to preserve a uniformity of appearance through all the hubbub of its move part this be what we find to be the actual state of the universe at present every individual be perpetually change and so be every part of every individual and yet the whole appear to be the same a tiny example a rabbit take in pure air and breathe out foul air it drink water and emit urine it eat grass and extrude faeces and yet through all this change in its constituent matter it appear to us as the very same rabbit isnt this state of affairs one that might be hop forindeed one that would be sure to ariseout of the eternal revolutions of unguided matter and couldnt this account for all the appearances of wisdom and plan that the universe contain think about this a little and youll find that if matter do arrive at this setup in which form seem to be stable while their part be really move and change with them that would provide a plausible and perhaps a true solution of the problem of explain the appearance of design in the universe so its pointless to stress the use of the part in animals or plant and their intricate interplay between the part id like to know how an animal could survive if its part be not so interrelate when an animals part lose those interrelations dont we find that it immediately die and that its decay flesh and blood try some new form it happen indeed that the part of the world be so well adjust to one another that some regular form immediately lay claim to this decay matter if that didnt happen could the biological world continue to exist wouldnt it die along with the individual animal and its constituent matter go through new position and relationships untilafter a vast but finite series of changesit fall at last into an order such as the one we actually have it be just as well reply cleanthes that you tell us that this hypothesis come to you suddenly in the course of the argument if you have take the time to examine it you would soon have see the insuperable objections that it be open to you say that no form can survive unless it have the power and organs need for survival some new order or arrangement must be try and another and another and so on without interruption until at last some order that can support and maintain itself happen to come into existence but accord to this hypothesis what bring about the many conveniences and advantage that men and all animals have two eye two ears arent absolutely necessary for the survival of the species the human race could have exist and continue without there be any horse dog cow sheep and those innumerable fruit and products which bring us satisfaction and enjoyment if no camels have be create for the use of man in the sandy desert of africa and arabia would the world have be dissolve if no magnet have be form so as to give that wonderful and useful direction to the compassneedle would human society and the human species have be immediately extinguish the rule by which nature work be in general far from lavish but still instance of this kind be far from be rare and any one of them be a sufficient proof that a designa benevolent designgave rise to the order and arrangement of the universe at least you can safely conclude say philo that the hypothesis i put forward be not yet complete and perfect and i readily admit that but can we ever reasonably expect greater success in any attempt of this nature can we ever hope to construct a system of cosmogony that will be free of exceptions and in no way conflict with our limit and imperfect experience of the analogy of nature your own theory surely cant claim to be as good as that even though you have embrace anthropomorphism so as to improve the theorys conformity to common experience let us try it out yet again in all instance that we have ever encounter ideas be copy from real object you reverse this order and make think come first in all instance that we have ever encounter think have no influence on matter except where that matter be so conjoin with think as to have an equal reciprocal influence on it all that an animal can move immediately be part of its own body and the condition of those can in return affect the animals mental state and indeed the equality of action and reaction seem to be a universal law of nature your theory imply a contradiction to this experience it would be easy to assemble plenty more such difficulties especially in the supposition of a mind or system of think that be eternal in other word an animal that be never bear and will never die these instance can teach us all to be moderate in our criticisms of each other and let us see that just as no system of this kind ought ever to be accept on the basis of a slight analogy so none should be reject on account of a small incongruity for that be a drawback from which we can reasonably hold no system of cosmogony be exempt every religious system be hold by many people to be subject to great and insuperable difficulties each disputant have his period of triumph while he carry on an offensive war and expose the absurdities barbarities and pernicious doctrines of his antagonist but religious systems take all together provide the sceptic with a complete and permanent triumph for he tell the disputants that no system of cosmogony ought ever to be accept for the simple reason that no system of anything ought ever to be accept if it be absurd a total suspension of judgment be here our only reasonable resource and give that we commonly see that among theologians every attack succeed and every defence fail how complete a victory must come to someone who remain always on the offensive against all mankind and have himself no fix position or abide city that he be ever oblige to defend but if there be so many difficulties in the a posteriori argument say demea hadnt we better stay with the simple and sublime a priori argument which cut off all doubt and difficulty with a single blow by offer to us an infallible knockdown proof furthermore this argument let us prove the infinity of gods attributesthat he be infinitely wise infinitely good infinitely powerful and so onwhich i be afraid can never be establish with certainty in any other manner for how can an infinite cause be infer from an effect that be finite or that may be finite for all we know to the contrary the unity of gods nature also be very hardif not absolutely impossibleto infer merely from observe the work of nature even if it be grant that the plan of the universe be all of a piece that isnt enough to ensure us of gods unity whereas the a priori argument cleanthes interrupt you seem to reason demea as if those advantage and conveniences in the abstract a priori argument be full proof of its soundness but in my opinion we should first settle what argument with all these advantage you choose to insist on and then we can try to decide what value to put on itdoing this better by look at the argument itself than by consider its useful consequences the argument that i would insist on reply demea be the common one whatever exist must have a cause or reason for its existence as it be absolutely impossible for anything to produce itself or be the cause of its own existence in work back therefore from effect to cause we must either go on trace cause to infinity without any ultimate cause at all or at last have recourse to some ultimate cause that be necessarily existent and therefore doesnt need an external cause supposition be absurd as i now prove in the suppose infinite chain or series of cause and effect each single effect be make to exist by the power and efficacy of the cause that immediately precede it but the whole eternal chain or series consider as a whole be not cause by anything and yet it obviously require a cause or reason as much as any particular thing that begin to exist in time we be entitle to ask why this particular series of cause exist from eternity and not some other series or no series at all if there be no necessarily existent be all the suppositions we can make about this be equally possible and there be no more absurdity in nothings have exist from eternity than there be in the series of cause that constitute the universe what be it then that make something exist rather than nothing and give existence to one particular possibility as against any of the others external cause we be suppose that there arent any chance thats a word without a mean be it nothing but that can never produce anything so we must adopt supposition and have recourse to a necessarily existent be who carry the reason of his existence in himself and can not be suppose not to exist without an express contradiction so there be such a be that be there be a god i know that philo love raise objections say cleanthes but i shant leave it to him to point out the weakness of your metaphysical reason your argument seem to me so obviously illgrounded and even if it succeed to offer so little help to the cause of true piety and religion that i shall myself venture to show what be wrong with it i start by remark that there be an evident absurdity in claim to demonstrateor to prove by any a priori argumentsany matter of fact nothing be demonstrable unless its contrary imply a contradiction nothing that be distinctly conceivable imply a contradiction whatever we conceive as existent we can also conceive as nonexistent so there be no be whose nonexistence imply a contradiction so there be no be whose existence be demonstrable i offer this argument as entirely decisive and be will to rest the whole controversy on it you claim that god be a necessarily existent be and the friends of your line of argument try to explain this necessity of his existence by say that if we know his whole essence or nature we would perceive it to be as impossible for him not to exist as for twice two not to be four but obviously this can never happen while our faculties remain the same as they be now it will always be possible for us at any time to conceive the nonexistence of something we formerly conceive to exist the mind can never have to suppose some object to remain always in existence in the way in which we always have to conceive twice two to be four so the word necessary existence have no meaningor the same thing no mean that be consistent furthermore if we do go along with this claim explanation of necessary existence why shouldnt the material universe be the necessarily existent be we dare not claim to know all the qualities of matter and for all we can tell matter may have some qualities which if we know them would make matter nonexistence appear as great a contradiction as twice twos be five i have find only one argument try to prove that the material world be not the necessarily existent be and this argument be derive from the contingency both of the matter and the form of the world any particle of matter dr clarke have say can be conceive to be annihilate and any form can be conceive to be alter such an annihilation or alteration therefore be not impossible but it seem very bias not to see that the same argument apply just as well to god so far as we have any conception of him and that our mind can at least imagine god to be nonexistent or his attribute to be alter if something be to make his nonexistence appear impossible or his attribute unalterable it must be some qualities of his that we dont know and cant conceive but then no reason can be give why these qualities may not belong to matter as they be altogether unknown and inconceivable they can never be prove incompatible with the nature of matter as we know it a further objection in trace an eternal series of items it seem absurd to ask for a general cause or first author of the entire series how can something that exist from eternity have a cause since the causal relation imply priority in time and a begin of existence also in such a chain or series of items each part be cause by the part that precede it and cause the one that follow so where be the difficulty but the whole need a cause you say i answer that the unite of these part into a whole like the unite of several distinct counties into one kingdom or several distinct members into one organic body be perform merely by an arbitrary act of the mind and have no influence on the nature of things if i show you the particular cause of each individual in a collection of twenty particles of matter i would think it very unreasonable if you then ask me what be the cause of the whole twenty the cause of the whole be sufficiently explain by explain the cause of the part your reason cleanthes may well excuse me from raise any further difficulties say philo but i cant resist bring up another point arithmeticians have note that every product of have integers which add up to or to some lesser product of thus of and which be products of you make by add to to and to thus be a product also of and if you add and you make which be a lesser product of to a superficial observer this splendid regularity may be wonder at as the effect either of chance or design but a skillful algebraist immediately conclude it to be the work of necessity and demonstrate that it must forever result from the nature of these number isnt it probable i now ask that the whole way the universe work depend on this sort of necessity though no human algebra can provide a key that solve the difficulty instead of wonder at the order of natural be mightnt it be that if we could penetrate into the intimate nature of body we would clearly see why it be absolutely impossible for them to be interrelate in any other way so you run a great risk when you introduce this idea of necessity into the present question because it naturally support an inference that be directly opposite to the religious hypothesis anyway continue philo drop all these abstractions and stay with more familiar topics i venture to remark that the a priori argument have seldom be find very convince except to people with metaphysical mind who have accustom themselves to abstract reason and who have develop bad intellectual habit because find in mathematics that the understand frequently lead through darkness to truths that at first didnt appear to be true they have transfer the same habit of think to subject where it isnt appropriate other people even ones who have good sense and strong inclinations in favour of religion always feel that there be something wrong with such arguments as the a priori argument for the existence of god even though they may not be able to explain distinctly what the defect be which be a certain proof that men always do and always will derive their religion from source other than this sort of reason it be my opinion i admit reply demea that each man somehow feel in his heart the truth of religion and that what lead him to seek protection from god the be on whom he and all nature depend be not any reason but rather his consciousness of his own weakness and misery even the best scenes of life be so trouble or so unpleasant that all our hop and fear look to the future we incessantly look forward and try through prayers adoration and sacrifice to appease those unknown power who we find by experience can so thoroughly afflict and oppress us wretched creatures that we be what help would there be for us amid the innumerable ills of life if religion didnt suggest some ways of reconcile ourselves with god and soothe the terrors with which we be incessantly agitate and torment i be indeed convince say philo that the best and indeed the only method of bring everyone to a proper sense of religion be by make them see clearly the misery and wickedness of men and for that purpose a talent for eloquence and strong imagery be more need than a talent for reason and argument what need be there to prove something that everyone feel within himself it be only necessary to make us feel it if possible more strongly and intimately indeed reply demea the people be sufficiently convince of this great and melancholy truth these phrase the miseries of life the unhappiness of man the general corruptions of our nature the unsatisfactory enjoyment of pleasures riches honour have become almost proverbial in all languages and who can doubt something that all men declare from their own immediate feel and experience on this point say philo the learn be in perfect agreement with the common people and in all literature religious and otherwise the topic of human misery have be stress with the most pathetic eloquence that sorrow and melancholy could inspire the work of the poetswhose testimony have extra authority because they speak from feel without a systemabound in image of this sort from homer down to dr edward young the whole inspire tribe of poets have always be aware that if they be to present human life in a way that fit what each individual person see and feel it as be like they will have to represent it in that way as for authorities reply demea you neednt hunt for them look around this library of cleanthes i venture to guess thatexcept for author of particular sciences such as chemistry or botany who have no occasion to treat of human lifealmost every one of those innumerable writers have somewhere or other be lead by his sense of human misery to testify to it and complain of it at any rate the odds be that almost all of them have write in that way and as far as i can remember no author have go to the opposite extreme of deny human misery there you must excuse me say philo leibniz have deny it he be perhaps the first who venture on such a bold and paradoxical opinion or anyway the first who make it essential to his philosophical system give that he be the first reply demea mightnt that very fact have make him realize that he be wrong for be this a subject on which philosophers can claim to make discoveries especially as late in history as this and can any man hope by a simple denial to outweigh the unite testimony of mankind base on sense and consciousness i say a simple denial because the subject scarcely admit of reason and he add why should man claim to be exempt from the fate of all the other animals the whole earth believe me philo be curse and pollute a perpetual war go on among all live creatures need hunger and deprivation stimulate the strong and courageous fear anxiety and terror agitate the weak and infirm the first entrance into life bring distress to the newborn infant and to its wretched it be maintain by dr king and a few others before leibniz but not by any as famous as that german philosopher mother weakness impotence and distress accompany each stage of that life and eventually it reach its end in agony and horror observe too say philo natures intricate devices for embitter the life of every live be the stronger ones prey on the weaker and keep them in perpetual terror and anxiety the weaker in their turn often prey on the stronger and vex and trouble them give them no respite think of the innumerable race of insects that either be breed on the body of an animal or fly about put their sting into him these insects be themselves torment by others that be even smaller and thus on every hand before and behind above and below every animal be surround by enemies that constantly seek his misery and destruction man alone say demea seem to be a partial exception to this rule for by come together in society men can easily master lions tigers and bear whose greater strength and agility naturally enable them to prey on him on the contrary exclaim philo it be just here that we can most clearly see how uniform and equal natures maxims be it be true that man can by combine surmount all his real enemies and become master of the whole animal kingdom but doesnt he immediately conjure up imaginary enemies the demons of his imagination who haunt him with superstitious terrors and blast every enjoyment of life he imagine that they see his pleasure as a crime and that his food and leisure annoy and offend them even his sleep and dream bring him new materials for anxious fear and death his refuge from every other ill present only the dread of endless and innumerable woes the wolf attack on the timid flock be no worse than what superstition do to the anxious feel of wretched mortals besides demea think about this very society through which we get the upper hand over those wild beasts our natural enemies what new enemies it raise against us what woe and misery it cause man be the greatest enemy of man oppression injustice contempt disrespect violence sedition war slander treachery fraudmen use these to torment one another and they would soon dissolve the society they have form if they werent afraid that even greater ills would come from their do so these external injuries say demea that we suffer from animals from men and from all the elements do indeed form a frightful catalogue of woes but they be nothing in comparison to the ones that arise within ourselves from the illnesses of our mind and body how many people lie under the linger torment of diseases hear the pathetic list of the great poet intestine stone and ulcer colicpangs demoniac frenzy mop melancholy and moonstruck madness pin atrophy marasmus and widewasting pestilence dire be the toss deep the groan despair tend the sick busiest from couch to couch and over them triumphant death his dart shake but delayd to strike though oft invokd with vow as their chief good and final hope milton paradise lose the disorder of the mind continue demea though they be more secret may be no less dismal and vexatious remorse shame anguish rage disappointment anxiety fear dejection despair who have ever pass through life without cruel attack from these tormentors many people have scarcely ever felt any better sensations than those labour and poverty so hat by everyone be the certain fate of the majority and the privilege few who enjoy leisure and wealth never reach contentment or true happiness all the goods of life put together would not make a very happy man but all the ills together would make a wretch indeed life can indeed be make unsatisfactory by almost any one of the ills and who can be free from every one or indeed by the lack of any one good and who can possess all if an alien suddenly arrive in this world i would show him as a specimen of its ills a hospital full of diseases a prison crowd with criminals and debtors a field of battle with corpses all over it a fleet of ship sink in the ocean a nation suffer under tyranny famine or plague to turn the cheerful side of life to him and give him a notion of its pleasures where should i take him to a ball to an opera to court he might reasonably think that i be only show him other kinds of distress and sorrow there be no way to escape such strike instance say philo except by explain them awayand that make the indictment even more severe why i ask have all men in all age complain incessantly of the miseries of life someone reply they have no good reason they complain only because they be dispose to be discontent regretful anxious i reply what greater guarantee of misery could there be than to have such a wretched temperament but if they be really as unhappy as they claim say my antagonist why do they stay alive not satisfy with life afraid of death milton paradise lose this be the secret chain that hold us i reply we be terrify not bribe into continue our existence it be only a false delicacy he may insist which a few refine spirit permit themselves and which have spread these complaints among the whole race of mankind and what be this delicacy i ask which you blame isnt it just a greater awareness of all the pleasures and pain of life and if the man of a delicate refine cast of mind by be so much more alive than the rest of the world be only make so much more unhappy what conclusion should we reach about human life in general if men remain at rest say our adversary they would be at ease through all their busy ambitious activity they be will makers of their own misery no i reply leisure make them anxious and slack not that it would do any good for them to give up leisure for activity and ambition bring disappointment vexation and trouble i can see something like what you describe in some others reply cleanthes but i confess that i feel little or nothing of it in myself and i hope it isnt as common as you make it out to be if you dont feel human misery yourself exclaim demea i congratulate you on your happy uniqueness others seemingly the most prosperous havent be ashamed to give voice to their complaints in the saddest tone let us attend to the great the fortunate emperor charles v when tire with human grandeur he resign all his extensive dominions into the hand of his son in the last speech he make on that memorable occasion he publicly testify that the greatest prosperities he have ever enjoy have be mix with so many adversities that he could truly say that he have never enjoy any satisfaction or contentment but do the retire life in which he hop to shelter give him any greater happiness if we can believe his sons account he start to regret his abdication on the very day he abdicate ciceros fortune rise from small beginnings to the greatest glory and fame yet his letter to friends as well as his philosophical discourse contain ever so many pathetic complaints about the ills of life and suitably to his own experience he introduce catothe great the fortunate catoprotesting in his old age that if a new life be his for the ask he would turn it down ask yourself ask anyone you know whether they would be will to live over again the last ten or twenty years of their live no but the next twenty they say will be better human misery be so great that it reconcile even contradictions and so people eventually come to complain about the shortness of life and in the same breath complain of its pointlessness and sorrow and be it possible cleanthes say philo that after all these reflections and countless others that might be suggest you still stick to your anthropomorphism and assert that the moral attribute of godhis justice benevolence mercy and uprightnessare of the same nature as these virtues in human creatures we grant that his power be infinite whatever he will to happen do happen but neither man nor any other animal be happy therefore god doesnt will their happiness his knowledge be infinite he be never mistake in his choice of mean to any end but the course of nature doesnt lead to human or animal happiness therefore nature isnt establish for that purpose through the whole range of human knowledge there be no inferences more certain and infallible than these well then in what respect do his benevolence and mercy resemble the benevolence and mercy of men epicuruss old question have still not be answer be he will to prevent evil but not able then he be impotent be he able but not will then he be malevolent be he both able and will then where do evil come from in this work as in all write on the problem of evil the topic be the entire range of bad state of affairs include every kind of suffer it be not confine to the extreme moral badness that evil stand for today you ascribe a purpose and intention to nature cleanthes and i think you be right about that but what i ask you be the aim of all the intricately design machinery that nature have display in all animals here be my answer to that the aim be simply the preservation of individuals and the continuance of the species it seem enough for natures purpose if the species be merely enable to stay in existence without any care or concern for the happiness of its individual members no mean for this be provide no machinery aim purely at give pleasure or ease no store of pure joy and contentment no gratification without some lack or need to go with it or perhaps not quite none but at least the few phenomena of this nature be outweigh by opposite phenomena of greater importance our sense of music harmony and indeed beauty of all kinds give satisfaction without be absolutely necessary to the preservation and propagation of the species but contrast that with the rack pain that arise from gouts gravel migraines toothaches rheumatisms where the injury to the animal machinery be either small so that no painsignal be need or incurable so that no painsignal be useful joy laughter play frolic seem to be gratuitous satisfactions that dont lead to anything further and spleen melancholy discontent superstition be pain that also lead nowhere how then do gods benevolence display itself accord to you anthropomorphites it be only we mystics as you be please to call us who can account for this strange mixture of phenomena by derive it from divine attribute that be infinitely perfect but incomprehensible at last philo say cleanthes with a smile you have let us see what you have be up to your long agreement with demea surprise me a little but now i see that all along you be prepare to train your gun on me and i must admit that you have now come to a subject that be worthy of your notable spirit of opposition and controversy if you can make good on your present point and prove mankind to be unhappy or corrupt there be an immediate end to all religion for what be the point of establish the natural attribute of god while his moral attribute be still doubtful and uncertain youre very quick to object reply demea to innocent opinions that be the most widely accept even among religious and devout people im immensely surprise to find this theme of the wickedness and misery of man be charge with of all things atheism and profaneness havent all pious divine and preachers who have lavish their rhetoric on this rich topic give a solution for any difficulties that may come with it this world be a mere point in comparison with the universe this life be a mere moment in comparison with eternity the present evil phenomena therefore be set right in other regions and at some future time and when that happen the eye of men be then open to broader view of things will see the whole connection of general laws and with admire wonder trace gods benevolence and justice through all the mazes and intricacies of his providence no reply cleanthes no these arbitrary suppositions can never be admit they be contrary to visible and unchallenged facts how can any cause be know except from its know effect how can any hypothesis be prove except from the experience phenomena to base one hypothesis on another be to build entirely in the air and the most we ever achieve through these conjecture and fictions be to show that our opinion be possible we can never in this way establish that it be true the only way to support divine benevolenceand it be what i willingly acceptis to deny absolutely the misery and wickedness of man your picture of the human condition be exaggerate your melancholy view be mostly fictitious your conclusions be contrary to fact and experience health be more common than sickness pleasure than pain happiness than misery i calculate that for each vexation that we meet with we get a hundred enjoyments your position be extremely doubtful reply philo but even if we allow it you must at the same time admit that if pain be less frequent than pleasure it be infinitely more violent and last one hour of pain be often able to outweigh a day a week a month of our ordinary tepid enjoyments and some people pass days weeks and months in the most acute torment pleasure hardly ever rise to the height of ecstasy and rapture and it can never continue for any time at its highest pitch and altitude the spirit evaporate the nerve relax the body be out of order and the enjoyment quickly degenerate into fatigue and uneasiness but pain oftengood god how oftenrises to torture and agony and the longer it continue the more thoroughly it become genuine agony and torture patience be exhaust courage fade melancholy seize us and nothing put an end to our misery except the removal of its causeor another event that be the sole cure of all evil though our natural foolishness lead us to regard it with still greater horror and consternation all this be obvious certain and important continue philo but i shant go on about it i do take the opportunity to warn you cleanthes that you have take your stand on most dangerous grind and without realize it have introduce a total scepticism into the most essential article of natural and reveal theology what no way to give religion a sound basis unless we allow the happiness of human life and maintain that a continue existence even in this worldwith all our actual pain infirmities vexations and folliesis satisfactory and desirable this be contrary to everyones feel and experience which mean that it be contrary to an authority so well establish that nothing can undercut it no decisive proof can ever be produce against this authority nor be it possible for you to compute estimate and compare all the pain and all the pleasures in the live of all men and of all animals and so when you rest the whole system of religion on a claim which from its very nature must for ever be uncertain you tacitly admit that the system be equally uncertain animal happiness or at least human happiness in this life exceed its miserynoone will ever believe this or at any rate youll never be able to prove it but even if we grant it to you your argument have still achieve nothing for this be far from what we expect from infinite power infinite wisdom and infinite goodness why be there any misery at all in the world not by chance surely from some cause then be it from the intention of god but he be perfectly benevolent be it contrary to his intention but he be almighty nothing can shake the solidity of this reason so short so clear so decisiveunless we say that these subject exceed all human capacity and that our common measure of truth and falsehood be not applicable to them a thesis i have all along insist on but which you have from the outset reject with scorn and indignation but i will be content to shift back from this position do this voluntarily for i deny that you can ever force me out of it i will allow for purpose of argument that pain or misery in man be compatible with infinite power and goodness in god even when these attribute be understand in your way what help do all these concessions give to your position a mere possible compatibility be not sufficient you must prove the existence of these pure unmixed and uncontrollable attribute from the present mix and confuse phenomena and from these alone a hopeful undertake even if the phenomena be ever so pure and unmixed because they be finite they would be insufficient for your purpose how much more inadequate when they be also so jar and discordant here cleanthes i find i can relax in my argument here i triumph when we argue earlier about the natural attribute of intelligence and design i need all my sceptical and metaphysical subtlety to escape your grasp in many view of the universe and of its part particularly its part the beauty and fitness of final cause strike us with such irresistible force that all objections seem to be as i think they really be mere faultfinding and trickery and then we cant imagine how we could ever give weight to them but there be no view of human life or of the condition of mankind from which we can smoothly infer the moral attribute of god or learn about that infinite benevolence conjoin with infinite power and infinite wisdom which we must discover by the eye of faith alone but now the table be turn it be now your turn to tug the labour oar and to defend your philosophical subtleties against the dictate of plain reason and experience i dont mind admit say cleanthes that i have be incline to suspect that the frequent repetition of the word infinite which we meet with in all theological writers have the flavour of praise more than of philosophy and that any purpose of reason and any purpose even of religion would be better serve if we content ourselves with more accurate and moderate expressions the term admirable excellent superlatively great wise and holythese sufficiently fill the imaginations of men and anything that go further than they do have two drawbacks it lead into absurdities and it have no influence on our feel or beliefs the way someone feel about a god who be infinitely great be exactly the way he would feel about a god who be superlatively great thus in our present subject if we abandon all human analogy as you seem to want demea i be afraid we abandon all religion and be leave with no conception of god the great object of our admire wonder if we keep the human analogy while also stay with infinite well never be able to reconcile any mixture of evil in the universe with infinite attribute much less can we ever infer the attribute from the facts about what evil there be in the universe but if we suppose the author of nature to be only finitely perfect though far more perfect than mankind we can give a satisfactory account of natural and of moral evil and every bad phenomenon can be explain and harmonize with the rest a lesser evil may then be choose in order to avoid a greater inconvenience may be put up with in order to reach a desirable end and in brief benevolence guide by wisdom and limit by necessity can produce just such a world as the one we have you philo who be so prompt at launch view and reflections and analogies i would be glad to hearat length and without interruptionyour opinion of this new theory of mine if it turn out to deserve our attention we can later take our time about shape it up and fill in detail my opinions reply philo arent worth be make a mystery of so without more ado ill tell you what occur to me regard this present subject it must be admit i think that if a be who have very limit intelligence and be utterly unacquainted with our universe be assure that it be the product of a be who though finite be very good wise and powerful this would lead him beforehand to expect something different from what our experience show the universe to be like he would never imagine merely from be inform that the cause be very good wise and powerful that the effect could be as full of vice and misery and disorder as it appear to be in this life suppose now that this person be bring into our world still sure that it be the workmanship of that sublime and benevolent be he might be surprise at the discrepancy with what he have expect but he wouldnt retract his former belief about the cause of the universe if that be found on any very solid argument for a person with such a limit intelligence must be aware of his own blindness and ignorance and must admit that these phenomena of vice misery etc may have explanations that hell never be able to understand but suppose that this creature be notas we be notconvinced in advance of a supreme intelligence benevolent and powerful but be leave to infer such a belief from the appearances of things this entirely alter the case and he will never find any reason for such a conclusion he may be fully convince of the narrow limit of his understand but this wont help him to make an inference concern the goodness of superior power because he have to make that inference from what he know not from what he be ignorant of the more you exaggerate his weakness and ignorance the more cautious you make him and the more you make him suspect that such subject be beyond the reach of his faculties you be oblige therefore to reason with him merely from the know phenomena and to drop every arbitrary supposition or conjecture if i show you a house or palace where there wasnt one convenient or agreeable apartment where the windows doors fireplaces passages stairs and the whole arrangement of the build be the source of noise confusion fatigue darkness and the extremes of heat and cold you would certainly blame the plan of the build without any further examination it would be no use for the architect to display his subtlety and to prove to you that if this door or that window be alter something worse would follow what he say may be strictly true it may be that it would only make things worse to alter one detail while leave the other part of the build unchanged but you would still say in general that if the architect have have skill and good intentions he could have plan the whole build and interrelate its part in such a way as to remedy all or most of these inconvenience his ignorance of such a planeven your own ignorance of such a planwill never convince you that it be impossible if you find any inconvenience and defect in the build you will alwaysstraight offcondemn the architect in short i repeat the question be the world consider overall and as it appear to us in this life different from what a limit be like a man would expect beforehand from a very powerful wise and benevolent god it must be a strange prejudice to assert that it isnt and from this i conclude that however consistent the world may be on certain assumptions and with allowance make with the idea of such a god it can never provide us with an inference to his existence the consistency be not absolutely deny only the inference conjecture especially when infinity be exclude from gods attribute may perhaps be sufficient to prove a consistency but they can never be foundations for any inference there seem to be four circumstances on which depend all or most of the trouble that beset conscious creatures and it isnt impossible that all these circumstances be necessary and unavoidable we know so little beyond common lifewe know indeed so little of common lifethat when it come to the way a universe be arrange any conjecture however wild may be correct so far as we can tell to the contrary and any conjecture however plausible may be erroneous so far as we can tell to the contrary the human understand in this deep ignorance and obscurity ought to be sceptical or at least cautious and oughtnt to accept any hypothesis whatever especially ones that arent support by any appearance of probability i claim that this be the case with regard to all the cause of evil and the circumstances on which it depend none of them appear to human reason to be in the slightest necessary or unavoidable and we cant suppose them to be so without let our imaginations run wild the first circumstance that introduce evil be the device or arrangement of the animal creation by which pain as well as pleasures be employ to rouse creatures to action and make them alert in the great work of selfpreservation now it seem to human understand that pleasure alone in its various level of intensity would suffice for this purpose it could have be like this all animals be constantly in a state of enjoyment but when they be urge by any of the necessities of naturesuch as thirst hunger wearinessinstead of pain they feel a lessen of pleasure and this prompt them to seek whatever it be that be need for their survival men pursue pleasure as eagerly as they avoid painor anyway they could have be so constitute that this be true of them so it seem clearly possible to carry on the business of life without any pain why then be any animal ever subject to such a sensation if animals can be free from it for an hour they could be free from it all the time and their be subject to pain be a positive fact about them not a mere absence of something it might have be impossible to provide it require a particular arrangement of their organs to produce pain just as it do to endow them with sight hear or any of the sense shall we conjecturewithout any appearance of reason for itthat such an arrangement be necessary and shall we build on that conjecture as we would on the most certain truth but a capacity for pain would not of itself produce pain if it werent for something else namely the worlds be govern by general laws and this seem to be in no way necessary for a very perfect be it be true that if each thing that happen be cause by an individual volition on gods part the course of nature would be perpetually break there would be no dependable regularities and so no man could employ his reason in the conduct of life but if some such volitions threaten to have that effect mightnt other particular volitions remedy this inconvenience in short might not god exterminate all misfortune wherever it be to be find and make everything all good through judiciously place individual volitions and thus without any preparation or long chain of cause and effect besides we should bear in mind that in the present arrangement of the world the course of nature though suppose to be entirely regular appear to us not to be so many events be uncertain and many disappoint our expectations countless kinds of happen whose cause be unknown and variablefor example health and sickness calm and tempesthave a great influence both on the fortunes of particular persons and on the prosperity of whole communities and indeed all human life depend in a way on such happen so a be who know the secret work of the universe might easily by particular volitions turn all these happen to the good of mankind and make the whole world happy without reveal himself in any operation a fleet whose purpose be useful to society might always meet with a fair wind good rulers might enjoy sound health and long life persons bear to power and authority might be endow with good temperaments and virtuous dispositions a few outcomes such as these regularly and wisely bring about would change the face of the world and yet they would no more seem to disturb the course of nature or thwart human conduct than do the present arrangement of things where the cause be secret and variable and complex some small touch give to caligulas brain in his infancy might have convert him into a trajan one wave a little higher than the rest by bury caesar and his fortune in the bottom of the ocean might have restore liberty to a considerable part of mankind there may for all we know be good reason why providence doesnt intervene in this manner but we dont know them and though the mere supposition that such reason exist may be sufficient to save the conclusion concern the divine attribute from be refute by the observe facts it can surely never be sufficient to establish that conclusion if everything in the universe be govern by general laws and if animals be make capable of pain it seem almost inevitable that some misfortune will arise in the various collisions of matter and the various agreements and clash between general laws but such misfortune would be very rare if it werent for the third of the four factor that i propose to mention it be the great frugality with which all power and abilities be distribute to every particular be the organs and capacities of all animals be so well organize and so well fit to their preservation thatjudging by history and traditionthere appear never yet to have be a species that be extinguish in the universe every animal have the endowments it need but these endowments be give out with such careful economygiving each creature only the bare necessities for its survivalthat if anything considerable be take away from them the creature be entirely destroy wherever one power be increase there be a proportional lessen of the others animals that excel in speed be commonly lack in strength those that have both be either imperfect in some of their sense or be oppress with the most crave want the human species whose chief excellence be reason and foresight have more need and fewer bodily advantage than any of the others think of how humans would be situate if they be without clothe without weapons without food without lodge without any convenience of life except what they owe to their own skill and hard work in short nature seem to have calculate exactly what her creatures need andlike a stern employerhas grant them little more than the power or endowments that be strictly sufficient to meet those need an indulgent parent would have provide a great deal extra so as to guard against unforeseen events and to secure the happiness and welfare of the creature in the worst crises he would not have leave us in a condition where every course of life be surround with precipices to such an extent that the least departure from the true pathwhether by mistake or by necessityis bind to involve us in misery and ruin some reserve some emergency fund would have be provide to ensure happiness and our power and our need wouldnt have be so strictly balance against each other the author of nature be inconceivably powerful his force be suppose to be great even if not limitless and theres no reason we can find why he should be so strictly frugal in his deal with his creatures if his power be extremely limit hed have do better to create fewer animals and to have endow these with more mean for be happy and stay alive a builder be never regard as prudent if he tackle a plan that he hasnt the materials to finish in order to remedy most of the misfortunes of human life i dont require that man should have the wing of the eagle the swiftness of the stag the force of the ox the arm of the lion the scale of the crocodile or rhinoceros much less do i demand the intelligence of an angel i will settle for an increase in one single power or capacity of his mind let him be endow with a greater like for work a more vigorous bounce and activity of mind a more constant tendency to get on with his business if the whole species possess naturally the same high level of diligence that many individuals cultivate in themselves the immediate and necessary result of this endowment would be the most beneficial consequences with no taint of anything bad almost all the moral evils of human life as well as its natural evils arise from idleness and if our species have be build so as to be inherently free of this vice or infirmity the immediate result would have be the perfect cultivation of land the improvement of arts and manufacture the exact performance of every office and duty and men would straight away have reach the state of society that as things be be only imperfectly achieve by the best regulate government but as hardworkingness be a power and indeed the most valuable of all the power nature seem to be determine to follow her usual policy and to bestow it on men with a very spar hand and to punish him severely for not have enough of it rather than to reward him for his achievements she have build him in such a way that nothing but the strongest need can force him to work and she exploit that fact in order to get him to work she use all his other want to overcome at least in part his lack of diligence thus endow him through hardship and need with some share of a faculty that she have deprive him of naturally here our demand can be agree to be very humble and thus all the more reasonable if we require the endowments of sharper intellect and wiser judgment of a more delicate taste for beauty of more sensitive feel of benevolence and friendship we might be tell that we be impiously claim to break the order of nature that we want to raise ourselves to a higher level of be that the gift that we ask for not be suitable to our state and condition would only bring us misery but it be hardi dare to repeat it it be hardthat when we be place in a world so full of want and necessities where almost every be and element be either our foe or refuse its assistance we should also have our own temperament to struggle with and should be deprive of the only facultynamely an inclination for hard workthat can protect us from these multiply evils the fourth factor lead to the misery and misfortune of the universe be the inaccurate workmanship of all the work and principles of the great machine of nature it must be admit that most part of the universe seem to serve some purpose and in most case the removal of a part would produce a visible defect and disorder in the whole the part all hang together and you cant change one without affect the rest more or less but at the same time it must be observe that none of these part or power however useful be so accurately adjust that they keep precisely within the limit of their usefulness all of them be apt much of the time to run to one extreme or the other this grand product the universe be so unfinished in every part and be carry out with such coarse brushstrokes that one would think that its maker hadnt yet put on its finish touch thus wind be need to blow away smoke and fog and noxious fume and to help men in navigation but often they grow to be tempests and hurricanes and then they become pernicious rain be necessary to nourish all the plant and animals of the earth but often there be droughts and often the rain be excessive heat be need for life and vegetation but isnt always find at the right level the health and prosperity of the animal depend on the make and mix of the fluids and juices of its body but the part of these fluids dont dependably perform their proper function the passions of the mindambition vanity love angerare extremely useful but they often overflow their bank and cause the greatest convulsions in society everything in the universe however advantageous frequently become pernicious through there be too much or too little of it and nature have not guard effectively against all disorder or confusion the irregularity be perhaps never so great as to destroy any species but be often sufficient to involve individuals in ruin and misery there be the four factor on which all or most natural evil depend if all live creatures be incapable of feel pain or if the world be govern by particular volitions evil never could have find its way into the universe and if animals be endow with a large stock of power and faculties beyond what they strictly need for survival or if the various spring and principles of the universe be so accurately devise as to preserve always the temperate middle level and not run to extremes there would have be very little misfortune compare to what we feel at present what then shall we say about all this shall we say that the universe could easily have be design so as to be different in these four respect this decision seem too presumptuous for creatures as blind and ignorant as we be let us be more modest in our conclusions let us allow that if the goodness of god i mean a goodness like human goodness could be establish by any respectable a priori argument these phenomena however unfortunate wouldnt be sufficient to undercut that principle of gods goodness for the phenomena might be easily reconcilable to it in some way we dont know about but we should still maintain that as gods goodness be not antecedently establish and have to be infer from the phenomena there can be no ground for such an inference when there be so many misfortunes in the universe and while these misfortunes couldas far as human understand can be allow to judge on such a subjecteasily have be remedied i be sceptic enough to allow that the bad appearances notwithstanding all my reason may be compatible with such divine attribute as you suppose but surely they can never prove these attribute the conclusion that god be good can not result from scepticism but must arise from the phenomena and from our confidence in the reason through which we draw conclusions from these phenomena look around this universe what an immense profusion of be animate and organize conscious and active you admire this prodigious variety and fruitfulness but look a little more closely at these live things the only ones worth think about how hostile and destructive they be to each other how far they all be from be able to achieve their own happiness how contemptible or odious they be to the spectator the whole picture be one of a blind nature impregnate by some powerful lifegiving force and pour forth from her lap without discernment or parental care her maim and abortive children here the manichaean systemaccording to which the universe be govern by two fundamental force one good and the other badcomes to mind as a good hypothesis to solve the difficulty no doubt it be in some respect very attractive and its give a plausible account of the strange mixture of good and ill that appear in life make it more probable than the common hypothesis of a single benevolent god but if on the other hand we think about the perfect uniformity and agreement of the part of the universe we shant discover in it any sign of a malevolent be battle against a benevolent one there be indeed an opposition of pain and pleasures in the feel of conscious creatures but arent all the operations of nature carry on by an opposition of force of hot and cold moist and dry light and heavy the true conclusion be that the original source of all things be entirely indifferent to all these force and no more prefer good above evil than heat above cold or drought above moisture or light above heavy four hypotheses can be form concern the first cause of the universe that they be endow with perfect goodness that they have perfect malice that they be opposite and have both goodness and malice that they have neither goodness nor malice mix phenomena can never prove the two former unmixed principles and the uniformity and steadiness of general laws seem to oppose the third the fourth therefore seem by far the most probablethat be that the first cause of the universe be neutral with regard to good and bad what i have say about natural evil also apply with little or no change to moral evil we have no more reason to infer that the uprightness of the supreme be resemble human uprightness than that his benevolence resemble human benevolence indeed it will be think that we have more reason to exclude from him moral feel such as ours because many people think that moral evil predominate over moral good more than natural evil above natural good but even if this be reject and even if the virtue that mankind have be acknowledge to be much superior to the vice still as long as there be any vice at all in the universe you anthropomorphites will be very puzzle over how to account for it you must assign a cause for it without bring in the first cause but every effect must have a cause and that cause must have another and so you must either carry on the sequence ad infinitum or bring it to an end with that original principle who be the ultimate cause of all things wait wait exclaim demea where be your imagination take you i ally myself with you in order to prove the incomprehensible nature of the divine be and to refute the principles of cleanthes who want to measure everything by human rule and standards but now i find you agree with all the view of the greatest libertines and infidels and betray that holy cause which you seem earlier to embrace be you secretly then a more dangerous enemy than cleanthes himself have it take you this long to see that reply cleanthes believe me demea your friend philo have from the outset be amuse himself at my expense and at yours and i must admit that the incautious reason of our common theology have give him all too good a handle for ridicule the total infirmity of human reason the absolute incomprehensibility of gods nature the great and universal misery and the still greater wickedness of menthese be strange theme surely to be so fondly cherish by orthodox churchmen and professors in age of stupidity and ignorance indeed these principles may safely be espouse and it may be that the best way to promote superstition be to encourage mankind in its blind bewilderment its lack of confidence its gloom but at present dont blame the trouble so much on the ignorance of these reverend gentlemen interrupt philo they know how to change their style with the time formerly it be a most popular line in theology to maintain that human life be empty and miserable and to exaggerate all the ills and pain that men undergo but in recent years we have find theologians begin to withdraw from this position and to maintain though still with some hesitation that even in this life there be more goods than evils more pleasures than pain when religion depend entirely on temperament and education it be think proper to encourage gloom for indeed men be most ready to appeal to superior power when they be feel gloomy but now that men have learn to form principles and draw conclusions so that religion depend on arguments rather than merely on how you feel and how you have be indoctrinate it be necessary to bring some different gun to bear and to make use of arguments that can survive at least some scrutiny and examination this change of tactics be the same and from the same cause as the one i formerly remark on with regard to scepticism in this way philo continue to the last his spirit of opposition and his condemnation of establish opinions but i could see that demea didnt at all like the last part of what he say and soon after that he make some excuse or other to leave the group after demeas departure cleanthes and philo continue the conversation in the follow manner our friend i be afraid say cleanthes wont be much incline to revive this topic of discussion in a group contain you and to tell you the truth philo on a subject that be so elevate and that matter so much i would prefer to reason with you or with demea alone your spirit of controversy join to your hatred of common superstition carry you to strange lengths when you be engage in an argument and on such an occasion you dont spare anything however sacred and venerable it be even in your own eye i must admit reply philo that i be less cautious on the subject of natural religion than on any other both because i know that i can never corrupt the principles concern religion of any man of common sense and because i be confident that noone who see me as a man of common sense will ever misunderstand my intentions you in particular cleanthes with whom i live in unreserved intimacyyou be aware that despite the freedom of my conversation and my love of unusual arguments noone have a deeper sense of religion impress on his mind than i do or offer more profound adoration to the divine be as he reveal himself to our reason in the inexplicable design and artfulness of nature the most careless the most stupid thinker see everywhere a purpose an intention a design and no man can be so harden in absurd systems as to reject that at all time that nature do nothing in vain be a maxim establish in all the universities merely on the strength of observe the work of nature without any religious purpose and from a firm conviction of its truth an anatomist who have observe a new organ or canal in an animal body would never be satisfy until he have also discover what it do and what it be for one great foundation of the copernican system be the maxim that nature act by the simplest methods and choose the most proper mean to any end and astronomers often without think of it lay this strong foundation stone on which can be erect the edifice of piety and religion the same thing be observable in other branch of learn and thus almost all the sciences lead us insensibly to acknowledge a first think author and their authority be often all the greater for the fact that they dont openly say that thats what they mean to do it be with pleasure that i hear galen reason concern the structure of the human body the anatomy of a man he say reveal more than different muscle and anyone who study these will find that in each of them nature must have take into account at least ten different circumstances in order to achieve the end that she propose right shape right size right disposition of the several end the upper and lower position of the whole muscle the proper insertion of the various nerve vein and arteries so that in the muscle alone more than different plan and intentions must have be form and carry out he calculate that there be bone and that the structure of each of them aim at more than forty purpose what an enormous display of plan even in these simple and homogeneous part but if we consider the skin ligaments bloodvessels glands bodily fluids the various limbs and members of the bodyhow our astonishment must increase in proportion to the number and intricacy of the part so artfully relate to one another as we go further in these research we discover new scenes of skill and wisdom but we can tell that further down the smallness scale there be yet other scenes beyond our perceptual reach in the fine internal structure of the part in the organization of the brain in the build of the seminal vessels all these devices be repeat in every different species of animal with wonderful variety and in each case exactly right for the intentions of nature in form the species in question and if galens irreligion couldnt withstand such strike appearances even when these natural sciences be still imperfect a scientist today must indeed be stubbornly obstinate if he can doubt that there be a supreme intelligence if i meet with one of this sort thank god they be very rare i would ask him suppose there be a god who didnt reveal himself immediately to our sensesenabling us to see or feel or hear himcould he possibly give stronger proof of his existence than the proof that do appear on the whole face of nature what indeed could such a divine be do but copy the present arrangement of things make many of his artifices so obvious that no stupidity could mistake them provide glimpse of still greater artifices that demonstrate his prodigious superiority above our narrow mind and conceal a great many of them altogether from such imperfect creatures as we be now accord to all rule of sound reason every factual proposition count as indisputable when it be support by all the arguments that its nature admit of even if those arguments arent in themselves very numerous or strong how much more this apply in the present case where no human imagination can compute the number of the arguments and no understand can take in how strong they be i shall add say cleanthes to what you have so well urge that one great advantage of the principle of theism be that its the only system of cosmogony that can be make intelligible and complete while also preserve throughout a strong analogy to what we see and experience in the world every day the comparison of the universe to a machine of human design be so obvious and natural and be justify by so many examples of order and design in nature that it must immediately occur to all unprejudiced mind and win universal approval whoever want to weaken this theory cant claim to succeed by establish in its place any other that be precise and determinate for there be no such rival it be sufficient for him if he raise doubt and difficulties and by remote and abstract view of things reach that suspense of judgment which on this topic be the most he can wish for but this state of mind as well as be in itself unsatisfactory can never be steadily maintain against such strike appearances as continually draw us into the religious hypothesis human nature be capable through the force of prejudice of obstinately persevere in a false absurd system but i think it be absolutely impossible to maintain or defend have no system at all in opposition to a theory that be support by strong and obvious reason by natural propensity and by early education i have so little respect for this suspension of judgment about the existence of god say philo that im incline to suspect that this controversy be more of a verbal dispute than be usually imagine that the work of nature be very like the products of human ingenuity be evident and accord to all the rule of good reason we ought to inferif we argue at all about themthat their cause be correspondingly alike but as there be also considerable differences between the work of nature and human products we have reason to suppose that their cause be correspondingly unalike and that in particular we ought to attribute a much higher degree of power and energy to the supreme cause than to any we have ever observe in mankind here then the existence of a god be plainly discover by reason and if there be a question as to whether these analogies entitle us to call him a mind or intelligence give the vast difference that can reasonably be suppose to exist between him and human mind what be this but a mere verbal controversy no man can deny the liken between the effect to hold back from enquire about the cause be scarcely possible from this enquiry the legitimate conclusion be that the cause be also alike in some respect and if we arent content with call the first and supreme cause only a god or deity but want to find other word to apply to him what can we call him but mind or think give that he be justly suppose to bear a considerable resemblance to mind all sensible people be annoy by verbal dispute which occur so often in philosophical and theological enquiries and it be find that the only remedy for this misuse of language come from clear definitions from the precision of the ideas that enter into any argument and from strictly keep to the mean of the term one use but there be one sort of controversy which from the very nature of language and of human ideas be involve in perpetual ambiguity and can never by any precaution or any definitions reach a reasonable certainty or precision these be the controversies about the degrees of any quality or circumstance be hannibal a great or a very great or a superlatively great man how beautiful be cleopatra what term of praise be livy or thucydides entitle to men may argue to all eternity about such question without ever settle on agree answer the disputants may here agree in what they think and differ in the word they useor vice versaand yet never be able to define their term so as to understand each others mean thats because the degrees of these qualities unlike quantity or number cant be measure on any exact scale that could be the standard in the controversy the slightest enquiry reveal that the dispute concern theism be of this nature and consequently be merely verbalor perhaps still more incurably ambiguous if that be possible i ask the theist if he doesnt agree that the difference between the human mind and the divine mind be great and because it be incomprehensible immeasurable and the more pious he be the readier he will be to agree and the more he will be dispose to magnify the difference he will even assert that the difference be so great that it would be impossible to exaggerate how great it be i next turn to the atheistwho i say be only nominally an atheist and cant possibly be seriously soand i ask him whether judge by the coherence and apparent coordination among all the part of this world there isnt a certain similarity among all the operations of nature in every situation and in every agewhether the rot of a turnip the come into existence of an animal and the structure of human think be not energies that probably bear some remote analogy to each otherand he cant possibly deny it indeed he will readily acknowledge it have obtain this concession from him i push the selfdescribed atheist back still further i ask him if it isnt likely that the source that first order this universe in general and still keep it in order bear also some remote and hardtograsp analogy to the particular operations of nature include the arrangements that produce the human mind and think however reluctantly he must say yes then i ask both these antagonists what be you argue about the theist allow that the original intelligence be very different from human reason the atheist allow that the original source of order bear some remote analogy to it will you quarrel gentlemen about the degrees of difference and of similarity and enter into a controversy that cant be make precise and thus cant be settle if you be to persist obstinately i wouldnt be surprise to find you unknowingly change sidesthe theist exaggerate the dissimilarity between the supreme be and frail imperfect variable fleet and mortal creatures while the atheist exaggerate the similarity that there be among all the operations of nature at every time and in every place and circumstance consider then what you be really disagree about and if you cant set aside the disagreement at least realize that it concern the place of certain dissimilarities on a scale for which there be no precise measure and thus try to cure yourselves of your hostility to one another and here i must also acknowledge cleanthes that as the work of nature be more like the effect of our skill and plan than they be like the effect of our benevolence and justice we have reason to infer that gods nonmoral attribute have a greater resemblance to those of men than his moral attribute have to human virtues but what follow from that only that man moral qualities be more defective in their kind than be his nonmoral abilitiesfor example that man justice be a worse sample of justice than his cleverness be a sample of cleverness for it be agree that god be absolutely and entirely perfect so whatever differ most from him depart the furthest from the supreme standard of moral uprightness and perfection these cleanthes be my undisguised view on this subject and you know that i have uphold and value them for a long time but my veneration for true religion be match by my abhorrence of common superstitions and i admit that i get a special pleasure out of push superstitionssometimes into absurdity sometimes into impiety all bigots hate impiety more than they do absurdity but as you be well aware they be often equally guilty of both my inclination reply cleanthes lie in a different direction religion however corrupt be still better than no religion at all the doctrine of a future state be so strong and necessary a security to morals that we never ought to abandon or neglect it for if finite and temporary reward and punishments have such a great effect as we daily find that they do how much greater must be expect from reward and punishments that be infinite and eternal if common superstition be so good for society say philo then how do it happen that history be so full of account of its pernicious effect on public affairs factions civil war persecutions subversions of government oppression slaverythese be the dismal consequences which always accompany a prevalence of superstition in the mind of men whenever an historical narrative mention the religious spirit we be sure to find later in the story some detail of the miseries that come with it no period of time can be happier or more prosperous than those in which the religious spirit be never honour or hear of it seem obvious that the dispute between the sceptics and dogmatists be entirely verbal or at any rate it only concern how much doubt or assurance we should have in all our reason and dispute about that be often basically verbal and cant be definitively settle no philosophical dogmatist deny that there be difficulties both with regard to the sense and to all science and that these difficulties absolutely can not be resolve in a regular logical manner no sceptic deny that we despite these difficulties can not get out of think and believe and reason with regard to all kinds of subject or of often assent to things with confidence and security so the only difference between these sects if that be what they be be that the scepticfrom habit whim or inclinationinsists most on the difficulties the dogmatist for like reason insist on the necessity the reason for this reply cleanthes be obvious the proper role of religion be to regulate the heart of men humanize their conduct infuse the spirit of temperance order and obedience and as it work silently and only strengthen the motives of morality and justice it be in danger of be overlook and be confuse with those other motives when religion call attention to itself and act as a separate motive force in meninstead of be only a good influence on all the other motive forcesit have leave its proper sphere and have become only a cover for faction and ambition and so will all religion say philo except the philosophical and rational kind your reason be easier to escape from than be my facts because finite and temporary reward and punishments have so great influence therefore infinite and eternal ones must have so much greaterthis reason be not sound consider i beg you how much we care about present things and how little concern we express for object as remote and uncertain as the reward or punishments promise in the afterlife when preachers declaim against the common behaviour and conduct of the world they always represent this principle of concern for what be close as the strongest imaginable which indeed it be and they describe most of mankind as lie under its influence and sink into the deepest lethargy and lack of concern for their religious interest yet these same religious spokesmen defend religion against attack take the motives of religion to be so powerful that civil society couldnt survive without them and they arent ashamed of this obvious contradiction experience show us for sure that the smallest grain of natural honesty and benevolence have more effect on mens conduct than the most grandly inflate view suggest by theological theories and systems a man natural inclination work on him all the time it be always present to his mind and mingle itself with every view and consideration whereas religious motives where they act at all operate only by fit and start and it be scarcely possible for them to become altogether habitual to the mind the force of the greatest gravitational pull say the physicists be incomparably smaller than the force of the least push yet it be certain that the smallest gravity will eventually prevail over a large push because no stroke or blow can be repeat with such constancy as attraction and gravitation another advantage that inclination have in the tussle with duty it bring into play on its side all the sharpness and ingenuity of the mind and when it be place in opposition to religious principles it seek every method and device for elude themand it nearly always succeed who can explain the heart of man or account for those strange specialpleadings and excuse with which people let themselves off when they be follow their inclinations in opposition to their religious duty this be well understand in the world and only fool would trust a man less because they hear that study and philosophy have give him some speculative doubt with regard to theological subject and when we have deal with a man who make a great profession of religion and devotion doesnt this put many sensible people on their guard against be cheat and deceive by him we must further consider that philosophers who cultivate reason and reflection have less need of such religious motives to keep them under the restraint of morals and that common peoplethe only ones who may need religion to keep them in ordercant possibly have a religion so pure that it represent god as be please with nothing but virtue in human behaviour pleas for gods favour be generally understand to be either frivolous observances or rapturous ecstasies or a bigoted credulity and therefore not to reflect or to encourage moral seriousness we neednt go back to ancient time or wander into remote place to find instance of this degeneracy of religion divorce from morality amongst ourselves some people have be guilty of something atrocious that even the egyptian and greek superstitions be not guilty of namely speak out explicitly against morality say that if one put the least trust or reliance in morality one will certainly lose favour with god and even if superstition or fanaticism didnt put itself in direct opposition to morality it would still have the most pernicious consequences greatly weaken mens attachment to the natural motives of justice and humanity it would do this because of its divert of the attention away from morality its raise up of a new and frivolous sort of suppose merit and the preposterous way in which it distribute praise and blame such a religious actiondriver not be one of the familiar motives of human conduct act only intermittently on a persons temperament and it have to be rouse by continual efforts in order to render the pious zealot satisfy with his own conduct and make him fulfil his devotional task many religious exercise be begin with seem fervour although the persons heart at the time feel cold and apathetic he gradually acquire a habit of cover up his true feel and fraud and falsehood eventually become the predominant force in his mind this explain the common observation that the highest zeal in religion and the deepest hypocrisy so far from be inconsistent be often or usually unite in the same individual person the bad effect of such habit even in ordinary everyday life be easily imagine but where the interest of religion be concern no morality can be strong enough to constrain the fanatical zealot the sacredness of his causehe thinkssanctifies anything that he do to promote it steadily and exclusively attend to something as important to oneself as eternal salvation be apt to extinguish ones benevolent feel and to generate a narrow contract selfishness and when such a temperament be encourage it easily elude all the general precepts of charity and benevolence thus the motives of common superstition have no great influence on general conduct and where they do predominate their influence be not favourable to morality be any maxim in politics more certain and infallible than the one say that the number and the authority of priests should be confine within very narrow limit and that the civil magistrate ought never to allow the instrument of his authority fall into such dangerous hand as those of priests but if the spirit of popular religion the religion of ordinary people be as salutary to society as its defenders say it be a contrary maxim ought to prevail reflect a line of think like the follow the more priests there be in law and government the better a greater number of priests and their greater authority and riches will always increase the religious spirit and though the priests have the guidance of this spirit we can expect them also to develop ever greater moral decency in their feel why should we not expect a superior sanctity of life and greater benevolence and moderation from people who be set apart for religion who be continually preach it to others and who must themselves imbibe a greater share of it then how do it come about that in fact the most that a wise ruler can propose with regard to popular religions be as far as possible to make a save game of it to minimize losses without expect any gain and to prevent their pernicious consequences with regard to society every mean he use to carry out this modest purpose be surround with inconvenience if he allow only one religion among his subject he must sacrifice every consideration of public liberty science reason industry and even his own independenceall this in return for an uncertain prospect of religious peace if he allow several sects which be the wiser course for him to follow he must preserve a very philosophical evenhandedness regard all of them and carefully restrain the claim of the dominant sect otherwise he can expect nothing but endless dispute quarrel factions persecutions and civil commotions true religion i admit have no such pernicious consequences but we have to concern ourselves not with true religion but with religion as it have commonly be find in the world and i be not discuss the speculative thesis of theism be a philosophical theory it must share in the beneficial influence of philosophy while also suffer from philosophys drawback of be accept by very few people oaths be require in all court of law but do their authority arise from any popular religion i say no the chief restraints on mankind be the solemnity and importance of the occasion a concern for ones reputation and reflection on the general interest of society customhouse oaths declarations about what one be import or export and political oaths be not regard as bind even by some who claim to abide by principles of honesty and religion and we rightly put a quakers assertion on the same foot as the oath of any other person i know that polybius ascribe the notorious untrustworthiness of the greeks to the prevalence of the epicurean philosophy but i know also that carthaginian promise have as bad a reputation in ancient time as irish testimony do today and we cant account for these general impressions in the same way namely the influence of epicurean philosophy not to mention that the greeks be already notoriously untrustworthy before the rise of the epicurean philosophy and euripides have aim a remarkable stroke of satire against his nation with regard to trustworthiness take care philo reply cleanthes take care dont push matter too far dont allow your zeal against false religion to undermine your reverence for the true dont give up this religious principle which be the chief the only great comfort in life and our principal support amidst all the attack of adverse fortune the most agreeable reflection that the human imagination can possibly suggest be that of genuine theism which represent us as the workmanship of a be who be perfectly good wise and powerful a be who create us to be happy and who have implant in us immeasurable desire for good things will prolong our existence to all eternity take us into an infinite variety of scenes in order to satisfy those desire and make our happiness complete and last to be under the guardianship and protection of such a divine be be the happiest prospect we can imaginesecond only if this comparison be permissible to the happiness of the divine be himself that picture of how a person seem to relate to religion say philo be most engage and allure and when the person be a true philosopher it be more than just seem but here as before with regard to the greater part of mankind the appearances be deceitful and the terrors of religion commonly prevail over its comfort it be common knowledge that men never seek help from devotion so readily as when they be deject with grief or depress by sickness doesnt that show that the religious spirit be not so closely tie to joy as it be to sorrow but when men be afflict they find consolation in religion reply cleanthes sometimes say philo but it be natural to imagine that when they apply themselves to the contemplation of those unknown beingsthe gods of their religionthey will form a notion of them that be suitable to their own present gloom and melancholy accordingly we find in every religion that the image of god as fearsome predominate over all the other image of him and we ourselves after use the most exalt language in our descriptions of god fall into the flattest contradiction when we affirm that the damn infinitely outnumber those who be choose to be save i venture to assert that there have never be a popular religion which represent the state of depart souls in such a way as to make it a good thing from the human point of view that there should be such a state these fine model of religion that you speak of so cheerfully cleanthes be the mere product of philosophy and get no grip on the ordinary thoughts and feel of ordinary people when plain folk try to imagine the afterlife death intervene between the mind eye and the object and death be so shock to nature that it throw a gloom on all the regions that lie on the far side of it and suggest to the general run of people the idea of cerberus and furies devil and torrents of fire and brimstone it be true that both fear and hope enter into religion because both those passions agitate the human mind from time to time and each of them form a kind of divinity suitable to itself but when a man be in a cheerful frame of mind he be fit for business or company or entertainment of any kind and he naturally turn his attention to these and doesnt think of religion when gloomy and deject on the other hand he hasnt the spirit or energy to apply himself to anything in this world so all he can do be to brood on the terrors of the afterworld and thus make his condition worse than ever it may indeed happen that after he have in this way engrave the religious opinions deep into his think and imagination some change of health or circumstances restore his goodhumour and raise cheerful prospect of the afterlife send him to the other extreme of joy and triumph but still it must be admit that as terror be the drive force of religion it be the passion that always predominate in it and allow for only short periods of pleasure a further point these bouts of excessive extravagant joy by exhaust the spirit always prepare the way for equal bouts of superstitious terror and dejection the happiest state of mind be not frenzied joy but balance calm but it be impossible for a man to remain long in that state when he think that he lie in such profound darkness and uncertainty between an eternity of happiness and an eternity of misery no wonder that such an opinion unhinge the ordinary frame of the mind and throw it into the utmost confusion and though that opinion be seldom so steady in its operation that it influence all the persons action it be apt to make considerable inroads on his temperament and to produce the gloom and melancholy that be so noticeable in all devout people it be contrary to common sense to be anxious or terrify about what may happen to us in the afterlife on account of any opinion that we have or to imagine that the freest use of our reason will run us into any risk in the hereafter such a view imply both an absurdity and an inconsistency it be an absurdity to believe that god have human passions and indeed one of the lowest of them namely a restless appetite for applause it be an inconsistency to believe that god have this human passion but doesnt have others also and especially a disregard for the opinions of creatures so much inferior to know god say seneca be to worship him all other worshipthat be all worship that go beyond express ones knowledge that god existsis indeed absurd superstitious and even impious it degrade god to the low condition of ordinary men who be delight to be approach with entreaties request present and flattery yet this be the least of the impieties of which superstition be guilty commonly superstition push god down to a level far below that of mankind and represent him as a capricious demon who exercise his power without reason and without humanity if god be incline to be offend at the vices and follies of silly mortals who be his own workmanship the devote of most popular superstitions would be in for a very bad time none of the human race would deserve his favour except for a very few the philosophical theists who haveor at any rate try to havesuitable notions of his divine perfections and the only persons entitle to his compassion and leniency would be the philosophical sceptics an almost equally small sect whose natural modesty about their own capacities lead them to suspendor try to suspendall judgment with regard to such sublime and extraordinary subject if the whole of natural theology as some people seem to maintain boil down to one simple though somewhat ambiguous or at least undefined proposition the cause or cause of order in the universe probably bear some remote analogy to human intelligence if this proposition cant be extend vary or explain in more detail if it yield no inference that affect human life or can be the source of any action or forbearance from act and if the analogy imperfect as it be extend only to human intelligence and cant plausibly be transfer to the other qualities of the mindif all this really be the case what can the most curious thoughtful and religious man do except give a plain philosophical assent to the proposition as often as it come up and believe that the arguments on which it be base outweigh the objections against it he will naturally feel somewhat unnerve by the greatness of the object that be by the think of the cause of the universe somewhat sad that the object be hide from him somewhat contemptuous of human reason for its inability to make a better job of such an extraordinary and magnificent question but believe me cleanthes the most natural feel that a welldisposed mind will have on this occasion be a long desire and expectation hum phrase that god will be please to remove or at least to lessen this profound ignorance by give mankind some particular revelation reveal the nature attribute and operations of the divine object of our faith a person who have a sound sense of the imperfections of natural reason will eagerly fly to reveal truth while the haughty dogmatist persuade that he can erect a complete system of theology with no help but that of philosophy will disdain any further aid and will reject this help from the outside to be a philosophical sceptic be in a man of letter the first and most essential step towards be a sound believe christian a proposition which i would willingly recommend to the attention of pamphilus and i hope cleanthes will forgive me for interpose so far in the education and instruction of his pupil cleanthes and philo do not pursue this conversation much further and as nothing ever make greater impression on me than all the reason of that day so i confess that on carefully look over the whole conversation i can not help think that philos principles be more probable than demeas but that those of cleanthes approach still nearer to the truth
