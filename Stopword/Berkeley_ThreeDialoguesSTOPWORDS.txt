 three dialogues hylas philonous opposition sceptics atheists george berkeley content first dialogue second dialogue third dialogue first dialogue philonous good morning hylas didnt expect find early hylas indeed somewhat unusual thoughts take subject talk last night couldnt sleep decide get walk garden thats good give chance see innocent agreeable pleasures lose every morning pleasanter time day delightful season year purple sky wild sweet note bird fragrant bloom tree flower gentle influence rise sun thousand nameless beauties nature inspire soul secret raptures im afraid interrupt thoughts seem intent something yes id grateful would allow carry dont least want deprive company thoughts always flow easily conversation friend alone please may share thoughts heart would request hadnt ask first consider odd fate men age desire mark common people heaven know trick think claim either believe nothing believe extravagant things world wouldnt matter much paradoxes scepticism didnt bring consequences bad mankind general theres risk men think spend whole time pursuit knowledge claim entirely ignorant everything advocate view conflict plain commonly accept principles tempt peoplewho less leisure sort thingto become suspicious important truths ones previously think sacred unquestionable entirely agree bad effect parade doubt philosophers fantastical view others felt strongly recent time drop highflown theories learn universities replace ordinary common opinions since revolt mine metaphysical notions favour plain dictate nature common sense swear find think ever much better easily understand many things previously mysteries riddle glad find nothing account hear please last nights conversation represent someone maintain extravagant opinion ever enter mind man namely thing material substance world seriously believe thing philosophers call material substance make see anything absurd sceptical would reason renounce belief think reject contrary opinion anything fantastical conflict common sense obvious piece scepticism believe thing matter steady hylas turn hold matter areby virtue opiniona greater sceptic maintain paradoxes conflict common sense believe thing good chance convince part greater whole convince must give belief matter avoid absurdity scepticism well content accept true opinion turn agreeable common sense remote scepticism heart since want start arguments plainest things world content hear say tell please hylas mean sceptic mean everyone mean someone doubt everything someone doubt concern particular point regard point think sceptic agree doubt consist accept affirmative negative side question neither anyone understand english must know doubt signify suspense two side someone deny point say doubt concern affirm degree assurance true denial make sceptic acknowledge happen hylas call sceptic deny affirm namely existence matter know may firmly convince denial affirmation hold moment philonous definition sceptic wrong cant hold man every false step make conversation say sceptic someone doubt everything add deny reality truth things things mean principles theorems sciences know universal intellectual notions nothing matter denial matter doesnt imply denial agree things think distrust sense deny real existence sensible things claim know nothing isnt enough qualify man sceptic throughout dialogues sensible mean capable sensedthat visible audible tangible etc well let us see us deny reality sensible things claim greatest ignorance since understand rightly count greater sceptic desire mean sensible things things perceive sense imagine mean anything else im sorry may greatly shorten enquiry clear grasp notions bear ask question things perceive sense ones perceive immediately include things perceive mediately intervention something else dont properly understand read book immediately perceive letter page mediately mean notions god virtue truth etc suggest mind theres doubt letter truly sensible things things perceive sense want know whether take things suggest perceive sense certainly would absurd think god virtue sensible things though may signify suggest mind sensible mark arbitrary connection seem sensible things mean perceive immediately sense right doesnt follow see one part sky red another blue infer must cause difference colour cause say sensible thing perceive eyesight similarly hear variety sound say hear cause touch feel thing hot heavy cant say truth correctness feel cause heat weight head question kind tell sensible things mean things perceive sense sense

combinations sensible qualities nothing else heat sensible thing certainly reality sensible things consist perceive something different perceivedsomething doesnt involve mind exist one thing perceive another talk sensible things question real existence one mean existence exterior mind distinct perceive mean real absolute existencedistinct relation perceive heat grant real existence must exist outside mind must tell hylas real existence equally possible degrees heat feel reason attribute degrees heat others please tell whatever degree heat perceive sense sure exist also object occasion greatest well least yes reason hold perceive sense indeed greater degree heat intensely sensibly perceive difference certain real existence greater heat reality lesser isnt fierce intense degree heat great pain noone deny unperceiving thing pain pleasure certainly material substance senseless thing sense perception senseless without doubt cant subject pain indeed cant consequently subject greatest heat perceive sense since agree considerable pain accept say external object material substance material substance sensible qualities inhere great heat exist since agree exist material substance please clear point hold philonous im afraid go wrong grant intense heat pain say pain heat consequence effect heat put hand near fire feel one simple uniform sensation two distinct sensations one simple sensation isnt heat immediately perceive pain true well see immediately perceive time fire affect one simple uncompounded idea one idea without part follow one simple idea immediately perceive intense heat pain consequently immediately perceive intense heat identical particular sort pain seem consult thoughts hylas conceive intense sensation occur without pain pleasure form idea sensible pain pleasure general abstract every particular idea heat cold taste smell etc dont find doesnt follow sensible pain nothing intense degrees sensations ideas undeniable fact im start suspect great heat cant exist except mind perceive sceptical state suspense affirm deny think definite violent painful heat cant exist outside mind accord real existence admit certain body nature really hot havent say real heat body say theres thing intense real heat body didnt say earlier degrees heat equally real difference greater heat certainly real lesser yes overlook reason distinguish plainly see intense heat nothing particular kind painful sensation pain cant exist except perceive follow intense heat really exist unperceiving corporeal bodily substance thats reason deny less intense heat exist substance draw line separate degrees heat exist mind ones exist outside isnt hard slightest pain cant exist unperceived know degree heat pain exist mind dont think degrees heat pain think agree back unperceiving capable pleasure pain well isnt warmtha milder degree heat cause discomfort worsea pleasure follow warmth cant exist outside mind unperceiving substance body seem reach position degrees heat arent painful also ones exist think substance cant conclude external body absolutely incapable degree heat whatsoever second thoughts less sure warmth pleasure intense heat pain dont claim warmth great pleasure heat pain admit even small pleasure enough yield conclusion could rather call absence pain seem merely lack pain pleasure hope wont deny quality state one unthinking substance determine maintain warmth pleasure dont know convince otherwise except appeal experience think cold heat intense degree cold pain feel great cold experience great discomfort cant exist outside mind lesser degree cold exist outside mind well lesser degree heat feel moderate degree heat cold body apply skin must conclude body moderate degree heat cold must doctrine true necessarily lead absurdity certainly isnt absurdity think single thing time cold warm well suppose one hand hot cold plunge bowl water temperature two wont water seem cold one hand warm doesnt follow principles water really cold warm timethus believe something agree absurdity admit seem right principles false since admit true principle lead absurdity anything absurd say heat fire make point still clearer answer two case exactly alike oughtnt make judgment ought pin prick finger doesnt tear divide fibres flesh hot coal burn finger hold pin doesnt contain either sensation cause anything like give agree tonamely like case judge alikeyou ought hold fire doesnt contain either sensation cause anything like well since must content give point admit heat cold sensations exist mind still plenty qualities secure reality external things say hylas turn argument apply regard sensible qualities none suppose exist outside mind heat cold prove would quite feat see chance let us examine sensible qualities order taste think exist outside mind anyone right mind doubt sugar sweet wormwood bitter tell hylas sweet taste particular kind pleasure pleasant sensation isnt bitterness kind discomfort pain grant therefore sugar wormwood unthinking corporeal substances exist outside mind sweetness bitternessthat pleasure painbe hold philonous see delude time ask whether heat cold sweetness bitterness particular sort pleasure pain answer simply answer make distinction qualities perceive us pleasures pain exist external object conclude without qualification heat fire sweetness sugar heat sweetness perceive us fire sugar say say irrelevant talk sensible things define things immediately perceive sense whatever qualities talk place conversation dont know anything may indeed claim discover certain qualities dont perceive assert exist fire sugar cant life see serve side argument tell agree heat cold sweetness bitterness mean qualities perceive sense dont exist outside mind see use hold give cause respect four qualities though must say sound odd say sugar isnt sweet might sound better bear mind someone whose palate diseased may experience bitter stuff time seem sweet perfectly obvious different people perceive different taste food since one man delight another loathe could taste really inherent food admit dont know think odours dont exactly fit say taste arent many please displease sensations conceive possible exist unperceiving thing imagine filth excrement affect animals choose fee smell perceive mean cant conclude smell like qualities discuss exist anywhere perceive substance mind think sound qualities really inherent external body dont inhere sound body know bell strike vacuum send sound subject sound must air explain hylas air set motion perceive louder softer sound proportion air motion air still hear sound grant never hear sound except motion produce air still dont see infer sound air motion external air produce mind sensation sound strike eardrum cause vibration pass along auditory nerve brain whereon mind experience sensation call sound sound sensation say perceive us particular sensation mind sensation exist outside mind certainly sound sensation exist air air mean senseless substance exist outside mind philonous must distinguish sound perceive us sound orin wordsdistinguish sound immediately perceive sound exist outside us former indeed particular kind sensation latter merely vibration air think already flatten distinction answer give apply similar case ill let pass sure sound really nothing motion whatever true real sound therefore truthfully say motion may make sense speak motion something loud sweet pierce lowpitched see determine understand isnt obvious qualities belong sensible sound sound ordinary everyday mean word sound real scientific sense explain nothing certain motion air seem two sort soundthe common everyday sort hear scientific real sort dont hear latter kind sound consist motion tell tell hylas sense think idea motion belong sense hear certainly sense sight touch follow accord real sound may possibly see felt never hear look philonous make fun view want wont alter truth things admit inferences draw sound little odd ordinary language form ordinary people use surprise statements express exact scientific notions seem clumsy strange come assure think score pretty big win casually depart ordinary phrase opinions mainly argue whose notions furthest common road conflict people general think claim real sound never hear get idea sound sensecan think merely oddsounding scientific truth isnt something contrary nature truth things frankly dont like either give concessions already make better admit sound also real existence outside mind hope wont stick admit colour pardon case colour different anything obvious fact see colour object object speak suppose corporeal substances exist outside mind true real colour inhere visible object colour see hah anything visible perceive sight perceive anything sense dont perceive immediately often say tell bear hylas tell yet whether anything immediately perceive sense sensible qualities know assert nothing want know whether still think corporeal substance either sensible quality make sensible qualities question ask ever think ask say visible object colour see imply either visible object sensible qualities else something sensible qualities perceive sight earlier agree false still think leave thesis visible object sensible qualities conversation take visible object corporeal substances reach conclusion corporeal substances nothing sensible qualities may draw many absurd consequences please try entangle plainest things never persuade sense clearly understand mean wish would make understand since dont want look notion corporeal substance shall drop point please tell whether colour see ones exist external body colour ones oh beautiful red purple see cloud really rather think cloud nothing dark mist vapour must admit philonous colour arent really cloud seem distance apparent colour apparent call distinguish apparent colour real ones easily colour appear distance vanish one come closer merely apparent suppose real colour ones reveal look carefully close right closest careful way look use microscope naked eye microscope course microscope often reveal colour object different perceive unassisted sight microscopes could magnify much like certain object whatsoever see would appear colour present naked eye well conclude cant argue really naturally colour object contrive artificial ways alter make vanish obviously infer concessions think colour see naked eye apparentlike cloudssince vanish one look closely accurately one microscope anticipate next objection ask whether real natural state object reveal better sharp pierce sight one less sharp former without doubt isnt plain science optics microscopes make sight penetrate represent object would appear eye naturally endow extreme sharpness microscopic representation thing regard one best display things real nature thing colour perceive microscope genuine real perceive way admit theres something say besides possible clearly true actually animals whose eye naturally form perceive things small us see think inconceivably small animals perceive microscopes must suppose totally blind see dont suppose sight use preserve body injuries eyesight animals use isnt obvious must see particles smaller body present vastly different view object view strike sense even eye dont always represent object us way everyone know someone suffer jaundice things seem yellow isnt highly probable animals whose eye see differently structure whose bodily fluids unlike dont see colour every object shouldnt seem follow colour equally apparent none ones see really outer object put past doubt consider follow colour real properties qualities inhere external body couldnt alter except alteration body isnt evident colour object change make disappear entirely use microscope change fluids eye change view distance without sort real alteration thing indeed even factor remain unaltered object present different colour eye depend angle look thing happen view object different brightnesses light everyone know body appear differently colour candlelight daylight add facts experience prism separate different ray light thereby alter colour object cause whitest object appear deep blue red naked eye tell whether still think body true real colour inhere think want know particular distance orientation object special condition eye intensity kind light need discover true colour distinguish apparent ones admit quite convince equally apparent thing colour really inhere external body colour wholly light confirm opinion fact colour less vivid depend brightness light light colour see furthermore colour external object could possibly perceive external body affect mind unless act first senseorgans action body motion cant communicate except collisions distant object cant act eye cant enable properties perceive mind plainly follow immediately cause perception colour substance contact eyesuch light light substance tell philonous external light simply thin fluid substance whose tiny particles agitate brisk motion various ways reflect eye different surface outer object cause different motion optic nerve motion pass along brain cause various state events accompany sensations red blue yellow etc seem light shake optic nerve result particular motion nerve mind affect sensation particular colour right sensations existence outside mind say colour light since take light corporeal substance external mind light colour immediately perceive us exist outside mind admit motion arrangements certain insensible particles matter colour ordinary sensethat understand immediate object sightcannot substance doesnt perceive say well give position regard sensible qualities mankind take colour think like scientists invisible colour business argue suggest consider whether wise discussion like one affirm red blue see real colour certain unknown motion shape man ever could see real colour arent shock notions arent open many ridiculous inferences give case sound admit philonous cant keep longer colour sound tastesin word term secondary qualitieshave existence outside mind grant dont take anything away reality matter external object various philosophers maintain secondary qualities yet far deny matter context philosophers mean philosophers scientists make clearer philosophers divide sensible qualities primary secondary primary qualities extendedness shape solidity gravity motion rest hold really exist body secondary qualities sensible qualities arent primary philosophers assert merely sensations ideas exist nowhere mind doubt already aware part long know opinion current among philosophers never thoroughly convince truth till still believe extension shape inherent external unthinking substances extension could mean extendedness could mean size arguments bring secondary qualities hold also shall think shape extension also exist mind opinion shape extension perceive sense exist outer object material substance animals good reason think shape extension see feel outer object surely think tell hylas think sense give animals preservation wellbeing life give men end dont doubt use animals mustnt sense enable perceive limbs perceive body capable harm certainly tiny insect therefore must suppose see foot things size even smaller see body considerable size even though see themif allonly many visible point cant deny creatures even smaller insect seem even bigger something hardly pick small appear like huge mountain extremely tiny animal agree single thing different size time would absurd think say follow true size insects foot size see size insect see size see animals even smaller say principles lead absurdity seem difficulty another point didnt agree real inherent property object change unless thing alter move towards away object visible size vary one distance ten hundred time greater another doesnt follow size isnt really inherent object admit dont know think soon able make mind venture think freely quality others didnt admit legitimate infer neither heat cold water premise water seem warm one hand cold isnt reason infer size shape object premise one eye seem little smooth round eye appear big uneven angular latter ever happen time find look one eye bare microscope dont know maintain yet reluctant give extension size see many odd consequences follow concession extension isnt outer object odd say things already agree hope wont put anything odd case wouldnt seem odd general reason cover sensible qualities didnt apply also extension agree idea anything like idea exist unperceiving substance surely follow shape mode extension specific way extend idea ofin perceive imaginingcan really inherent matter whether sensible quality shape sound colour seem impossible subsist something doesnt perceive mention peculiar difficulty must conceive material substance prior distinct extension substratum extension ill say shortly give point reserve right retract opinion later discover lead false step right cant deny shape extendedness dispose proceed next motion real motion external body time swift slow isnt speed body move inversely proportional time take go give distance thus body travel mile hour move three time fast would travel mile three hours agree isnt time measure succession ideas mind isnt possible ideas succeed one another twice fast mind mine mind kind nonhuman spirit agree consequently body may seem another spirit make journey half time seem take half example fraction would make point well say accord view perceive motion object single body really move swiftly slowly time consistent either common sense recently agree nothing say solidity dont use solidity name sensible quality irrelevant enquiry use name sensible quality quality must either hardness resistance plainly relative sense obvious seem hard one animal may appear soft another greater force firmness limbs equally obvious resistance feel press body body agree sensation resistance immediately perceive body cause sensation cause sensations arent immediately perceive therefore arent sensible think settle point admit excuse seem little embarrass trouble quit earlier view may help consider point extendedness admit existence outside mind must grant motion solidity gravity since obviously presuppose extendedness superfluous enquire separately deny extendedness deny real existence right philonous wonder philosophers deny secondary qualities real existence yet attribute primary qualities theres difference account isnt business account every opinion philosophers many possible explanations one philosophers influence fact pleasure pain associate secondary qualities rather primary ones heat cold taste smell something vividly please disagreeable get ideas extendedness shape motion since visibly absurd hold pain pleasure unperceiving substance men easily wean believe external existence secondary qualities primary ones see something recall distinction make moderate heat intense heat allow one real existence outside mind deny rational basis distinction surely sensation neither please painful much sensation one please painful neither kind suppose exist unthinking subject come head philonous somewhere hear distinction absolute sensible extendedness grant large small consist merely relation extend things part body arent really substances still dont say absolute extendedness something abstract large small particular size shape similarly motion fast slow altogether relative succession ideas mind special case motion exist outside mind doesnt follow true absolute motion abstract distinguish one instance motion extendedness another isnt something sensiblefor instance speed size shape think qualitiesnamely absolute motion absolute extendednesswhich strip sensible properties feature make specific way right say extendedness general motion general say everyone accept maxim every thing exist particular motion general extendedness general exist corporeal substance need time think think point speedily decide without doubt tell whether able form idea mind im let present dispute settle follow way form thoughts distinct abstract idea motion extendedness none sensible qualitiesswift slow large small round square likewhich agree exist mind ill capitulate cant unreasonable insist longer something notion frank even separate ideas extendedness motion ideas socalled secondary qualities isnt easy consider extendedness motion abstract sensible qualities isnt mathematicians handle acknowledge hylas difficult form general proposition reason extendedness motion without mention qualities sense treat abstractedly pronounce word motion follow form mind idea motion without idea body theorems extension shape prove without mention large small sensible quality follow mind form grasp abstract idea extension without particular size shape sensible quality mathematicians study quantity disregard sensible qualities go ground irrelevant proof lay aside word contemplate bare ideas think youll find arent pure abstract ideas extendedness say pure intellect cant abstract ideas form faculty since cant form abstract ideas clearly impossible form help pure intellect whatever faculty mean phrase refer set aside question nature pure intellect spiritual object virtue reason god etc say much seem clearly true sensible things perceive sense represent imagination shape size dont belong pure intellect initially perceive sense want surer try see frame idea shape abstract particularities size sensible qualities let think littlei dont find well think possible something might really exist nature imply contradiction conception mean therefore since even mind cant possibly separate ideas extendedness motion sensible qualities doesnt follow former exist latter must also exist would seem consequently arguments agree decisive secondary qualities need extra help count strongly primary qualities also besides trust sense dont convince sensible qualities coexist appear sense place sense ever represent motion shape divest visible tangible qualities neednt say freely admit unless hide error oversight discussion herethat sensible qualities alike deny existence outside mind fear may free former concessions overlook fallacy line argument short didnt take time think hylas take time want go back discussion liberty repair slip make support initial opinion present arguments far overlook think big oversight part fail distinguish sufficiently object sensation sensation exist outside mind doesnt follow object either object mean object sense exactly immediately perceive right explain difference immediately perceive sensation take sensation act perceive mind beside something perceive call object act example red yellow tulip act perceive colour tulip tulip talk one see see beside colour shape extendedness nothing would say red yellow coexistent extension wouldnt yes go say real existence outside mind unthinking substance colour really tulip see obvious deny tulip may exist independently mind mine immediate object sensesthat idea combination ideasshould exist unthinking substance exterior mind obvious contradiction imagine follow say namely red yellow tulip saw since dont claim see unthinking substance skillful change subject philonous see dont want push direction let return distinction sensation object understand correctly hold every perception two things one action mind true action cant exist belong unthinking thing whatever else involve perception may position perception without act mind perception could exist unthinking substance grant impossible perception mind say active produce put end change anything mind produce discontinue change anything way except act mind count active perceptions extent volition include pluck flower active handmovement arise volition likewise hold nose either smell also act draw air nose breathe manner rather otherwise effect volition isnt smell either would smell every time breathe manner true smell result pluck hold breathe dont find involve anything pluck hold breathe whatever else happensincluding perceive smellis independent wholly passive respect different case hylas consider see isnt power open eye keep shut turn way without doubt similarly depend look flower perceive white rather colour direct open eye towards part sky avoid see sun light darkness effect volition certainly respect altogether passive tell see consist perceive light colour rather open turn eye former certainly well since actual perception light colour altogether passive become action say ingredient every sensation doesnt follow concessions perception light colourswhich doesnt involve actioncan exist unperceiving substance isnt plain contradiction dont know think furthermore since distinguish active passive elements every perception must perception pain could painhowever inactive ispossibly exist unperceiving substance think tell frankly arent light colour taste sound etc equally passions sensations mind may call external object give word whatever kind existence like examine thoughts tell whether right admit philonous look carefully go mind find think variety sensations cant conceive sensation could exist unperceiving substance hand look different way sensible things consider many properties qualities find suppose material substratum without cant conceive exist material substratum call tell please sense acquaint sensible properties qualities perceive sense presume obtain idea reflection reason dont claim proper positive idea positive mean nonrelational hylas mean doesnt idea represent material substance like conclude exist qualities cant conceive exist without support seem relative notion material substance conceive conceive relate sensible qualities right tell please relation isnt sufficiently express term substratum substance one latin mean underneath layer come latin mean stand word substratum mean spread sensible qualities true consequently spread extendedness agree nature entirely distinct extendedness tell extendedness quality matter something support qualities isnt obvious support thing different support one something distinct extendedness include suppose substratum extendedness tell hylas thing spread without extend isnt idea extendedness necessarily include spread anything suppose spread something else must extendedness distinct extendedness thing spread must consequently every bodily substance substratum extendedness must another extendedness qualify substratum extendedness must also something spread subsubstratum speak infinity isnt absurd well conflict say namely substratum something distinct extendedness include yes philonous misunderstand dont mean matter spread crude literal sense extension word substratum use express general thing substance well let us examine relation imply term substance relation stand qualities doesnt thing extend stand support another yes isnt supposition infect absurdity previous one still take things strict literal sense isnt fair philonous dont want force mean onto word free explain please please make understand something tell matter support stand accidents legs support body literal sense please let know sense literal literal understand inhow long must wait answer hylas dont know say think understand well enough mean matter support qualities think less understand short find dont know anything seem idea either positive relative matter dont know relation qualities admit yet say couldnt conceive real existence qualities without conceive time material support amount say conceive real existence qualities also conceive something cant conceive wrong admit still fear fallacy let try occur lead error treat quality grant quality exist outside mind colour cant exist without extension shape exist without sensible quality number qualities unite blend together constitute entire sensible thing obstacle suppose thingsthat collections qualitiescan exist outside mind joke hylas bad memory indeed go qualities name one another argumentsor rather concessionsnowhere tend prove secondary qualities dont exist outside mind isolation point rather secondary qualities dont exist outside mind true existinginisolation come discussion
