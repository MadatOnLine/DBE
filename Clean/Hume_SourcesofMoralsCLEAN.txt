an enquiry into the source of morals david hume source of morals david hume content the general source of morals benevolence justice political society why utility please qualities useful to ourselves qualities immediately agreeable to ourselves qualities immediately agreeable to others conclusion appendix moral sentiment or feel appendix selflove appendix further point about justice appendix some verbal dispute most of the principles and reason contain in this volume be publish in a work in three volumes call a treatise of human nature a work which the author have project before he leave college and which he write and publish soon after it wasnt a success and he come to realize that he have go to the press too early so he rework the whole thing in the follow piece in which he hop to have correct some fault in his earlier reason and more in his write the enquiry concern human understand the dissertation on the passions and the present work be publish in one volume yet several writers who have honour the author philosophy with answer have take care to aim all their gun at that juvenile work which the author have never acknowledge and have gloat over victories that they imagine they have win against it that be dishonest and unfair and a strike example of the polemical trick that a bigoted zeal think it be entitle to employ from now on the author want the follow piece to be regard as the only source for his philosophical sentiments and principles in hum day a sentiment could be a viewopinionbelief or a feel why not replace each occurrence of sentiment by belief or by feel as be appropriate in the give context for two reason hume sometimes seem to make sentiment sprawl across both its mean some things that many people regard as beliefs be in hum view really feel and with a give occurrence of sentiment its not always clear how far he mean to be show his hand just there so in this version sentiment be never replace in case whereas on page it be both sure and important that it mean feel that be indicate by the addition of or feel the general source of morals the dispute that one have with men who be stubbornly obstinate in their principles be the most tiresome of all except perhaps for the dispute with perfectly insincere people who dont really believe the opinions they defend but engage in the controversy because they enjoy it or because they want to show how much cleverer and more ingenious they be than the rest of mankind both kinds of disputant show the same blind adherence to their own arguments the same contempt for their opponents and the same emotional intensity in push their bad arguments and false doctrines neither kind get through reason the view he be defend so its no use expect to be able to move them from falsehood to truth by reason the only logic theyll be move by be the logic that speak to the feel those who have deny the reality of moral distinctions can be classify among the insincere disputants it simply isnt conceivable that any human be could ever seriously believe that all kinds of people and all kinds of behaviour be equally entitle to everyones affection and regard nature will make one man so different from another and this difference be make so much greater still by upbringing example and habit that when we compare the two men we have to be aware of how unalike they be that they be somewhat different couldnt be question by the most thorough sceptic or deny by the most confident dogmatist however numb a person be with regard to his fellow men he must often be visit by thoughts of right and wrong and however firmly wed he be to his prejudice he must be aware that the other people be also give to such thoughts so the only way to convert an antagonist of this kindie one who deny that there be moral differences between man and manis to leave him to himself when he find that nobody be will to argue with him he will probably end upout of sheer boredomcoming over to the side of common sense and reason a serious controversy have start up recentlyone that be worth engage inabout the general foundation of morals be morals derive from reason or from sentiment or feel do we get our knowledge of them by a chain of argument and induction or by an immediate feel and finer internal sense should moral opinions like all sound judgments of truth and falsehood be the same for every rational intelligent be or be they like the perception of beauty and ugliness base entirely on the particular makeup of the human species the ancient philosophers often assert that virtue be nothing but conformity to reason but their write generally suggest that they think that morals derive their existence from taste and sentiment and on the other side our modern enquirers talk a great deal about the beauty of virtue and ugliness of vice seem to imply that their basis be sentiment or feel but they have commonly try to account for the virtuevice distinction by metaphysical reason and by deductions from the most abstract principles of the understand there have be so much confusion in these subject that a really important opposition between two systems could pass unnoticeduntil recently that be the elegant lord shaftesbury who first call this distinction to our attention and who in general accept the principles of the ancients be himself not entirely free from the same confusion admittedly there be plausible arguments on both side of the question on the side of the view that moral distinctions be discernible by pure reason there be this line of think consider the many disputesin everyday life as well as in philosophyregarding morals the long chain of proof that be often produce on both side the examples cite the authorities appeal to the analogies employ the fallacies detect the inferences draw and the various conclusions tailor to fit the principles they be suppose to go with where do all this come from if morals arent in the domain of reason truth be disputable taste isnt what exist in the nature of things be the standard of our judgment what each man feel within himself be the standard of sentiment or feel a note on the two side of the contrast hume be draw here in his time judgment could stand for think that p come to the conclusion that p believe that p there be nothing specially moral about the word mean as there be for us when for example we describe someone as judgmental this be a place where sentiment clearly mean feel and not belief see note on page these two point together help to explain why this work could not have be entitle an enquiry into the source of moral judgments proposition in geometry can be prove systems in physics can be controvert but the harmony of verse the tenderness of passion the brilliancy of wit must give immediate pleasure no man reason about someone elses beauty but we often reason concern the justice or injustice of someones action in every criminal trial the prisoner aim to disprove the accusations about what he have actually do and to show that even if these action be real they could be justify as innocent and lawful everyone know that be settle by deductions of the understand how can we suppose that in settle a different faculty of the mind be employ on the other side those who hold that all moral view be matter of sentiment may say things like this it be impossible for reason ever to draw moral conclusions the essence of virtue be that it be amiable here lovable the essence of vice be that it be odious could reason or argumentation tell us which items be to be label amiable and which odioussettling in advance that this must produce love and that must produce hatred what reason can we ever give for the facts about what we love and what we hate except the basic structure of the human mind the purpose of all moral theorize be to teach us our duty and by present the ugliness of vice and the beauty of virtue to get us into the habit of avoid one and embrace the other could we ever expect to achieve that through inferences and conclusions of the understand which dont in themselves have any hold on our affections and dont set in motion our active power inferences etc reveal truths but they cant influence our behaviour because the truths they reveal be indifferent and dont create either desire or aversion here and in the next paragraph indifferent mean not involve any kind of for or against if something be honourable fair appropriate noble or generous it take possession of the heart and stir us to embrace and maintain it on the other hand if something be intelligible evident probable or true that procure only the cool assent of our understand if you extinguish all the warm feel and attitudes in favour of virtue and all disgust or aversion to vice thus make people totally indifferent towards these distinctions the result will be that morality be no longer a practical study have no tendency to regulate our live and action these arguments and many more that might be produce be so plausible that im incline to suspect that the arguments on both side be solid and satisfactory and that reason and sentiment work together in almost all moral judgments and conclusions but if i be right they enter the picture in different ways there be the final judgment which pronounce people and action amiable or odious praiseworthy or blameable stamp on them the mark of honour or infamy approval or censure render morality an active principle and make virtue our happiness and vice our misery this final moral conclusion depend on some internal sense or feel that nature have make universal in the whole species for only a feel could have an influence such as i have describe but we often find that in order to reach this sentiment or feel and to pick out accurately the thing the feel be about we have to go through much reason make fine distinctions draw sound conclusions compare things that be not greatly alike examine complicate relations and settle various factual matter some sort of beauty especially natural beauty command our affection and approval when we first see them and if something doesnt have this effect theres no way for reason to remedy the situation and make the item in question more in tune with our taste and sentiment but there be many kinds of beauty especially in the finer arts where one have to use much reason if one be to have the right feel and a wrong like for a work of art can often be correct by argument and reflection there be good reason to think that moral beauty be of the latter kind and cant get a suitable influence on the human mind unless it get help from our intellectual faculties but although this question about which of our faculties be at work in morals be challenge and important i dont need to go into it any further here what i do want to do in this enquiry be to discover the true origin of morals if i have the good fortune to succeed in that it wont be hard to see how far either sentiment or reason enter into all our moral judgment ill return to that in appendix to achieve my purpose ill try to follow a very simple method i shall analyse the complex of mental qualities that we commonly call personal merit i shall consider every attribute of mind that make a man an object either of respect and affection or of hatred and contempt every habit or sentiment or ability which if ascribe to any person imply either praise or blame everyone be alert to this difference so i be pretty sure that i wont ever go seriously wrong in draw up my list put any item that i be think about into the wrong list all i need do be to look into myself for a moment and consider whether i would want to have this or that quality ascribe to me and whether if it be ascribe to me that would come from a friend or from an enemy the very nature of language guide us almost infallibly in form a judgment of this kind every language contain one set of word that be understand as approve and another set that be understand as disapprove and a quite casual acquaintance with the idiom enable us to collect and arrange the list of estimable and of blameable qualities of men without have to reason about what we be do the only role of reason in this matter be to discover what be in common to the attribute that bring approval and what be common to all that bring disapproval and on that basis to reach the foundation of ethics and find the universal source from which all blame or approval be ultimately derive as this be a question of fact not of abstract theory the only way we can expect to succeed be by follow the experimental method derive general maxims from a comparison of particular instance the other scientific method in which a general abstract principle be first establish and then a variety of inferences and conclusions be draw from it may be intrinsically better but it isnt as well suit to the imperfection of human nature and be a common source of illusion and error in morals as well as in other subject men be now cure of their passion for hypotheses and systems in natural philosophy natural science and wont listen to any arguments that arent derive from experience its high time they try a similar reformation in all moral proceed and reject every system of ethics however subtle or ingenious that isnt base on fact and observation i shall begin my enquiry by consider the social virtues benevolence and justice get clear about them will probably give us an open through which the other virtues can be account for benevolence how benevolence be value you may well think that there be no need to show that the benevolent or softer affections be estimable and always attract the approval and goodwill of mankind all languages have equivalents of the word sociable goodnatured humane merciful grateful friendly generous and beneficent and such word always express the highest merit that human nature can attain when these amiable qualities be accompany by noble birth and power and distinguish abilities and display themselves in the good government or useful instruction of mankind they seem even to raise the possessors of them above the rank of human nature make them somewhat approach the status of divine great ability undaunted courage tremendous successthese may expose a hero or politician to the publics envy and illwill but as soon as humane and beneficent be add to the praiseswhen instance be display of mercy gentleness or friendshipenvy itself be silent or join in with the general voice of approval and applause when pericles the great athenian statesman and general be on his deathbed his surround friendsthinking he be unconsciousbegan to express their sorrow by list their die patrons great qualities and successes his conquests and victories his unusually long time in power and his nine trophies erect to celebrate victories over the enemies of the republic in fact the die hero be conscious hear all of this and join in you be forget the highest of my praise while dwell on those common advantage in which luck have a principal share you havent observe that no citizen ever wear mourn because of me in men of more ordinary talents and abilities the social virtues become if possible still more essentially need if a person be to be regard with approval because in that case there be no high distinction to compensate for any lack of social virtues or to preserve the person from our severest hatred as well as contempt cicero have write that high ambition and great courage be apt in less perfect character to degenerate into a turbulent ferocity what such less perfect people mainly need be the softer and more social virtues which be good and amiable in anyone who have them accord to the latin writer venal what be chiefly good about someones have great power and abilities be that this make his benevolence more extensive give him greater opportunities to spread his kindly influence than lesser men have let us face it the only way a man can truly enjoy the advantage of be distinguish in other ways be by do good his high position in itself merely expose him to danger and tempest his only real privilege be his ability to provide shelter to inferiors who entrust themselves to his cover and protection but im forget that its not my present business to recommend generosity and benevolence or to paint in their true colour all the genuine charm of the social virtues these virtues sufficiently engage every heart when they be first understand and its hard not to break out in praise of them whenever they crop up in discourse or reason but my object here be the theoretical rather than the practical part of morals so ill just say this expect everyone to agree no qualities be more entitle to the general goodwill and approval of mankind than beneficence and humanity friendship and gratitude natural affection and public spirit or anything that come from a tender sympathy with others and a generous concern for mankind in general whenever these appear they seem to inject themselves so to speak into each beholder cause him to have some of these the same favourable and affectionate sentiments throughout this work hume use sympathy in its basic original sense of fellowfeeling in this sense of the word i can have sympathy with you in your happiness orsee contagion and sympathy on page be irritable in sympathy with your bad temper benevolence and utility when we be praise a humane and beneficent man we always emphasize the happiness and satisfaction that society get from his good work we be apt to say that he be dear to his parent not only because of the tie of blood but also and more because of his pious attachment to them and his dutiful care for them his children never feel his authority except when it be exert for their benefit with him the tie of love be consolidate by beneficence and friendship the tie of friendship approach those of love and inclination because of the spirit in which he do good things for his friends for his servants and dependents he be a sure resource and they no longer dread the power of fortune except insofar as it concern his welfare from him the hungry receive food the naked receive clothe the ignorant or lazy receive skill and work he be like the sun in be an inferior minister subordinate agent of providence he cheer invigorate and sustain the world around him if he be confine to private life his sphere of activity be smaller but his influence be all benign and gentle if he be exalt into a higher position mankind and posterity reap the fruit of his labour these modes of praise be always employ and with success when we want to inspire esteem for someone cant we infer from this that the utility result from the social virtuesthe good that be do under their influence be at least a part of their merit and be one source of the approval and respect that everyone give to them when we recommend even an animal or a plant as useful and beneficial we applaud and praise it in a manner suit to its nature just as on the other hand when we think about the harmful influence of any kind of plant or animal this always create in us a sentiment or feel of aversion the eye be please with the view of cornfields and load vineyards horse graze and flock pasture but it avoid the view of briars and brambles that provide shelter for wolves and snake if a machine or piece of furniture or article of clothe or house be well design for use and convenience to that extent it be beautiful and be contemplate with pleasure and approval with this kind of thing an experience eye will detect many excellences that ignorant and uninstructed people would miss can anything stronger be say in praise of an occupationsuch as merchandise or manufacture than to point out the good it do for society and wont a monk or an inquisitor be enrage if we treat his religious organisation as useless or harmful to mankind the historian rejoice in display the benefit arise from his labour the writer of romance do what he can to lessen or deny the bad consequences that be ascribe to the kind of thing he write in general what praise be imply in the simple epithet useful what reproach in the contrary cicero in opposition to the epicureans say your gods be not entitle to any worship or adoration whatever imaginary perfections you endow them with they be totally useless and inactive even the egyptians whom you so much ridicule never treat any animal as sacred except on account of its utility the sceptics assert that the all religious worship originate from the utility of inanimate object such as the sun and moon to the support and wellbeing of mankind this be an absurd theory of the origin of religion but its sheer existence support my thesis about the central place of utility doinggood bringingbenefit to our approval and admiration this be also the reason that historians commonly give for the deification of eminent heroes and legislators to plant a tree to cultivate a field to beget children these be all meritorious act accord to the religion of zoroaster empirical evidence of failures of benevolence in moral judgments this matter of public utility be always centrally in view and whenever everyday or philosophical dispute arise concern the limit of duty by far the most certain way of settle the dispute question be to ascertain how each side of it relate to the true interest of mankind if we find that a misread of the evidence have lead us to accept a false opinion about human interest as soon as further experience and sounder reason have give us a more correct view of the facts we retract our first sentiment and readjust the line between moral good and evil here be four examples of this kind of shift in moral opinion give alms to common beggar be naturally praise because it seem to bring relief to those who be poor and distress but when we see that almsgiving encourage idleness and debauchery we regard that kind of charity as a weakness rather than a virtue tyrannicide ie the assassination of usurpers and oppressive rulers be highly praise in ancient time because it free mankind from many of these monsters and seem to keep in awe other rulers who couldnt be reach by the sword or the dagger but history and experience have since convince us that this practice make rulers more suspicious and cruel so that a tiberius and a brutes two highminded killers of their rulers though treat with indulgence because of the prejudice of their time be now regard as not people to imitate generosity in rulers be regard as a sign of beneficence but when it have the result that the homely bread of honest and hardworking people be often convert into luxuryfoods for wasteful idlers we soon retract our thoughtless praise the regret of a monarch for have lose a day be noble and generous but if he have intend to spend the day in act of generosity to his greedy courtiers it be better lose than misuse in that way luxury or a refinement on the pleasures and conveniences of life have for a long time be regard as the source of every corruption in government and the ultimate cause of faction sedition civil war and the total loss of liberty hume write the immediate cause etc presumably a slip so it be see by everyone as a vice and be attack by all satirists and severe moralists those who show or try to show that such refinements tend to increase industry civility and arts be offer new rule for our moral as well as our political sentiments represent as praiseworthy or at least as innocent behaviour that have formerly be regard as harmful and blameable this refer to mandevilles fable of the be private vices public benefit take all of this together it seem undeniable that nothing can bestow more merit on any person that his have a very high degree of the sentiment of benevolence and that at least a part of the merit of this sentiment come from its probable consequences for the interest of our species and the happiness of human society when we think about a benevolent person we carry our view of his character and disposition forward to their good consequences and we look with satisfaction and pleasure at anything that have such a benign influence and contribute to such a desirable end the social virtues be never view as barren and unfruitful we always think of them along with their beneficial tendencies see their gentle reign over the hearts of men as a cause of the happiness of mankind the order of society the harmony of families the mutual support of friends how much of their merit ought we to ascribe to their utility ill be better place to answer that when some other things have be deal with section and why do the good consequences of the social virtues have such a command over our esteem and approval i shall address that in justice the proposition that justice be useful to society and thus at least part of its merit must come from that fact doesnt need to be argue for because it be so obviously true not so the proposition that public utility be the sole origin of justice and thoughts about its beneficial consequences be the sole basis for its merit this proposition be more challenge and important so it better deserve to be look into with care justice and abundance let suppose that nature have give the human race such a profuse abundance of all external conveniences that all of us without any care or industry on our part can be confident that we be fully supply with whatever our hungriest appetites can want or our most luxurious imagination can wish or desire let us suppose that man be so situate that his natural beauty surpass all acquire ornament the perpetual mildness of the season make clothe unnecessary raw fruit and vegetables provide delicious food the clear fountain provide the richest beverage no hard work be neededno plough no navigation music poetry and meditate be his only business conversation fun and friendship be his sole amusement it seem clear that in such a happy state every other social virtue would flourish and be increase tenfold but the cautious jealous virtue of justice would never once have be dream of what point would there be in divide up goods when everyone already have more than enough why institute property when there cant possibly be any harm in not do so why call this object mine when just by stretch out my hand i could get another one that be like it and equally valuable in this state of affairs justice would be totally useless it would be an idle ceremonial have no place in the list of virtues even in the present needy condition of mankind we see that wherever any benefit be bestow by nature in an unlimited abundance we leave it in common among the whole human race not divide it up in term of right and property water and air though more need than anything else be not claim as the property of individuals and noone can commit an injustice by the most lavish use and enjoyment of these bless in large fertile countries with few inhabitants land be see in the same way and those who defend the liberty of the seas have as their principal theme the unexhausted use of them in navigationie the fact that however many ship there be the worlds oceans dont get use up if the benefit of navigation such as trade and treasurefinding be equally inexhaustible those defenders of the liberty of the seas would never have any opponents and no nation would ever have claim a separate exclusive dominion over some part of the ocean it can happen in some countries at some time that there be ownership of water but not of land see genesis and that happen if there be more land than the inhabitants can use and water be scarce and hard to find justice and benevolence here be a second supposition let us suppose that the human race while have the same need and shortages that it actually have have a mind that be so enlarge so full of friendship and generosity that each man have the utmost concern for every man feel no more concern for his own interest than for the interest of his fellows it seem obvious that this extensive benevolence would cancel the use of justice and the divisions and barriers of property and obligation would never be think of why should i want a contract or a promise to bind someone else to do me some good when i know that he already have the strongest inclination to seek my happiness and would unprompted perform the desire service what if his perform it would cause a greater loss to him than the benefit he would be bring to you in that case he know that my innate humanity and friendship will cause me to be the first to oppose this imprudent generosity why place boundarymarkers between my neighbour field and mine when my heart have make no division between my interest and his and share all his joy and sorrow with the same force and vivacity as if they be originally my own that be if they have begin as my own rather than become mine because my neighbour have them and i have a tender heart in this suppose state of affairs every man be a second self to another hume presumably mean to every other and would trust all his interest to the discretion of every man without jealousy without partition and without distinguish one person from another the whole human race would constitute a single family in which everything would be hold in common and be use freely without regard to property but cautiously too with as much concern for the need of each individual as if our own interest be intimately concern give what the human heart be actually like it might be hard to find complete examples of such enlarge affections but we may see approximations to it in families and in any group the stronger the mutual benevolence be among the individuals the nearer the group come to the noneedforjustice condition until all distinctions of property be in a great measure lose and mix up among them the laws presume that the cement of friendship between a marry couple be so strong as to abolish all division of possessions and in many case it actually be as strong as that and its a matter of empirical fact that during the ardour of new enthusiasms when every principle see note on title page be heat up into its most extreme form reformers have frequently try to abolish property ie have community of goods and what have lead the imprudent fanatics to change course and restore the ideas of justice and of separate propertythe only thing that could get them to do thisis their experience of the drawbacks that the noproperty system have because of the selfishness of men who hide their selfishness during the revolution or return to be selfish after the revolutionary fuss have die down thats a measure of how true it be that the virtue of justice derive its existence entirely from the need things that it do for human interactions and the social state of mankind justice and scarcity to make this truth more obvious let us reverse the suppositions we have be make take everything to the opposite extreme and see what effect that would have in each case suppose a society suffer such a lack of all common necessities that even with the utmost frugality and industry most of them will die prematurely and everyone live in extreme misery i think you will readily agree that in such a press emergency the strict laws of justice will be suspend be dislodge by the stronger motives of necessity and selfpreservation when a sailor whose ship be go down be in the water be it a crime for him to seize whatever he can to keep him afloat without regard to whose property it isor be if a besiege city be starve to death can we imagine that any citizen will see a mean of preservation within his reach and not take it lose his life because of his scrupulous regard for what in other situations would be the rule of property and justice what that virtue be for and what it tend to produce be happiness and security through the preservation of order in society but when a society be on the brink of perish from extreme necessity there be no greater evil to be fear from violence and injustice and every man may now provide for himself by any mean that prudence dictate and humanity permit even in case of need that be less drastic than the one we have be suppose the government open granaries without the consent of their owners on the correct assumption that the authority of the law can stretch that far as long as it do so in a fair way well if any number of men come together without the tie of laws or civil jurisdiction and suffer a famine would it be regard as criminal or injurious to divide up the available food equally if this be do through power and even violence justice and malevolence a few line down hume be probably use contempt in a less active sense than we give the word today in this milder sense to have contempt for something be to regard it as negligible to treat as of no accountthus many people contempt for order a soldier contempt for pain most occurrences of contempt in this work do use it in our stronger or more active sense now suppose that a virtuous man have the bad luck to fall into the society of ruffians far remove from the protection of laws and government how be he to behave in that miserable situation he see such ruthless and violent greed prevail such a disregard for fairness such contempt for social order such stupid blindness to future consequences that it be bind to have the most tragic conclusiondeath for the majority and total dissolution of this society for the rest the question be what should he do all he can do be to arm himself no matter whose sword or shield it be that he snatch up so as to provide himself with all possible mean of selfdefence and security his personal concern for justice be no longer any use for his own safety or anyone elses so he must consult the dictate of selfpreservation alone without concern for those who no longer deserve his care and attention the rule of justice can also be rightly suspend in a politically organize society when any man commit crimes that make him obnoxious to the public he be punish by the laws in his goods fin and in his person imprisonment or physical punishment this mean that the ordinary rule of justice be briefly suspend with regard to him and it become fair to inflict on him for the benefit of society things it would be wrong or injurious to inflict on him otherwise if it werent for this suspension punishment would always be wrong think about the rage and violence of a public wareg a war between two countries what be it but a suspension of justice among the war party who see that this virtue be now no longer of any use or advantage to them the laws of war which then take over from the laws of equity and justice be rule calculate to do good and be useful for men who be in that particular state they be now place in namely the state of war if a civilize nation be at war with barbarians who dont even respect any rule of war the former must also suspend their observance of any such rule because they no longer serve any purpose and they must make every battle or skirmish as bloody and destructive as possible to the barbarians whom we may suppose to have be the first aggressors thus the rule of equity or justice depend entirely on the particular state and condition in which men be place what start them and keep them in existence be their usefulness the utility that come to the public from their strict and regular observance if you reverse in any significant way the condition of menproduce extreme abundance or extreme need endow humans with perfect moderation and humanity or perfect rapacity and maliceyou make justice entirely useless totally destroy its essence and suspend its obligation on mankind the usual state of human affairs be a medium amidst all these extremes we be naturally partial to ourselves and our friends but be capable of learn the advantage result from a more equitable conduct few enjoyments be give us directly from the open and liberal hand of nature but by skill and hard work we can extract them in great abundance that be why the ideas of property become necessary in all civil society it be why justice be useful to the public and that be the sole source of its merit and moral obligation the golden age these conclusions be so natural and obvious that even the poets have notice them in their descriptions of the happiness of the golden age celebrate by ancient greek poets accord to those pleasant fictions the season in that first period of nature be so temperate that men didnt need clothe or house to guard against the violence of heat and cold the rivers flow with wine and milk the oaks yield honey nature spontaneously produce her greatest delicacies and that wasnt the best of it in that happy age not only be tempests remove from nature but the more violent inner tempests that now cause such uproar and create such confusion be unknown to human breast avarice ambition cruelty selfishness be never hear of the only state of mind that anyone have be cordial affection compassion and sympathy even the carefully correct distinction of mine and thine be banish from the human scene and take with it the very notions of property and obligation justice and injustice the state of nature this poetic fiction of the golden age be in some ways comparable with the philosophical fiction of the state of nature except that the former be represent as the most charm and peaceable condition that can possibly be imagine whereas the latter be depict as a state of mutual war and violence accompany by extreme need at the outset we be tell mankinds ignorance and savage nature be so prevalent that they couldnt trust one another each have to depend on himself and his own force or cunning for protection and security no law be hear of no rule of justice know no right of ownership respect the only measure of right be power and a perpetual war of all against all be the result of mens untamed selfishness and barbarity whether such a condition of human nature could exist and whether if it do it could for long deserve to be call a state be doubtful men be necessarily bear into a familysociety at least and be bring up by their parent to observe some rule of conduct and behaviour but it cant be deny that if such a state of mutual war and violence be ever real it would inevitably involve the suspension of all laws of justice because they couldnt do any possible good the more we look into human life from different angle and the newer and more unusual the light be in which we survey it the more well be convince that this account of the virtue of justice be realistic and satisfactory justice and the lesser breed here be a supposition of a quite different kind from the earlier ones suppose this to be the case mix in among mankind be creatures of a different species which though rational be so much weaker in body and mind than human be be that they cant stand up to us and can never however greatly provoke make us feel the effect of their resentment if this come true i think that we would be bind by the laws of humanity to treat these creatures gently but we wouldnt strictly speak lie under any restraint of justice with regard to them and they couldnt have any property or other right in relation to us though they might have them in relation to one another our relationships with them couldnt be call society a label that imply some degree of equality what there would be instead be absolute command on one side and servile obedience on the other if we want something they must immediately hand it over the only basis there be for them to own anything be our permit them to the this fiction of a state of nature as a state of war wasnt first invent by hobbes as be commonly imagine plato try to refute an hypothesis very like it in republic book whereas cicero treat it as common knowledge and certainly correct you cant not know that in the natural course of events before there be any natural or civil law fully lay down men wander in disorderly rabbles over the countryside and own only what they could seize and keep through wound and bloodshed by their own personal strength this lead the best and wisest men have consider what men be naturally like and how far they can be teach anything to bring together in one place those who have previously be scatter abroad and to lead them out of their savage way of life into one in which there be justice and gentleness the next step be to form the constitutions devise for human use that we call commonwealths then there be larger collections of men that come to be call state and then men build wall around set of house that we now call cities and divine and human laws begin to be recognise the biggest single difference between this manner of life polish by civilization and the savage one that come first be the fact that law be the rule principle of the one whereas violence dominate the other if we dont want to be guide by law we must settle for violence and if we want to put an end to violence well have to allow law to prevailie to allow court of justice to prevail because they contain within themselves all law and justice if we turn against court of justice or they be destroy or suspend violence will take over everyone see this cicero pro sestio this be a small episode in a very long defence speech to the roman senate which be sit as a court of law ciceros client be acquit only barrier they have to our lawless willlawless that be in relation to themis our compassion and kindness well never suffer any inconvenience from the exercise of our power over them a power that be so firmly establish in nature so the restraints of justice and property would be totally useless for us and would therefore never have a place in this unequal relationship this be clearly how men be situate in relation to animals be they rational ill leave that for others to determine the great superiority of civilize europeans over barbarous indians tempt us to think we relate to them as we do to the animals and lead us to throw off all restraints of justice and even of humanity in our treatment of them in many nations females be reduce to a similar slavery and be deny any right of property in relation to their lordly master but although the males when they combine force have in all countries enough bodily force to maintain this severe tyranny their fair companion have so much subtlety skill and charm that they be commonly able to break up the confederacy among the males and then share with them all the right and privilege of society now look at another sequence of suppositions suppose the human species be so build by nature that each individual have within himself everything need for his own preservation and for the propagation of his kind and that all society and all interactions between man and man be cut off by the primary intention of the supreme creator it seem obvious that such a solitary be would be no more capable of justice or injustice than he would be of social discourse and conversation if mutual respect and forbearance didnt achieve anything they would never guide the behaviour of any reasonable man the headlong rush of the emotions wouldnt be check by any reflection on future consequences and as each man would love himself alone and depend only on himself and his own activity for safety and happiness he would always do his very best to claim preference over every other be because he wouldnt be link to any of them by any tie of nature or of selfinterest now vary this last supposition of the solitariness of every human be by suppose that the conjunction of the sex be establish in nature that immediately give rise to families particular rule will be find to be necessary if it be to survive so these will be immediately accept as apply within each family though not as between any family and people outside it now suppose that a number of families unite to form a single society that have no link with any others in that case the rule preserve peace and order will extend themselves right out to the boundaries of society at any distance beyond those boundaries they will have no force because they wont do any good but then finally suppose that many distinct societies interact with one another for mutual convenience and advantage then the boundaries of justice still extend still wider in proportion to the breadth of mens view and the strength of their interconnections history experience and reason sufficiently instruct us in this natural development of human sentiments and in the gradual broaden of our view about the scope of justice in proportion as we come to know more about the utility of that virtue if we examine the particular laws by which justice be direct and property determine well still reach the same conclusion the only object of all these laws and regulations be the good of mankind its not just that the peace and interest of society require that there be an institution of individual ownership the actual rule by which we sort out the detail of what be mine and what be yours be themselves devise to serve as well as possible the further interest of society let us suppose that a creature who have reason but no experience of human nature be mull over the question of what rule of justice or property would best promote public interest and establish peace and security among mankind his most obvious think would be this give the largest possessions to those with the most virtue and give everyone a power of do good that be proportional to his want to do good this rule might be appropriatemight lead to the best resultsin a perfect theocracy in which everything happen through the particular volitions of an infinitely intelligent be but if mere mankind adopt such a law it couldnt be cleanly apply because merit be so uncertain the immediate result would be the total dissolution of society why be merit uncertain because it be naturally obscure and also because each individual overrate his own merit fanatics may think they be entitle to help themselves to others property because dominion be base on grace and saint alone inherit the earth but the law of the land rightly treat these highflying theorists as be on a par with common robbers and teach them by the severest discipline that a rule that seem in theory to be advantageous to society may be find in practice to be totally harmful and destructive history tell us that there be religious fanatics of this kind in england during the civil war though the obvious tendency towards chaos of these principles probably create so much horror in people that these dangerous wouldbe reformers felt compel to renounce or at least conceal their view perhaps the levellers who want all property to be distribute equally be a kind of political fanatics an offshoot of the religious ones they be more open about their view than the saintsaloneinherittheearth people because their view seem more capable of be put into practice as well as be more useful to human society there be indeed several sound things to be say in defence of the levellers nature be so generous towards mankind that if all her gift be evenly divide among our species and improve by skill and work every individual would enjoy all the necessities and most of the comfort of life and wouldnt be liable to any misfortunes except ones derive from physical illness whenever we depart from this equality we rob the poor of more satisfaction than we add to the rich the slight gratification of a frivolous vanity in one individual often cost more than bread to many families and even provinces the rule of equality as well as be potentially very useful isnt altogether impracticable it have actually be follow at least partially in some republics especially that of sparta where it be say to have be accompany by the most beneficial consequences and then there be the agrarian laws so often push for in rome and actually carry out in many greek cities those laws all come from a general idea of the good consequences the utility of the level principle but historians tell usand common sense agreesthat however attractive these ideas of perfect equality may be they be basically not practicable and if they could be and be put into practice their consequences would be extremely harmful to human society however equally possessions be divide up mens different degrees of skill care and industry will immediately break the equality and if you try to avoid this by put constraints on skill care and industry youll reduce society to extreme poverty instead of prevent want and beggary in a few people youll be make it unavoidable for the whole community also to spot any inequality the moment it show up there would have to be a rigorous monitor system and to punish and correct it there would have to be a very severe penal system that much authority would be sure to degenerate into tyranny and to be exercise in unfair ways butmore to the pointnobody could possibly have such authority in a society such as the levellers want perfect equality of possessions would destroy all subordination thereby greatly weaken the authority of officer of the law as well as level out property it would pretty well level out power what we can conclude from all this be that in order to establish laws for the regulation of property we must be acquaint with the nature and situation of man not be take in by mislead facts about what seem to be the case and search for the rule that be overall the most useful and beneficial to get this right one doesnt need to look very deeply into the human condition or to have a very broad experience of it but one do need to avoid be too selfish on the one hand or too uncritically egalitarian on the other as an example of how basically easy it be to get the right answer anyone can see that something produce or improve by a man skill or labour ought to be permanently his social benefit encourage such useful habit and accomplishments that his property ought to be inherit by his children and relations social purpose the same that he can consent to make it the property of someone else social purpose create the commerce and other interactions that be so beneficial to human society and that all contract and promise ought to be carefully fulfil social purpose to secure the mutual trust and confidence that do so much to promote the general interest of mankind in each case i be talk about the social purpose of have that rule about property not of act in that way in an individual case study the writers on the laws of nature and youll find that whatever principles they set out with they be sure to end up with the one i have be defend they all give as the ultimate reason for every rule that they lay down the convenience and necessities of mankind that be the most convince kind of support to havethe support of someone who be try to oppose ones view indeed what other reason could writers ever give for hold that this be mine and that be yours since nature leave to itself surely never make any such distinction the things label mine and yours be in themselves quite other than us they be totally separate from us and nothing but the general interest of society can form the connection it can happen that the interest of society require that there be some rule of justice in a particular kind of case but dont pick any particular rule out of several that be all equally beneficial when that happen the slightest analogies be lay hold of as a basis for select one rule over the others because there would be perpetual conflict if no selection be make and several rule be regard as be in force thats why your sheerly possessingbeing the first to possesssomething be suppose to make it yours if noone else have any prior claim to it many of the reason of lawyers be of this analogical nature and depend on very slight connections of the imagination what analogy be at work in the firstpossession rule in hum time analogy often mean merely similarity and his think here seem to be that have x physically under your control be superficially like legitimately own x do anyone hesitate in extraordinary case to violate all respect for the private property of individuals and sacrifice to public interest a distinction that be establish in the first place for the sake of that interest the safety of the people be the supreme law all other more special laws be subordinate to it and dependent on it and if in the common course of things those laws be follow and respect that be only because the public safety and interest commonly demand that society be govern in a way that be evenhanded and fair sometimes both utility and analogy fail and leave the laws of justice in total uncertainty we need to have a rule accord to which your have be in possession of something for a long time make you the rightful owner of it and we get that far through reason about utility and analogy but sheer reason wont take us any further ie it wont determine how many days months or years constitute a long time be for purpose of this rule in this case civil laws have to do what be not do by the natural code they assign different value of long time for different kinds of things that can be own depend on the different utilities that the legislator be concern about hum actual word here be accord to the different utilities propose by the legislator this have be announce as a case where utility and analogy fail perhaps he mean that here the rule be settle on the basis not of facts about utility but rather of what a legislator think about utility all question of property fall under the authority of civil laws which extend restrain modify and alter the rule of natural justice accord to the convenience of each community in particular the laws do or should constantly reflect the constitution of government the manners the climate the religion the commerce and the situation of each society a recent learn and able author have pursue this subject at great length and have grow from these seed a complete philosophy of politics with many ingenious and brilliant thoughts and some substance i be refer to montesquieu the author of lesprit des loix which appear in three years before the present work this illustrious writer start off from a different theory from mine take all right to be base on certain relations rapports he mean that accord to montesquieu all moral truths can be deduce from objective facts about how things relate to one another in my opinion this be a system that will never be reconcile with true philosophy malebranche seem to have be the first proponent of this abstract theory of morals which be afterwards adopt by cudworth clarke and others because it leave out all sentiment or feel and claim to base everything on reason it have have plenty of followers in this philosophic age see my and appendix with regard to justiceour present topicthe case against this theory seem short and conclusive property depend on civil laws the sole purpose of civil laws be to secure the interest of society therefore the interest of society be the sole foundation of property and justice hume say that each premise be allow and that the conclusion must be allow presumably he mean in each case allow by montesquieu not to mention the fact that the interest of society provide the whole basis for our be oblige to obey the civil law two further considerations it sometimes happen that the way the civil law handle something clash with our ideas of justice case where this happen be not objections to my theory they be confirmations of it when a civil law be so perverse that it go against all the interest of society it lose all its authority and then men judge by the ideas of natural justice which be in line with those interest sometimes the civil laws for good reason require that a certain kind of performance involve a ceremony or a special form when that be lack the civil law say that from a legal point of view the performance hasnt happen this decree of the law run contrary to our usual ideas of justice and those ideas remain at work in a case like this someone who take advantage of such legal technicalities be usually regard as dishonest thus the interest of society require that contract be fulfil and this be as basic as you can get in both natural and civil justice but the omission of a trivial detaileg the contract be date as well as signedwill often invalidate a contract as a matter of public law but it wont invalidate it in the court of conscience in a case of this sort we take it that the judge be withdraw his power of enforce the right that be mean to arise from the contract not declare that there isnt such a right what be a man property anything that it be lawful for him and only him to use what rule do we have for pick out these object here we must have resort to statutes customs precedents analogies and a hundred other thingssome of them constant and inflexible others variable and arbitrary matter of choice but what they be all root in be the interest and happiness of human society if we leave that out of account nothing could appear more whimsical unnatural and even superstitious than most of the laws of justice and of property justice and superstition it be a very easy task to ridicule simpleminded superstitions and expose the folly of special attitudes to foods days place posture clothe all you need do be to consider all the qualities and relations of the object in question and discover no adequate cause for the affection or antipathy veneration or horror that have such a great influence over a large part of mankind a syrian would starve rather than taste pigeon an egyptian wont come near bacon but when these foods be examine by the sense of sight smell or taste or study through the sciences of chemistry medicine or physics no difference be ever find between them and any other kind of meat no factual basis be ever find for the religious passion a fowl on thursday be lawful food on friday its abominable egg in this house and in this diocese be permit during lend just down the road eat them be a damnable sin yesterday there be nothing religious about this plot of land or this build today the mumble of certain word have make it holy and sacred when a philosopher point these things out its safe to say that he wont make any difference to anyone the facts be so obvious that everyone must have notice them at first sight when they dont prevail that isnt because people dont know the facts or have misunderstand them somehow its because of people upbringing prejudice and passion someone who doesnt look carefully enough or who be think at too a high a level of generality might come to think that a similar superstition be involve in all the sentiments see note on page of justice and that if we take the focus of justicenamely what we call propertyand subject it to the same scrutiny of sense and science we wont find however hard we look any foundation for the distinctions draw by moral sentiment it be lawful for me to eat fruit from this tree but it would be a crime for me to take fruit of the same kind from a tree a few yards away if i have be dress like this an hour ago i would have deserve the severest punishment but a man have pronounce a few magical syllables and thereby make it proper for me to be clothe in this way if this house be in the neighbour territory it would have be immoral for me to live in it but because it be build on this side of the river it be subject to a different municipal law and i incur no blame or censure by come to own it it may be think then that the kind of reason that so successfully expose superstition can also be apply to justice and that its no more possible with justice than with superstition to pick out the precise feature of the object that be the basis for the sentiment but theres this solid difference superstition be frivolous useless and burdensome whereas justice be absolutely necessary for the wellbeing of mankind and the existence of society when we set this fact aside we couldnt overlook itits too obvious for that it have to be agree that all respect for right and property seem to be entirely without foundation as much so as the grossest and most vulgar superstition why do that man make certain sound imply consent change the nature of my action with regard to this object why do the recite of a liturgy by a priest dress in a certain way and hold his body in a certain way make a heap of brick and timber forever sacred if the interest of society werent involve in any way the former question would be an unanswerable as the latter these reflections dont weaken the obligations of justice or take anything away from the most sacred attention to property on the contrary such sentiments get new force from my reason what stronger foundation can be desiredor even conceivedfor any duty than to observe that if it isnt establish human society or even human nature will collapse and that our nature and society will arrive at still greater degrees of happiness and perfection to the extent that the duty in question be regard as inviolable justice as an instinct the dilemma seem obvious justice obviously tend to promote public utility and to support civil society the obviously the will or consent alone never transfer property or create the obligation of a promise for the will to impose an obligation on any man it must be express by word or sign the word initially come in as subservient to the will but before long they become the principal part of the promise and a man who secretly intend not to keep his promise and withhold the assent of his mind isnt any less bind by the promise but though in most case the expression be the whole promise it isnt always so someone who utter the word without know their mean wouldnt have make a bind promise someone who know what the word mean and utter them only as a joke give clear sign that he have no serious intention of bind himself wouldnt be oblige to keep the promise but for this to hold good the clear sign mustnt be ones that we cleverly detect while the man be try to deceive us for him not to be bind by a verbal promise he must give sign different from sign of deceit that he doesnt intend to keep the promise all these contradictions be easily account for if justice arise entirely from its public utility its usefulness to society theyll never be explain on any other basis in the next sentence a casuist be someone who apply general moral and religious doctrines to particular case a relax casuist be one who cut corner and stretch point in do this it be remarkable that the moral decisions of the jesuits and other relax casuists be usually make in the course of deal with subtleties of reason such as i have be point out why have the indignation of mankind rise so high against these casuists it can only be because everyone see that if the practice the casuists be try to rule out be authorize human society couldnt survive and that morals should always be handle with a view to public interest rather than to the demand of highlevel finegrained philosophical theories of morals any sensible person can have the think if the secret direction of the intention can invalidate a contract where be our security but someone come at this from an abstract metaphysical point of view might think that where an intention be suppose to be requisite if it really wasnt there then no consequence ought to followno obligation would be impose the casuistical subtleties may not be greater than the subtleties of lawyers that i have hint at above but they meet with very different receptions from the world because the former be pernicious while the latter be innocent and even necessary the roman catholic church teach that any sacrament can be invalidate by the frame of mind of the officiate priest this position come from rigorously follow through the seem consequences of the obvious truth that empty word alone without any mean or intention in the speaker can never have any effect the analogous position in civil laws would be that any civil contract can be nullify by the frame of mind of one of the party to it what be at stake in be the eternal salvation of thousands of people whereas whats at stake in be merely the upset of civil society so why do we not follow the church lead in by accept regard civil contract our rejection of come entirely from our sense of the danger and inconvenience that would ensue from accept it this give us a clear example of the fact that however positive arrogant and dogmatic any superstition may appear to be it can never thoroughly convince anyone that its threats be real or get anyone to give them any weight at all when balance against the common incidents of life that we learn from daily observation and empirical think sentiment of justice could be derive from our reflect on that tendency the only alternative be that the sentiment of justicelike hunger thirst and other appetites and like resentment love of life attachment to offspring and other passions arise from a simple basic instinct in the human constitution implant there by nature for similar salutary purpose if be the case it follow that propertywhich be what justice be aboutis mark off by a simple basic instinct and be not ascertain by any argument or reflection but who ever hear of such an instinct perhaps we have it but it hasnt yet be discover that be obviously wrong this be not a subject in which new discoveries can be make we would have as much chance of discover in the human body a new sense that noone have notice before and theres another point it look like a very simple proposition to say that nature distinguish property through an instinctive sentiment but in reality well find that there would have to be ten thousand different instincts many of them concern with object have great finegrained intricacy for when a definition of property be require the ownership relation be find to break down into possession acquire by occupation by industry by prescription by inheritance by contract and so on be it believable that nature through a basic instinct instruct us in all these methods of acquisition also the word inheritance and contract stand for ideas that be infinitely complicate a hundred volumes of laws and a thousand volumes of commentators havent be find sufficient to define them exactly do nature whose instincts in men be all simple embrace such complicate and artificial object and this be a different point do nature create a rational creature without trust anything to the operation of his reason even if all those difficulties be overcome the basic instinct theory of justice still wouldnt be satisfactory manmade laws can certainly transfer property must we say that it be by another basic instinct that we acknowledge the authority of kings and senates and mark all the boundaries of their jurisdiction judge too even when their sentence be wrong and illegal must be allow for the sake of peace and order to have decisive authority and ultimately to determine who own what do we have basic innate ideas of magistrates and chancellors and juries isnt it obvious that all these institutions arise merely from the necessities of human society all bird of the same species build their nest alike at every time and in every country thats the force of instinct at work men build their house differently at different time and in different place that show the influence of reason and custom a similar inference can be draw from a comparison of the sexual instinct with the institution of property that be the contrast between the sameness of the nest of any one species of bird and the variety among human house be comparable with the contrast between the sameness of human sexual feel and conduct around the world and across the age and the variety among systems of civil laws now it have to be admit that systems of civil law despite their variety be pretty much the same in their general outlinesbecause what they be mean to achieve and mainly do achieve be pretty much the same similarly all house have a roof and wall windows and chimneys though they be vary in their shape layout and materials but the common feature of house clearly point to the conveniences of human life and equally clearly so do the common feature of systems of civil law its really clear with both that the source of all this be reason and reflection on human need rather than a basic instinct i neednt mention the variations that all the rule of property receive from the finer turn and connections of the imagination and from the subtleties and abstractions of lawtopics and reason this cant possibly be reconcile with the notion of basic instincts snap judgments about injustice here be something that will create a doubt about the theory of justice that i have be defend our upbringing and acquire habit have the effect that when we blame something as an injustice we arent always conscious of any immediate reflection on its bad consequences when something be very familiar to us its familiarity make us apt to overlook it and what we have very frequently do for certain reason we be apt to go on do mechanically without recall every time the thoughts that first lead us to this the considerations of human convenienceor rather necessitythat lead to our have the notion of justice be so universal and everywhere point so much to the same rule of justice that the habit of condemn unjust act and institutions take place in all societies and we have to think about it a little to ascertain its true origin not that the origin be notably obscure even in ordinary everyday life we often resort to the principle of public utility say to ourselves or otherswhat would become of the world if that kind of behaviour be rampant how could society survive under such disorder from all this we seem to have learn something about the force that i have be highlightingthe force of thoughts about public interest and utilitynamely how strongly it affect our level of admiration or moral approval the sole basis for the virtue of justice be that justice be necessary for the support of society and since no moral excellence be more highly esteem than justice be we can conclude that this matter of usefulness have generally the strongest energy and most complete command over our sentiments so it must be the source of a considerable part of the merit ascribe to humanity benevolence friendship public spirit and other social virtues of that sort just as it be the sole source of our moral approval of fidelity justice veracity integrity and those other estimable and useful qualities and force in say this i be rely on the principle when any force have be find to have a great strength and energy in one instance credit it with have a similar energy in all similar instance this be entirely agreeable to the rule of philosophy here empirical science and even of common sense and it be indeed newtons chief rule of scientific method source of morals david hume political society political society if everyone be intelligent and wise enough to perceive at all time how strongly his interest be serve by the observance mean his observance of justice and equity and be strongminded enough to keep steadily focus on his overall longterm interest rather than be divert by the enticements of present pleasure and advantage there would never have be any such thing as government or political society in the situation as i have describe it each man would have live in entire peace and harmony with everyone elsedoing this in the exercise of his natural liberty with no constraints from governmental laws what need be there for manmade laws when unaided natural justice be a sufficient restraint if nothing ever go wrong why have judge why curtail our natural freedom when all our use of it be find to be innocent and beneficial obviously if there no way for government to be in the least useful it wouldnt exist the whole basis for the duty of allegiance to the government of ones country be the good that government do for society by preserve peace and order among mankind laws of nations when a number of political societies be form and they maintain a thick web of interactions amongst themselves it be immediately find that a new set of rule would be useful in that situation so such rule come into existence under the title laws of nations examples include ambassadors be not to be harm in any way poison weapons be not to be use a soldier in battle be not to be immediately kill if he surrender these rule and others of that kind be plainly calculate for the advantage of state and kingdoms in their interrelations the rule of justice that apply among individuals be not entirely suspend among political societies all rulers claim to respect the right of other rulers and no doubt some of them can say this without hypocrisy alliances and treaties be constantly be make between independent state and this would be a mere waste of parchment if it hadnt be find that treaties etc have some influence and authority but here be the difference between kingdoms and individuals human nature cant possibly survive without the association of individuals and that association can exist only if some respect be pay to the laws of equity and justice disorder confusion the war of all against all be the inevitable upshot of such licentious conduct as would occur if equity and justice have no place nations on the other hand can survive without have relations with one another they can even survive to some extent under a general war though respect for justice be useful among state it isnt as necessary or useful there as it be among individuals and correspond to that lessen usefulness be a lessen degree of moral obligation all politicians and most philosophers will allow that in particular emergencies reason of state may justify dispense with the rule of justice unilaterally invalidate some treaty or alliance the strict observance of which would be very harmful to either of the contract party but it be generally agree that nothing less than the most extreme necessity can justify individuals in a breach of promise or an invasion of the properties of others in a confederate commonwealth such as the ancient achaean republic in greece or todays swiss canton and unite provinces the netherlands the league have a source of morals david hume political society special utility and so the condition of union have a special sacredness and authority and a violation of them would be regard as be at least as criminal as any private injury or injustice chastity the long and helpless infancy of a human be require that the parent work together for the care of their young and this collaboration require the virtue of chastity ie fidelity to the marriage bed youll agree that if chastity werent useful in that way it would never have be think of as a virtue sexual infidelity in marriage be much more harmful in women than in men thats why the laws of chastity be much stricter over the female sex than over the male these rule be all connect with procreation yet they be suppose to apply to women who be past childbearing as much as to those in the flower of their youth and beauty general rule be often extend beyond their original source and this be true in all matter of taste and sentiment the star passage expand what hume write in ways that the small dot convention cant easily indicate it be agree that our ideas about personal beauty arise very much from ideas of utility an example might be this we see a humpback as ugly basically because we think of such a hump as an obstacle to activity to do well in lifethe opposite of useful now consider this story that have come out of france during a stockmarket surge in paris a humpbacked fellow go every day to the street where the stockbrokers gather and be well pay for let them use his hump as a desk on which to sign their contract so his hump be thoroughly useful but would the money that he make in this way turn him into a handsome fellow no the imagination be influence by associations of ideas and even if a give association initially arise from the judgmentsuch as the association of humpbacked with ugly mediate by the judgment that hump back be not usefulit isnt easily alter by particular exceptions that we come across that could explain our hostility to sexual infidelity in women who be past childbearing age there be also something else we can add if older women be free to be unchaste their example would be harmful to the younger ones if women could always look forward to a time when they would be at liberty to indulge themselves in this way it would be natural for them to bring that time closer ie not to wait and to think more lightly of this whole duty that be in fact so much need by society incest members of a single family live together have such frequent opportunities for licence of this kind hum exact phrase that nothing could preserve purity of manners if marriage or any sexual relationship be allow between people who be closely relate to one another incest therefore be especially harmful in its effect be regard as especially wicked and morally ugly and some of the detail of the antiincest morality can also be explain in term of consequences as i shall now show why do the laws of athens allow a man to marry a halfsister who have the same father as he do but not platos only answer to objections raise against the community of women that be establish in his imaginary commonwealth be this it be a good say and still be that what be useful be fair what be useless be ugly republic there cant be any doubt about this where public usefulness be concernedand that be platos topic indeed what other point be there to all the ideas of chastity and modesty phaedrus write unless what we do be useful the glory of it be nil plutarch write nothing that be harmful be beautiful the stoics think the same hume quote sextus empiricus as report this about the stoics he quote phaedrus in latin sextus in greek and plato and plutarch in both source of morals david hume political society a halfsister who have the same mother plainly for this reason the manners of the athenians be so reserve that a man be never allow to approach the womens part of any house even the house of a close relative except when he be pay a visit to his own mother his stepmother and her childrenincluding the halfsister be as much shut up from him as the women of any other family so that there be as little danger of any unlawful sexual relations between him and them as between him and any other women whereas a halfsister with whom he share a mother would be someone he have grow up with and see countless time for a similar reason uncles and nieces be allow to marry at athens but the permittedinathens marriages that i have mention be not permit in rome where relations between the sex be more open public utility be the cause of all these variations other kinds of immoral conduct if something that doesnt do a man credit escape his lips in private conversation or if he say it in a private letter it be highly blameworthy to repeat it to anyone else the free and social interactions of mind would be seriously inhibit if such rule of trustworthiness be not establish even in pass on gossip from which we cant foresee any harm result it be regard as a piece of indiscretion if not of immorality to tell whom we get the story from as these stories be pass from hand to hand they be alter in various ways and they often reach the persons concernedthe persons they be aboutand produce animosities and quarrel among people whose intentions be entirely innocent and inoffensive to pry into secrets to open or even read the letter of others to spy on their word and look and actionswhat practice be more troublemaking in society what habit therefore be more blameable this principle see note on title page of the wellbeing of society be also the basis for most of the laws of good mannersa kind of lesser morality that aim at the ease of company and conversation too much ceremony be blame so be too little and anything that promote ease without an indecent familiarity be useful and praiseworthy it be commendable to be constant in ones friendships attachments and familiarities and this be need to support trust and good relations in society but in place where people come together casually in some pursuit of health and pleasure public convenience doesnt require such constancy it be customary to encourage unreserved conversation in such contexts by grant the privilege of then drop ones casual acquaintance without this be a breach of civility or good manners the morality of lesser societies even in societies with utterly immoral foundations ones that be the most destructive to the interest of the general society there have to be certain rule that the members be constrain to observe by a sort of false honour as well as by private selfinterest robbers and pirate it have often be remark couldnt maintain their harmful confederacy if they didnt establish a new distributive justice among themselves call into force among themselves the laws of equity they have violate with the rest of mankind i hate a drink companion say the greek proverb who never forget the follies of the last drink spree should be bury in eternal oblivion so as to give full scope to the follies of the next one in any society or club that exist for the purpose of play some game there have to be laws govern how the game be play and these laws be different for different game the basis for such societies be admittedly frivolous and the laws be to a great extent though not entirely source of morals david hume why utility please capricious and arbitrary that create an important difference between these laws and the rule of justice fidelity and loyalty because the latter be require for there to be general societies of men which be absolutely requisite for the survival of the species so there be only a very limit liken between the rule of game and the moral rule of society at large all we can learn from it probably be that rule be necessary whenever men have any kind of relations with each other they cant even pass each other on the road without rule waggoners coachmen and mount couriers have principles govern who give way to whom and these be mainly base on mutual ease and convenience but some of them be arbitrary or at least dependent on a kind of capricious analogy like many of the reason of lawyers and it go even further than that men cant even murder each other without rule and maxims and an idea of justice and honour war have its laws as well as peace and even the kind of warforamusement that be carry on among wrestlers boxers and gladiators be regulate by fix principles the people concern have some interest in common and thus a share notion of what be useful and from this there inevitably arise a standard of right and wrong among them why utility please we praise the social virtues because of their utilitythats such a natural think that one would expect to meet with it everywhere in moral writers as the main basis for their reason and enquiry in ordinary everyday life the utility of conduct be always appeal to and we cant think of any greater eulogy to give to any man than to display his usefulness to the public and list the service he have do for mankind and society even our praise for the regularity and elegance of an inanimate form be conditional on those feature not destroy the things fitness for any useful purpose and what a satisfactory apology we can make for any disproportion or seem ugliness if we can show that the feature in question be need for the intend use a ship appear more beautiful to an artist or to anyone moderately skilled in navigation if its prow be wider one such rule be the lighter machine must yield to the heavier and in machine of the same kind the empty one must yield to the one that be load this rule be base on convenience then there be this rule those who be go to the capital city have precedence over those who be come from it this seem to be base on some idea of dignity of the great city and of the preference for the future over the past which if it be correct bring this rule under the head of arbitrary and capricious source of morals david hume why utility please than its stern than it would if it be build with precise geometrical regularity if a build doors and windows be exact square it would hurt the eye just because of that squareness which be illadapted to the shape of a human be for whose use the build be intend so its not surprise that a man whose habit and conduct be harmful to society and dangerous or harmful to everyone who have any connection with him should for that reason be an object of disapproval communicate to every spectator the strongest sentiment or feel of disgust and hatred and yet these effect of usefulness or its contrary have not loom large in philosophers systems of ethics and they have look elsewhere for explanations of the origin of moral good and evil why perhaps its because they find it hard to account for our attitude to usefulness but if we have have experience that confirm the existence of a principle see note on title page we shouldnt reject it just because we cant give a satisfactory account of its origin or show it to be a special case of some more general principle as for our present topic if we would just think about it for a little while we would find it easy enough to account for the influence that utility have on our feel and to deduce it from more general principles that be the best know the most thoroughly recognize in human nature moralitys basis be nature not indoctrination ancient and modern sceptics have infer from the apparent usefulness of the social virtues that all moral distinctions arise from cultural influence and that they be first invent and then encourage by the skill of politicians so as to make men manageable and to subdue the natural ferocity and selfishness which have make them unfit for society its true that this principle of instruction and upbringing have a powerful influence so that it can often make the sentiments of approval or dislike greater or smaller than they would have be if leave to nature and sometimes it can even create a new sentiment of approval or dislike one that owe nothing to any natural principlewhich be what happen in all superstitious practice and observances but surely no thoughtful enquirer would think that all moral affection or dislike arise from this origin if nature hadnt make any such distinction base on the original constitution of the mind language would not have contain the word honourable and shameful lovely and odious noble and despicable and if politicians have invent these term they could never have make them intelligible to anyone so this paradox of the sceptics be just very superficial it isnt hard to fend off the nitpick of that sect in the context of politics and morals it would be good if we deal with them as well in the context of the theoretical and less intelligible sciences of logic and metaphysics so we have to acknowledge that the social virtues have a natural beauty and amiableness which right from the outsetbefore any instruction or cultural inputattracts the respect and we oughtnt to think that because an inanimate object a chair say can be useful as well as a man it ought to qualify for the label virtuous as a man can the sentiments arouse by utility be very different in the two case in the case of the man the feel be mix with affection respect approval and so on but not in the case of the chair similarly the chair may have good colour and proportion just as a human figure can but can we ever be in love with the chair there be many passions and sentiments of which think rational be be the only proper object this be settle by the basic constitution of human nature and if qualities that would arouse love and affection in a human be be transfer to an inanimate object they wouldnt arouse the same sentiments a very small variation in the object even when the same qualities be preserve will destroy a sentiment thus the beauty for which a man love a woman if transfer to a man would not arouse an amorous passion except in case where nature be extremely pervert source of morals david hume why utility please affection of mankind and because the chief source of the merit of these virtues be their public utility it follow that the end that they tend to promote must be in some way agreeable to us take hold of some natural affection public utility must pleaseeither for selfinterested reason or from more generous motives the selfinterest theory of morality it have often be maintain that because every man have a strong connection with society and see that he cant possibly survive in isolation he favour all the habit or principles that promote order in society and give him the quiet possession of this priceless bless however much we value our own happiness and welfare we must to that extent applaud the practice of justice and humanity which be our only way of maintain the social confederacy and get for every man the advantage of mutual protection and assistance this derivation of morals from a concern for ones own interest be an obvious think and it hasnt arise wholly from the irresponsible tease attack of the sceptics to mention no others polybiusone of the gravest and most judicious writers of antiquity as well as one of the most moralhas trace all our sentiments of virtue to this selfish origin this be in book chapter of his histories but though the solid practical sense of that author and his dislike of vain subtleties give him considerable authority on the present subject this isnt something to be settle by authority and the voice of nature and experience seem plainly to oppose the selfish theory we often praise virtuous action that be perform long ago and far away where the utmost subtlety of imagination couldnt discover any appearance of selfinterest or find any way of connect our present happiness and security with events so widely separate from us when an adversary do something generous brave noble we approve his action even if we know that its consequences will go against our particular interest in any case where private advantage go along with our general affection for virtue we easily see and acknowledge the mixture of these distinct sentiments which feel different and have different influence on the mind we be perhaps quicker to praise generous humane action that further our own interest but those interest come nowhere near to explain the topics of praise that we insist on probably mean the general principles that govern our most intensely felt praise and we can try to bring other people over to our sentiments without try to convince them that they get any advantage from the action that we be present for their approval and applause if you describe the model of a praiseworthy character consist of all the most lovable moral virtues and give examples in which these virtues display themselves in an extraordinary manner you will easily elicit esteem and approval from all your audience without their even ask when and where this noble person live yet when and where be absolutely crucial to selflove ie the concern for ones own individual happiness heres an example of what undutifulness to parent be disapprove of by every person who reflect on what he see and compare the future with the past express his indignation at this illtreatment to which he foresee that he also may some day be expose ingratitude be disapprove of for a similar reason though polybius seem here to mix in something more generous each person be bind to be shock by ingratitude through sympathy with the resentment of his neighbour and from the think that he may at some time suffer in the same way and from that arise in the mind of every man a certain sense of the nature and force of duty perhaps he mean only that our sympathy or humanity be more enliven by our consider the similarity of our case with that of the person suffer which be a good point source of morals david hume why utility please i mean there be a statesman who in the shock and contest of partypolitical conflict manage through his eloquence to get an able adversary banish he secretly follow the adversary offer him money for his support during his exile and consolation in his misfortunes alas cry the banish statesman how i regret leave my friends in this city where even enemies be so generous we give this conduct the praise and approval that it deserve and we dont retract these sentiments when we learn that all this happen in athens about two thousand years ago and that the men involve be eschines and demosthenes when press by these facts and arguments a defender of the selfinterest theory of morality might say we transport ourselves by the force of imagination into distant time and place and think about the advantage that we would have reap from these character if we have be contemporaries and have be involve in the situation this be a dodge and a weak one at that it be not conceivable how a real sentiment or passion could arise in us from what we know to be an imaginary interest especially when our real interest be still keep in view and be often acknowledge to be entirely distinct from the imaginary one and sometimes even opposite to it a man who be bring to the brink of a precipice cant look down without tremble and the sentiment of imaginary danger drive him in opposition to his belief that he be really safe this may look like a real example of something i have say to be inconceivable but it isnt really because it have a special feature in this case the imagination be help by the presence of a strike objectthe cliffface and the sheer drop and also because it be really a different phenomenon even the strike object wont have this effect unless it be for this man somewhat unusual and unfamiliar custom soon reconcile us to heights and precipices and wear off these false and delusive terrors in our estimate of character and conduct the reverse be the case the oftener we engage in careful scrutiny of morals the more delicate be the feel we acquire of the most minute differences between vice and virtue indeed in everyday life we so often express all kinds of moral determinations that nothing of this kind could be new or unusual to us and no false view or prejudice could hold their grind against experience that be so common and familiar what mainly form associations of ideas be experience so that no association could possibly be establish and survive in direct opposition to experience usefulness be agreeable and elicit our approval this be a matter of fact confirm by daily observation but useful for what for somebodys interest surely whose interest then not only our own for our approval frequently extend beyond our own interest so it must be the interest of those who benefit from the character or action we approve of from which we can conclude that the welfare of those people however far away they be in time or space be not a matter of total indifference to us by open up this principle see note on title page we shall discover one great source of moral distinctions selflove be such a busily energetic drive in human nature and the interest of each individual be usually so closely connect with that of the community that there be an excuse for the philosophers who think that all our concern source of morals david hume why utility please for the public might ultimately come down to a concern for our own happiness and preservation heres how they arrive at that think they saw every moment instance of approval or blame satisfaction or displeasure towards character and action they call the object of these sentiments virtues or vices they saw that virtues tend to increase the happiness of mankind and that vices tend to increase mankinds misery they ask themselves could it be that we have any general concern for society or any disinterested not self interest resentment of the harm that come to others and they find it simpler to regard all these sentiments as special case of selflove and discover an excuse at least for this unify move in the fact that the interest of any individual be so often closely link to the interest of the public despite this frequent mix of interest however it be easy to perform what natural scientistsfollowing bacon call a crucial experiment one that point out the right way in any doubt or ambiguity we have find case where someones private interest be different fromeven contrary tothe public interest and where nevertheless the moral sentiment stay steady despite this divergence of interest and whenever these distinct interest be see to coincide we always find a noticeable increase in the sentiment a warmer affection for virtue a more intense detestation of vice feel that be properly call gratitude and revenge under pressure from these examples we have to reject the theory that account for every moral sentiment in term of selflove we must make room for a more publicaffection and allow that we have some concern for the interest of society consider just in itself usefulness be only a tendency to lead to a certain result and it be a contradiction in term to say i be please with x as a mean to y though y itself be something i be not concern with thus if usefulness be a source of moral sentiment and if this usefulness be not always think of in term of useful to me it follow that anything that contribute to the happiness of society recommend itself directly to our approval and goodwill here be a drive within us that account in great part for the origin of morality why should we look for abstruse and remote systems when such an obvious and natural one lie ready to hand sympathy see note on page be it hard for us to understand the force of humanity and benevolence or to take in that the very look of happiness joy and prosperity give pleasure the very look of pain suffer and sorrow communicate uneasiness the latin poet horace say that the human countenance borrow smile or tear from the human countenancehuman face laugh with those who laugh and weep with those who weep if you reduce a person to solitude he will lose almost all enjoyment because his emotions arent help along by correspond emotions in his fellowcreatures i say almost all because he might still have intellectual pleasures eg from solve a mathematical problem and sensual we neednt push our research so far as to ask why do we have humanity ie a fellowfeeling with others its enough that we experience this as a force in human nature our examination of cause must stop somewhere and in every science there be some general principles drive that we cant hope to show to be special case of something even more general no man be absolutely indifferent to the happiness and misery of others the first have a natural tendency to give pleasure the second pain you can find this in yourselfso can anyone its not likely that these principles can be resolve into simpler and more universal ones whatever attempt may have be make to do that and even if it be possible that wouldnt be part of my present topic for present purpose we can safely treat these principles as basic and be well satisfy if we can make all their consequences sufficiently plain and clear that be we can ignore any question about what lead to them and focus on what come from them source of morals david hume why utility please pleasures eg feel warm and well feed even when the sign of sorrow and mourn be arbitrary conventional or at any rate not natural they still make us sad and the natural symptoms tear and cry and groan never fail to create compassion and uneasiness in other people mind and if the effect of misery affect us in such a lively manner can we be suppose to be entirely unfeeling or indifferent towards its cause when a malicious or treacherous character and conduct be present to us suppose we enter a convenient warm welldesigned apartment we have to get pleasure just from see it because it present us with the please ideas of ease satisfaction and enjoyment the hospitable goodhumoured humane landlord appear and this event must surely make the whole even more attractive and we cant easily forbear reflect with pleasure on the satisfaction that everyone get from their deal with him his whole family show their happiness by the freedom ease confidence and calm enjoyment express in their face i have a please sympathy in the prospect of so much joy and cant think of the source of it without have the most agreeable emotions he tell me that an oppressive and powerful neighbour try to dispossess him of his inheritance and for years disturb all his innocent and social pleasures i feel an immediate indignation arise in me against such violence and injury he add that it isnt surprise that a private wrong should come from a man who have enslave provinces depopulate cities and make the battlefield and the scaffold stream with human blood i be strike with horror at the prospect of so much misery and be drive by the strongest hostility towards its author wherever we go whatever we think or talk about just about everything present us with a view of human happiness or misery and arouse in us a sympathetic surge of pleasure or uneasiness in our serious occupations and in our careless amusements this principle still exert its active energy sympathy and the ar ts a man who enter a theatre be immediately impress by the view of so many people share in one common pastime and he experience just from the look of them a heighten of his disposition to have every sentiment or feel that his fellowcreatures have he notice that the actors be energise by the appearance of a full house and raise to a level of enthusiasm that they cant command when they be calm and alone if the play be skillfully write every emotion represent on the stage be communicate to the spectators as though by magic the spectators weep tremble resent rejoice and be inflame with all the variety of passions that drive the character in the drama when an event in the play go against our wish and interrupt the happiness of our favourite character we be conscious of feel anxiety and concern if their suffer come from the treachery cruelty or tyranny of an enemy we experience intense resentment against the enemy it be regard as contrary to the rule of art to represent a calamity in a cool and indifferent manner a distant friend or a confidant who have nothing immediately at stake in the catastrophe ought if possible to be avoid by the playwright because such a character might communicate a similar indifference to the audience few species of poetry be more entertain than the pastoral and we be all aware that the chief source of its source of morals david hume why utility please pleasure arise from the image of a gentle and tender tranquillity that it represent in its character communicate a similar sentiment to the reader the italian poet sannazaro in his piscatory eclogues shift the scene from gentle pleasant meadows to the seashore this let him present the ocean the most magnificent object in nature but it be agree that it be a wrong choice the idea of the toil labour and danger suffer by the fishermen be painful to the reader because of the unavoidable sympathy that accompany every conception of human happiness or misery no passion when well represent can be entirely indifferent to us because every man have within him at least the seed and first principles see note on title page of every passion its poetrys business to bring every affection near to us by lively imagery and representation make it look like truth and reality which be a certain proof that wherever reality itself be find our mind be dispose to be strongly affect by it any recent event that affect the fate of state provinces or many individuals be extremely interest even to those whose welfare be not directly involve news of such an event be quickly spread eagerly hear and enquire into with attention and concern on such an occasion the interest of society appear to be to some extent the interest of each individual the imagination be sure to be affect though the passions that be arouse may not always be strong and steady enough to have much influence on behaviour read a history book seem like a calm entertainment but it wouldnt entertain at all if the reader didnt have feel correspond to those that the historian describe its hard to read thucydides or guicciardin attentively while one describe trivial clash between small cities of greece and the other describe the harmless war between pisa and florence not many people be involve and the interest be small so these passages dont fill our imagination or bring our feel into play but the deep distress of the large athenian army that attack syracuse and the danger that constitute such a strong threat to venicethese arouse compassion these move terror and anxiety we can become convince of the cruel depravity of the roman emperors nero and tiberius by the cool uninvolving style of suetonius as well as by the masterly write of tacitus but what a difference in our feel suetonius coldly relate the facts whereas tacitus set before our eye the venerable figure of soranus and thraseatwo of neros innocent victimswho face their fate bravely and be move only by the melt sorrow of their friends and families what sympathy then touch every human heart what indignation against the tyrant whose ungrounded fear or unprovoked malice give rise to such detestable barbarity if we shift from play and historybooks and look at reallife events that we observe for ourselves powerful concern be arouse and how much stronger it often be than the narrow attachments of selflove and selfinterest popular uprise party zeal devote obedience to leaders of groupsthese be some of the most visible effect though not the most commendable of this social sympathy in human nature our feel be somewhat engage by anything that carry an image of human sentiment and affection even when the subject be fairly trivial when a person stutter we sympathize with this trivial uneasiness and suffer for him and it be a rule in criticism that every combination of syllables or letter that be hard to pronounce sound harsh and disagreeable to the ear apparently because of a sort of sympathy indeed when we skim a book with our eye we notice such unharmonious composition because we still imagine that someone be read it aloud to us and have a hard time pronounce these source of morals david hume why utility please jar sound so delicate be our sympathy beauty utility sympathy relax and unconstrained posture and motion be always beautiful an air of health and vigour be agreeable clothe that warm us without burden the bodythat cover us without imprison the limbsare welldesigned the feel of the affect person have a role in all our judgments of beauty communicate to the spectator similar touch of pain or pleasure so its not surprise that we cant make judgments about the character and conduct of men without consider the likely consequences of their action and the happiness or misery they bring to society what association of ideas could operate if the sympathy principle be totally inactive sympathy and morality if a man isnt affect by image of human happiness or miserybecause he be emotionally cold or narrowly selfish he must be equally indifferent to the image of virtue and vice and on the other hand we always find that a warm concern for the interest of our species be accompany by a delicate feel for all moral distinctionsa strong resentment of harm do to men a lively approval of their fare well people can be see to differ a great deal in this respect but noone be so entirely indifferent to the interest of his fellowcreatures that he doesnt have any sense of action as be morally good or bad because of the result they tend to produce if someone be confront by two candidates for his moral judgment one that be beneficial and another that be harmful to his species or community its not possible that he wont prefer the beneficial one however coolly and ascribe to it some measure of merit however small it be not possible if he wear a human heart hum exact phrase let us suppose someone who be ever so selfish with his own private interest occupy ever so much of his attention even this man in case where his own interest be not affect must inevitably feel some lean towards the good of mankind as the goal to choose other things be equal we surely take into consideration the happiness and misery of others when we be weigh the various motives for action and incline to the happiness side when no private concern draw us to seek our own advantage by harm our fellowcreatures and if the principles of humanity be capable in many instance of influence our action they must always have some authority over our sentiments see note on page and give us a general approval the horse whose flank be slim be handsomerand faster the athlete whose muscle have be well develop by exercise be better to look atand more likely to win outward appearance be never separate from usefulness everyone with any sense know this quintilian institute book ch how much good we expect to flow from someones conduct depend in part on how high his social rank be and on the quality of the relationshipsin private life in business in politics etcinto which he have enter if he fall short of our expectations we blame him for not be more useful and we blame him much more severely if anything positively bad have arise from his behaviour when theres a clash of interest between two countries we judge the merit of a statesman by how much good or bad have result for his own country from his action and advice without regard to their adverse effect on its enemies and rival his fellowcitizens be central to our thoughts when we be determine his moral character nature have implant in everyone a greater affection for his own country than for any other so we never expect any regard to distant nations when a competition arise another quite different reason for attend primarily to what the statesman achieve for his own country depend not on its be his own but on its be just one country be aware that the interest of mankind in general be better promote when every man attend to the good of his own community than they would be if everyone act on the basis of a loose indeterminate view about the good of the species the latter motivation doesnt provide one with a suitably limit object on which to exert oneself so no good can be expect to come from it source of morals david hume why utility please of what be useful to society and disapproval of what be dangerous or harmful the strength of these sentiments in this or that kind of case may be the subject of controversy but there cant be a viable theory or system that deny their existence a creature who be absolutely malicious and spiteful if there be such a thing in nature must be worse than merely indifferent to the image of vice and virtue all his sentiments must be invert and be directly opposite to the sentiments that prevail in the human species anything that contribute to the good of mankind will run contrary to the constant direction of his wish and desire and must therefore produce uneasiness and disapproval in him and on the other hand anything that be a source of disorder and misery in society must for the same reason be regard by him with pleasure and satisfaction timon of athens be call the manhater probably more because of his depression than because of inveterate malice one day he embrace alcibiades with great fondness say go on my boy acquire the confidence of the people then one day i foresee that youll be the cause of great calamities to them this story be from plutarch if the manicheans be right in their view that the universe be a battlefield between two principles or gods one good one and the other evil these two gods would have to have totally opposite sentiments concern human action as well as concern everything else every case of justice and humanity that please one of the gods because of its tendency to do good would displease the other all mankind so far resemble the good principle that our natural philanthropy incline us always to give the happiness of society preference over its misery and consequently to prefer virtue to its oppositeexcept at time when selfinterest or revenge or envy have pervert our disposition it may be that absolute unprovoked disinterested malice never find a place in any human breast but if it do it must there pervert all the sentiments of morals as well as the feel of humanity if neros cruelty have be entirely voluntary rather than be an effect of constant fear and resentment its obvious that his steady and uniform approval would have go to the cruel treacherous selfserving tigellinus rather than to his two noble advisors seneca and burrhus a statesman or patriot who serve our own country in our own time will always have a more passionate respect pay to him than one whose beneficial influence operate long ago or in distant countries thats because the good result from the generous humanity of the latter person be less closely connect with us be less brightly light for us and affect us with a less lively sympathy we may agree that their merit be equally great although our sentiments be not raise to the same height by both in a case like this our judgment correct the inequalities of our internal emotions and perceptions just as it preserve us from be mislead by the various image present to our external sense when the distance from us of an object be double it then throw on the eye a picture half the size of the previous one but we imagine that it look the same size in both situations because we know that its image would expand if we walk towards it and that this expansion would come not from the object itself but from our position in relation to it indeed without such a correction of appearancesboth in internal and external sentimentwe could never think or talk steadily about anything while our fluctuate situations continually for a similar reason our moral determinations or general judgments be base on the tendencies or expectable consequences of action and character not on the actual consequences that they happen to have though in our real feel or sentiment we cant help take a more favourable view of source of morals david hume why utility please vary the things we be talk about throw them into such different and contrary light and position the more we converse with other people and the larger the set of social interrelations that we maintain the more familiar well become with these general preferences and distinctions without which we could hardly speak intelligibly to each other every man selfinterest be special to himself and the aversions and desire arise from it cant be suppose to mean as much to anyone else so general language which be form for general use have to be mould on some more general view its way of use word expressive of praise or blame have to be make to fit sentiments arise from the general interest of the community grant that in most men these sentiments arent as strong as the ones concern private good still everyones feelingseven those of the most deprave and selfish peoplemust make some distinction between what be generally beneficial and what isnt attach the notion of good to generally beneficent conduct and the notion of evil to the contrary let admit that sympathy be much fainter than our concern for ourselves and that sympathy with persons far away be much fainter than sympathy with persons nearby but for precisely this reason we must in our calm think and speak about the character of men neglect all those differencessetting aside selfother nearfar and thennowand make our sentiments more public and social and its not just that we ourselves often change our situation in one of these respect in addition to that be constantly meet up with people whose situation be different from ours people we could never talk with if we remain constantly in the position and point of view that be special to ourselves so the interplay of sentiments in society and conversation make us form some general unchanging standard by which we may approve or disapprove of character and conduct the heart doesnt entirely adopt those general notions or regulate all its love and hatred by the universal abstract moral differences of vice and virtue without regard to whether something affect oneself or ones near and dear still these abstract moral differences have a lot of influence and serve well enough for discourse at least someone whose position join to his virtue make him really useful to society than of someone who exercise the social virtues only in good intentions and benevolent affections because his social position doesnt enable him to do any actual good for society it isnt hardand it be necessaryfor us to separate each persons character from how things happen to work out for him and have make this separation we judge these two persons to be morally on a par and give them the same general praise our judgment correct the appearance or try to but it cant entirely prevail over sentiment why be this peachtree say to be better than that one if not because it produce more or better fruit and wouldnt we give the same praise to it even if snail or vermin have destroy the peach before they be ripe in morals too isnt the tree know by the fruit and cant we easily distinguish nature from accident with the man as well as with the tree nature have wisely ordain that private connections should commonly prevail over universal view and considerations otherwise our affections and action would be dissipate and lose for lack of a proper limit object thus a small benefit do to ourselves or our near friends arouse more lively sentiments of love and approval than a great benefit do to a distant commonwealth but still we know to correct these inequalities by source of morals david hume why utility please which mean that they serve all our purpose in company in the pulpit on the stage and in the school thus in whatever light we take this subject the merit ascribe to the social virtues still appear to be uniform and arise chiefly from the concern that the natural sentiment of benevolence get us to have for the interest of mankind and society if we consider these drive that be build into the human makeup as we encounter them in daily experience and observation we must a priori conclude that a creature such as man cant be totally indifferent to the wellbeing or illbeing of his fellowcreatures and must be dispose to pronounce straight offin a case where nothing give him any particular biasthat what promote their happiness be good and what tend to their misery be bad say this without any qualifications or ifs or buts strictly an a priori belief owe nothing to experience whereas this one hume say rest on daily experience and observation but when on this page he speak of look at the matter a posteriori the standard opposite of a priori it seem that the distinction he be make be between view about morality that be base on the prior facts about human nature from view about morality that be base on facts about the consequences of morality the facts that be posterior to it here then be the faint rudiments or outline at least of a general distinction between action and to the extent that any individual persons humanity intensify his connection with those who be injure or benefit and the liveliness of his conception of their misery or happiness his consequent censure or approval will become correspondingly more vigorous a generous action barely mention in an old history book or a minor magazine neednt communicate any strong feel of applause and admiration when virtue be place at such a distance its like a star to the eye of reason it appear as luminous as the sun at noon ie as a matter of theory we think it be that bright but its so far away that it doesnt affect the sense with either light or heat bring this virtue nearer by our acquaintance or connection with the people involve or even just by an eloquent description of the case and then our hearts be immediately catch our sympathy enliven and our cool approval convert into the warmest sentiments of friendship and respect these seem to be necessary and certain consequences of the general principles of drive in human nature as reveal in common life and practice now let us run all this in the opposite direction consider the matter a posteriori think about consequences doesnt the merit of social virtue come in large measure from the feel of humanity that such virtue produce in the spectators it seem to be a plain matter of fact that the utility of somethingof anythingis a source of praise and approval that utility be constantly appeal to in all moral decisions about the merit or demerit of action the only source of the high respect pay to justice fidelity honour allegiance chastity inseparable from all the other social virtues humanity generosity charity friendliness mildness affability gentleness mercy and moderation and in short a foundation for the chief part of morals the part concern mankind as a whole it appear also that in our general approval of character and conduct the useful tendency of the social virtues doesnt move us through selfinterest but have a much more universal and extensive influence it appear that a tendency to public good and to the promote of peace harmony and think about them and retain a general standard of vice and virtue base chiefly on general usefulness these corrections be like the ones we perform in process what come to us through our sense order in society always engage us on the side of the social virtues by work on the benevolent force in the human makeup and it appear as an additional confirmation that these drive of humanity and sympathy enter so deeply into all our sentiments and have such a powerful influence that they can arouse the strongest censure and applause my present theory be the simple result of all these inferences each of which seem to be base on uniform experience and observation if you arent sure whether theres anything in our nature give us humanity or a concern for others think about this we see in countless case that anything tend to promote the interest of society be very highly approve of by people in general that should teach you that we have a drive to benevolence and that it be strong because nothing could possibly please us as a mean to an end if we didnt care in the least about the end on the other hand if you arent sure whether there be implant in our nature anything make us engage in moral blame and approval think about this we see in countless case the influence of humaneness from that you should infer that everything that promote the interest of society must communicate pleasure and what be harmful must give uneasiness but when these different line of think come together in establish the same conclusion dont they put that conclusion beyond the reach of any doubt or denial but i hope to provide further confirmation for this theory when i present other sentiments of admiration and respect that come from the same source or from ones like it qualities useful to ourselves it seem clear that when we examine a quality or habit that someone have if it show up as be in any respect bad for the person in question or if it incapacitate him for business and action we immediately blame it and count it among his fault and imperfections laziness negligence lack of order and method obstinacy fickleness rashness credulitynoone ever regard any of these qualities as neutral feature of someones character let alone praise them as accomplishments or virtues their downside immediately strike our eye and give us the sentiment of pain and disapproval its generally agree that no quality be absolutely either blameable or praiseworthy ie theres no quality that be blameable whenever it occur and none that be praiseworthy whenever it occur the moral status of a give instance of a quality depend on the degree to which the quality be present in it the aristotelians say that what make something virtuous be its be appropriately between two extremes but that isnt seriously in conflict with my view because this between position be chiefly determine by usefulness take the example of speed in business if someone isnt fast enough hell make no progress in any project if he go too fast hell act precipitately and wont coordinate his do properly with those of other people thats the sort of reason we use in decide what be the proper and commendable middle in all moral and prudential contexts and we never lose sight of the advantage that result from any character or habit these advantage be enjoy by the person who have the character or habit we be judge so whatever it be that make the view of them agreeable to us the spectators and prompt our admiration and approval it cant be selflove the star passage expand what hume write in ways that the small dot convention cant easily indicate it add nothing to the content someone might think that its our selflove that be at work cooperate with our imagination thus our imagination turn us into the other person make us imagine that we be him and be get for ourselves the benefit of the valuable qualities that really belong to him then imagination immediately whip us back into ourselves and make us love and esteem the person while see him as different from us but this cant be right our imagination lack the strength to perform the first operation and the speed to perform the second view and sentiments that be so opposite to know truth and to each other could never be hold at the same time by the same person so we can rule out the suspicion that what look like expressions of benevolence be really selfish what drive our feel be something quite different something that give us a concern for the wellbeing of the person we be think about when his natural talents and acquire abilities give us the prospect of his rise higher advance in his career acquire renown have prosperous success steadily master the mishaps that fate send his way and carry out great or advantageous undertake we be impress by these agreeable image and feel arise in us a satisfaction and respect towards him the ideas of happiness joy triumph and prosperity be connect with every detail of his character and spread through our mind a please sentiment of sympathy and humanity try this supposition a person whose fundamental nature be such that he have no kind of concern for his fellowcreatures and regard the choice between happiness and misery for all sentient be with utter indifferenceeven more so than the choice between two colour for a curtain when he can hardly tell them apart if he be ask to choose between the prosperity of nations and their ruin he would stand like the famous philosophical assequidistant from two indistinguishable bale of hayirresolute and undetermined between equal motives or rather like the we can go so far as to say that there be no human creature to whom the appearance of happiness doesnt give pleasure and the appearance of misery doesnt give uneasiness set aside case where envy or revenge enter the picture this seem inseparable from our makeup and constitution but its only the more generous mind that be prompt by this to try hard to procure the good of others and to have a real passion for their welfare with men of narrow and ungenerous spirit the sympathy i have be speak of be nothing more than a slight feel of the imagination which serve only to arouse sentiments of satisfaction or censure and to affect what kinds of adjectives they will apply to the person a clutch miser for instance praise industry and frugality extremely highly even in others and rank them above all the other virtues he know the good that result from them and feel that sort of happinessthe good will come of this sort of happinesswith a livelier sympathy than he would get from think about any other virtue yet it may be that he wouldnt part with a shill to make the fortune of the industrious man whom he praise so highly same ass between two piece of wood or of marble with no inclination or lean to either side i think it must be grant that the person i have suppose be absolutely unconcerned for the public good of a community or the private utility of others would look on every quality however harmful or beneficial to society or to the person who have it with the same indifference as he would look on the most common and uninteresting object but if instead of this imagine monster we suppose a man to form a judgment or make a decision in the caseie the choice between the prosperity of nations and their ruin there be for him a plain basis for preference other things be equal and even if his choice be cool his heart selfish and the people concern remote from him there must still be for him a choice or distinction between what be useful and what be harmful now this usefulharmful distinction be the same in all its part as the moral distinction whose basis have be so often and so fruitlessly search for the sentiment of morals and the sentiment of humanity be favour by the same endowments of the mind down to the finest detail a temperament that be give to intense feel of either of these kinds will also be give to intense feel of the other kind and when the object come closer or be more closely connect that enliven each sentiment to the same degree by all the rule of science therefore we must conclude that these sentiments be basically the same since in every tiny detail they be govern by the same laws and move by the same object why do scientists infer with the greatest certainty that the moon be keep in its orbit by the same force of gravity that make body fall near the surface of the earth because when these effect be calculate they be find to be similar and equal shouldnt this argument be as convince in moral theories as in natural ones this occurrence of moral mean have to do with human behaviour hum question be not shouldnt this be as convince in ethics as it be in empirical science and be more like shouldnt this be as convince in psychology as it be in physics theres no need for me to produce lengthy detail evidence that any quality that be useful to its possessor be approve of and that any thats harmful to its possessor be censure the least reflection on what we experience in everyday life will be sufficient ill just provide a few instance in order to remove all doubt and hesitationif i can discretion the quality that be most need for carry out any useful enterprise be discretionbeing careful in our interrelations with others attend properly to our own character and to theirs weigh each detail of the project we be undertake and employ the surest and safest mean for achieve any end or purpose to people like oliver cromwell and the french churchman and politician and schemer cardinal de retz discretion may appear to be an aldermanlike virtue a virtue suitable for a conscientious town councillor as jonathan swift call it it might really be a fault or imperfection in them be incompatible with the vast project to which their courage and ambition prompt them but in ordinary everyday life no virtue be more need not just to succeed but to avoid spectacular failure for someone who lack discretion his have many other virtues and strengths may be fatal to him if it werent too perfect for human nature i would say that the best character be that which be not sway by moods of any kind but alternately employ enterprise and caution depend on which be useful for the particular purpose intend that be the kind of excellence that an historian attribute to marshal turenne in his service to louis xiv the boldness of his military enterprises increase campaign by campaign until he reach the age and stage at which know all about war from long experience he could advance with greater firmness and security along the wellknown road machiavelli remark about two military leaders in ancient rome that fabius be cautious and scipio enterprising each succeed because when he have command the state of affairs in rome be right for his talents but both would have fail if the situations have be reverse it be good to be in a situation that suit ones frame of mind but a more excellent person be the one who can suit his frame of mind to any situation industriousness what need be there to praise hard work and to extol its advantage in the acquisition of power and riches the tortoise accord to the fable by sheer perseverance win the race against the much faster hare when a man time be well husband it be like a cultivate field a few acres of it produce more useful stuff than do extensive provinces that have the richest soil but be overrun with weed and brambles husband mean manage with a suggestion of the management of a farm frugality and prodigality a prodigal be someone who spend extravagantly the standard label for jesuss parable of the prodigal son refer not to the sons leave home and then return but to his waste his substance in riotous live but theres not much chance of succeed in life or even of survive in tolerable condition unless one be reasonably frugal for someone who be not frugal the heap of his money instead of increase decrease day by day this leave him intensely unhappy because if he couldnt keep his expense within the confine of a large income he certainly wont able to live contentedly on a small one plato write that the souls of men who be inflame with impure appetites when they lose the body that be their only source of satisfaction hover about the earth haunt the place where their body be burn and hanker to recover their lose organs of sensation phaedo ce it be like that with worthless prodigals who have spend their fortune in wild debauch they still have the organs of sensation because they arent dead yet but they have lose the financial mean to gratify their appetites and so they gatecrash wellprovided dinners and party of pleasure hat even by the dissolute and despise even by fool at one extreme of frugalityor more accurately of the scale that have frugality near the midpointis miserliness this be rightly censure for two reason it deprive a man of all use of his riches and it get in the way of hospitality and every social enjoyment at the other end of the scale be prodigality which be commonly more hurtful to the man himself which of these extremes be regard as worse than the other depend on the temperament of the person who be do the judge vir tues with complex moral source qualities often get their merit from complicate source honesty fidelity and truthfulness be praise because of their immediate tendency to promote the interest of society but once they have be establish on this foundation these virtues be also regard as advantageous to the person who have them and as the source of the trust and confidence that a man must have if he be to get any respect in life someone who lack these three virtues be find to be contemptible because he forget the duty he owe to himself and odious because he forget the duty he owe to society this consideration may be one chief source of the intense blame attach to unchastity in a woman the greatest respect that women can get come from their fidelity and a woman who fail in this become cheap and vulgar lose her rank and be expose to every insult the smallest failure in this respect be enough to blast her character she have so many opportunities for secretly indulge her sexual appetites that the only way we can be sure of her be for her to have absolute modesty and reserve and once the wall have be breach it can hardly ever be fully repair if a man behave with cowardice on one occasion brave conduct on a later occasion will restore his reputation but if a woman once behave in a dissolute fashion what can she then do to make us sure that she have form better resolutions and have enough selfcontrol to act on them its agree that men be equal in their desire but few succeed in achieve it one large cause of this be the lack of the strength of mind need to enable a man to resist the temptation of present ease or pleasure and carry him forward in the search of profit and enjoyment further on in the future when we look in a general way on the object of our like and dislike we decide on certain rule of conduct and certain measure of preference for one kind of object over another these decisions result from our calm passions and inclinationsfor what else could declare any object to be desirable or undesirable and yet they be often say in a natural misuse of word to be decisions reach by pure reason and reflection but when some of these object come nearer to us in time or in space or acquire the advantage of be see in a more flatter light or from a more favourable angle which catch the heart or imagination our general resolutions be frequently defeat a small enjoyment be prefer and last shame and sorrow be bring down on us and however much wit and eloquence poets expend in celebrate present pleasure and reject all longdistance view of fame health or fortune it be obvious that this practice of favour the present at the expense of the future be the source of all dissoluteness and disorder all repentance and misery a man with a strong and determine mind stick to his general resolutions and isnt seduce by the allurements of pleasure or terrify by threats of pain but keep his eye steadily on the distant pursuits by which he ensure both his happiness and his honour a certain degree of selfsatisfaction be an advantage equally for the fool and for the wise man but there be no other charactertrait and no other aspect of life where the fool and the wise man be on an equal foot business book conversationa fool be totally unfit for all of these and remain a useless burden on the earth except for the possibly useful coarse drudgery that he be condemn to by his position in life thats why we find that men be extremely protective of this aspect of their character there be many examples of men openly and fully declare their own profligacy and treachery but there be no examples of men placidly accept that they be regard as ignorant and stupid let alone examples of men loudly declare their ignorance and stupidity no affectionate connection be strong enough to survive the disgust arise from this character ie from the belief that some person that one have deal with be stupid and ignorant actually there be one exception to what i have just say it be the affection of parent for their offspring which be the strongest and most indissoluble bond in nature love itself which can survive treachery ingratitude malice and infidelity be immediately extinguish by stupidity when it be perceive and acknowledge the passion of love be not diminish by ugliness and old age more than it be by stupidity that be a measure of how dreadful we find the ideas of an utter incapacity for any project or undertake and of continue error and misconduct in life think about the question that can be ask about which of two kinds of understand be more excellent quickness or slowness on the uptake the ability to penetrate far into a subject straight off with no ability to do anything through study or the opposite character which have to work everything out through hard concentrate work a clear head or a richly inventive one profundity of think or sureness of judgment obviously we cant answer any of these question without consider which qualities equip a man best for the world and carry him furthest in anything he undertake if refine sense and exalt sense arent as useful as common sense their rarity and novelty and the nobleness of their object compensate somewhat for this and make them the admiration of mankind in the same way gold be less serviceable than iron but be much more valuable than iron because of its scarcity memory the defect of judgment cant be make up for by any skills or inventions but defect of memory can often be make up for in business and in scholarship by be methodical and hardworking and by thoroughness in write everything down we hardly ever hear a short memory give as a reason for a man failure in any undertake but in ancient time when no man could rise to prominence without a talent for speak and when the audience be too delicate to put up with such crude undigested harangue as todays impromptu orators offer to public assemblies the faculty of memory be of the utmost consequence and be accordingly much more value than it be these days almost every great genius who be mention in antiquity be celebrate for this talent and cicero include it in his list of the sublime qualities of caesar himself he have talent intelligence memory write skill attentiveness reflective judgment diligence particular customs and manners make a difference to how useful a personal quality be they also make a difference to its merit particular situations and events have to some extent the same influence someone who have the talents and accomplishments that suit his social position and his profession will always be more admire than someone to whom the luck of the draw have assign a social place that be wrong for him the private or selfish virtues be in this respect more arbitrary than the public and social ones in other respect they may be less liable to doubt and controversy in recent years in great britain men in active life have spout so much about their public spirit and theoreticians and scholars have go on so much about benevolence that men of the world be apt without any bad intention to reveal a sullen incredulity about those moral endowments and even sometimes to deny that they exist at all they have be encourage in this attitude by the fact that many false claim to public spirit or benevolence have be detect this seem to me to resemble something that happen in the ancient world the perpetual cant of the stoics and cynics concern virtue their splendid claim to virtue and its small part in their live make people disgust with virtue as well as with them and lucian a very moral writer except for be licentious with regard to pleasure couldnt write about the muchboastedof virtue without betray symptoms of bad temper and irony hume have a footnote here quote in greek some of lucians turn of phrase but surely this peevish faultfinding wherever it come from can never be take so far as to make us deny the existence of every species of merit and all distinctions of manners and behaviour there be charactertraits whose very name force one to agree that they have meritdiscretion caution enterprise industry assiduity frugality economy good sense prudence discernment and besides these there be many others to which the most determine scepticism cant for a moment refuse the tribute of praise and approval temperance sobriety patience constancy perseverance forethought considerateness the ability to keep secrets orderliness persuasiveness in speech presence of mind quickness of conception ease of expressionthese and a thousand more of the same kind wont ever be deny by anyone to be excellencies and perfections their merit consist in their tendency to serve the person who have them with no grand claim to public and social merit and that make us less grudge in admit their claim and we readily put them on the list of praiseworthy qualities although we arent aware of this at the time by grant the merit of those characteristics we have pave the way for all the other moral excellences so that we cant consistently hesitate any longer about the existence and moral status of disinterested benevolence patriotism and humanity we have before us now the selfregarding virtues that i list earlier and the social virtues of justice and beneficence you might at first glance think it would be easier to represent theoretically as disguise selflove than to represent in that way but the truth turn out to be the exact opposite to make a case for s be disguise selflove we need only say that whatever conduct promote the good of the community be love praise and admire by the community because of the good it bring to the community and thus to every member of it in fact whats be talk about here be not selflove but gratitude and the distinction between these be pretty obvious still a superficial reasoner might overlook it so those who be sceptical about justice and benevolence have some grind to stand on at least for a moment in contrast with that qualities that tend only to the advantage of the person who have them without any reference to us or to the community be nevertheless admire and value by us and the community what theory or system be there that will account for this sentiment in term of selflove derive it from that favourite origin it seem that we have to admit that the happiness and misery of others be not matter of entire indifference to us and that the view of happiness whether in its cause or its effect give us a secret joy and satisfaction comparable with to take a humdrum example the satisfaction of see sunshine on a well cultivate field while the appearance of misery affect us in the kind of way in which a dark raincloud or a barren landscape throw a melancholy damp over our imagination and once this concession have be make the difficulty be over we can hope that from here on a natural unforced interpretation of the phenomena of human life will prevail among all those who work on moral theory i have be discuss the way our sentiments of respect and esteem for a person arise from his qualities of mind it would be a good idea now to examine how these sentiments of ours be influence by a persons bodily endowments and by whatever advantage he haseg inherit wealththrough the luck of the draw our aim will be to see whether these phenomena strengthen or weaken my theory it will naturally be expectedand it be suppose by all the ancient moraliststhat physical beauty will be similar in some respect to beauty of the mind and that every kind of esteem we have for a man will have something similar in its origin whether it arise from his mental endowments or from his exterior circumstances one considerable source of beauty in any animal obviously be the advantage it get from the particular structure of its bodythe advantage in the particular way of life that nature have destine the animal for the best proportion of a horse as describe by xenophon and virgil be the same ones that be accept today by our modern horsedealers because they have the same foundation namely experience of what be detrimental or useful in the animal broad shoulder a lank belly firm joint taper legs all these be beautiful in our species because they be sign of force and vigour ideas of usefulness and its opposite though they dont entirely settle what be handsome or ugly be clearly the source of a considerable part of our approval or dislike in ancient time bodily strength and dexterity be much more esteem and value than they be today because back then they be much more useful and important in war than they be today we obviously find this in homer and the poets but even the ancient historians mention bodily strength among the accomplishments of the heroes they write about even the theban general epaminondas whom the historians acknowledge to be the greatest hero statesman and general of all the greeks be praise for his physical strength he give another example pompey as describe by sallust then this be like what i say about memory physical strength like memory be more importantly useful in ancient time than it be now sexual impotence bring down on a person derision and contempt from women as well as men thats because of how very unuseful impotence be the unfortunate sufferer from it be see as be deprive of an important kind of pleasure and at the same time disable from give such pleasure to others if a woman be barren that be hold against her because barrenness be a kind of inutility a way of not be useful but our reaction to barrenness be not as intense as our reaction to impotence and my theory make very obvious the reason for this namely that the disadvantage come from barrenness be less extensive that those that come from impotence there be no rule in paint or sculpture more indispensable than that of balance the figure and place them with the greatest exactness on their proper centre of gravity a figure that isnt balance properly be ugly because it give to grasp the idea of perfect merit that prevail in those time look at what diodorus siculus write about epaminondas in other illustrious men youll observe that each possess some one shin quality that be the foundation of his fame but in epaminondas all the virtues be find unitedbodily strength eloquence of expression vigour of mind lack of interest in riches gentleness of disposition andthe main thingcourage and conduct in war all men be equally liable to pain and disease and sickness and may again recover health and ease because these circumstances dont distinguish one man from another they arent a source of pride or humility respect or contempt but compare our own species to superior onessuch as the angels that theologians tell us aboutis a very humble practice remind us that we be all so liable to diseases and infirmities while the angels arent and theologians accordingly go on about this in an attempt to lower our selfsatisfaction and vanity hum next sentence they would have more success if the common bend of our thoughts be not perpetually turn to compare ourselves with others he may have mean they would have more success in this if we werent already familiar with that contrast because we have often compare ourselves with others include angels us the disagreeable ideas of fall harm and pain a disposition or cast of mind that qualify a man to rise in the world and advance his fortune be entitle to esteem and respect as i have already explain so it can naturally be suppose that the actual possession of riches and authority will have a considerable influence over these sentiments if we look for an hypothesis through which we can explain people respect for the rich and powerful the only satisfactory one well find be the theory that this respect come from the spectators enjoyment of the image he get of prosperity happiness ease plenty authority and the gratification of every appetite there be other theories of course but they dont do the job for example some philosophers make so much of selflove that they consider it to be the source of every sentiment but it be clearly inadequate for this purpose in the absence of any goodwill or friendship it be hard to see what could be our basis for hop for advantage from the riches of others yet we naturally respect the rich even before they reveal any such favourable disposition towards us we have these same sentiments even when we be so far out of the persons sphere of activity that we cant even think that he could do us any good in all civilize nations a prisoner of war be treat with a respect appropriate to his social level and obviously a man riches go a long way towards settle what his social status be if birth and rank come into this also that provide yet another an argument for my thesis when we call someone a man of birth what do we mean but that he be descend from a long succession of rich and powerful ancestors so that we esteem him because of his connection with people we esteem thus his ancestors be respect partly because of their riches although we cant expect anything from them because they be dead i dont have to go so far as prisoners of war or the dead to find examples of this disinterested not self interest respect for riches look carefully at things that happen all the time in ordinary life and conversation let suppose that a man who be reasonably well off be introduce to a company of strangers he naturally treat them with different degrees of respect depend on what he be tell about their different fortunes and condition yet he cant possibly think he will get any monetary advantage from any of them and perhaps wouldnt accept it even if he could when a traveller be admit into company he always meet with a degree of civility that be proportional to what his attendants and his gear indicate about how rich he be in short the different social rank of men be to a large extent regulate by riches and that hold for superiors as well as inferiors for strangers as well as people we know why do we want riches for ourselves because they be a mean of gratify our present or possible future appetites why do someones be rich create esteem for him in others what i have be say seem to force us to the conclusion that the same answer hold its because riches be a mean of gratify appetites this indeed be their very nature or essence they be directly connect with the commodities conveniences and pleasures of life when that connection be brokenas with an iou from a bankrupt banker or gold on a desert islandriches arent riches any or he may have mean theyd have more success in this if we pay attention to their contrast between ourselves and angels rather than busily compare ourselves with other people the infirmities of old age be upset because we can compare ourselves with the young more when we approach a man who be as we say at his ease or today perhaps in comfortable circumstances we be present with the please ideas of abundance satisfaction cleanliness warmth a cheerful house elegant furniture good servants and whatever be desirable in food drink and clothe when a poor man appear on the other hand our imagination be immediately strike by disagreeable image of want poverty drudgery dirty furniture coarse or rag clothe disgust food and nasty drink what else do we mean by say that one be rich the other poor and as respect in one case and contempt in the other be the natural consequence of those different situations in life it be easy to see that these facts throw light on and help to confirm the theory i have present regard all moral distinctions consider a man who have cure himself of all ridiculous assumptions and be fully sincerely and steadily convincedfrom experience as well as from philosophythat the difference of fortune make less difference in happiness than most people think this man wont measure out degrees of esteem accord to the incomes of the people he know he may outwardly defer to the great lord more than to the peasant because riches be the most convenient because the most fix and determinate source of distinction but his inner sentiments be govern by mens personal character rather than by the accidental and whimsical favour of fortune in most countries of europe the chief source of distinction be family ie hereditary wealth mark with title and symbols from the king in england more respect be pay to present opulence and plenty each practice have its advantage and disadvantage the disadvantage of respect birth be that inactive spiritless mind remain in haughty idleness and dream of nothing but pedigrees and genealogies the advantage be that those who have energies and ambition put them to work in the search for honour and authority reputation and favour the disadvantage of focus respect on riches be that this encourage corruption bribery plunder the advantage be that it encourage arts manufacture commerce and agriculture the family prejudice be more favourable to military virtue so that its more suit to monarchies the riches prejudice be the chief spur to hard work so that it agree better with a republican government theres something extraordinary and seemingly inexplicable in the way our emotions behave when we consider the fortune and circumstances of others very often someone elses advancement and prosperity produce envy which have a strong mixture of hatred and arise chiefly from compare ourselves with the other person yet at the very same time or at least rapidly alternate with the envy we may feel the passion of respect which be a kind of affection or goodwill with a mixture of humility on the other hand the misfortunes of our fellows often cause pity which have in it a strong mixture of goodwill this sentiment of pity be closely relate to contempt which be a kind of dislike with pride mix in i point out these facts just as interest to think about for those who be study the human condition for my present purpose all i need be the fact that power and riches commonly cause respect and poverty and meanness cause contempt though in particular contexts the emotions of envy and of pity may enter the picture qualities immediately agreeable to ourselves cheerfulness have you ever spend an even with sad serious people and see what happen when a goodhumoured and lively person join the group how quickly the conversation come to life and cheerfulness diffuse itself over everyones face talk and behaviour if so youll have no trouble agree that cheerfulness carry great merit with it and naturally draw in the goodwill of mankind indeed no other quality more readily communicate itself to all around because no other have a greater propensity to display itself in cheerful talk and pleasant entertainment the flame spread through the whole circle and the most sullen and gloomy be often ignite by it i have trouble agree with the latin poet horace that the melancholy hate the merry because it have always be my experience than when the jollity be moderate and decent serious people be all the more delight because it dissipate the gloom that usually oppress them and give them an unusual enjoyment the power of cheerfulness to communicate itself and to draw approval show us that there be another set of mental qualities which without be useful or tend to produce further good for the community or for the person who have the quality give satisfaction to the beholders and procure friendship and respect have one of these qualities feel good other people enter into the same mood and catch the sentiment by a contagion or natural sympathy and as we cant help love whatever give us pleasure a kindly emotion arise towards the person who give so much satisfaction as between a cheerful person and a melancholy deject sullen anxious person the former be more enliven to be with his presence give us more serene contentment and enjoyment and we find it more agreeable to enter into his feel and disposition that explain our affection and approval for the cheerful person and our aversion and disgust towards the gloomy one few men would envy the character that caesar attribute to cassius in shakespeares famous play he love no play as thou dost anthony he hear no music seldom he smile and smile in such a sort as if he mock himself and scorn his spirit that could be move to smile at any thing just before this caesar have say that such men be dangerous and so they commonly be but also they can never become agreeable to others or contribute to social entertainment because they have so little enjoyment within themselves in all civilize nations a like for pleasure if accompany by temperance and decency have always be regard as a considerable merit even in the greatest men and in those of inferior rank and character it be need even more the french writer saintévremond give an attractive picture of this aspect of his frame of mind i love virtue without austerity pleasure without effeminacy life without fear its end everyone be from time to time affect with all the disagreeable passionsfear anger dejection grief melancholy anxiety and so on but to the extent that these be natural and universal they make no difference between one man and another and can never be the object of blame its only when a persons temperament give him a general tendency to have one or more of these disagreeable passions that they disfigure his character create a sentiment of disapproval in the spectator by make him uneasy sublimity in this next paragraph disdain of slavery mean proud refusal to knuckle under to anyone your disdain of slavery be your attitude to your be subject to someone else you may not dislike the idea of my be subject to someone else also both here and further on slavery cover all sort of knucklingunder include ones that arent as extreme as slavery in our literal sense of the word who be not strike with any notable instance of greatness of mind or dignity of character with elevation of sentiment disdain of slavery and the noble pride and spirit that arise from conscious virtue longinus write that sublimity be often nothing but the echo or image of magnanimity ie greatness of mind and when someone manifest this quality even if he doesnt utter a word he arouse our applause and admiration an example of this be the famous silence of ajax in the odyssey a silence that express a nobler disdain and more resolute indignation than any language can convey go cry alexander to his soldier who have refuse to follow him to india go and tell your countrymen that you leave alexander complete the conquest of the world the prince of condé who always admire this passage comment alexander abandon by his soldier among barbarians not yet fully subdue felt in himself such a dignity and right of empire that he couldnt believe it possible that anyone would refuse to obey him it make no difference to him whether he be in europe or in asia among greeks or among persians wherever he find men he expect to find subject in corneilles tragedy médée a friend advise medea to be cautious and submissive list the distress of that unfortunate heroine and ask her what do you have to support yourself against your many implacable enemies she reply myself myself i say and that be enough boileau rightly recommend this passage as an instance of true sublimity when phocion the modest gentle phocion be be lead to execution he turn to one of his fellowsufferers who be lament his own hard fate and say isnt it glory enough for you that you die with phocion this be from plutarchs live phocion contrast that with the picture tacitus draw of vitellius no longer emperor prolong his period of shame because of his wretched love of life hand over to the merciless rabble toss punch and kick around force by a dagger hold under his chin to raise his head and expose himself to everyones abuse what abject infamy what low humiliation yet even here say tacitus he show some symptoms of a mind not wholly degenerate to a tribune who insult him he say i be still your emperor this paragraph use mean in a sense that be current in hum time but not today a beggar ask whiningly can you spare a dime and i say no my answer may show that i be mean in our sense the beggar question show that he be mean in hum sense in our ordinary everyday deal with one another we never excuse a total lack of spirit and dignity of character ie of a proper sense of what be due to ones self this vice constitute what we properly call meanness when a man submit to the basest slavery see note above in order to gain his end fawn on those who mistreat him or degrade himself by intimacies and familiarities with tacitus histories he start this narration thus as he be lead away with his clothe all tattered a dreadful spectacle many curse him and noone weep the ugliness of his exit have drive out compassion to get a proper sense of this way of think he have to make allowance for the ancient maxim everyone have a right to dispose of his life and after anyones life become dishonorable he have not only a right but a duty to part with it undeserving inferiors the first two of these be somewhat connect with one another but not with the third which be an entirely different way of shamefully let oneself down a certain degree of nobleminded pride or selfvalue be so much need for a worthwhile life that when someones mind lack it we find that upset in the same way as we be upset by someones lack a nose or an eye courage the usefulness of courage both to the public and to the person who have it be an obvious foundation of merit but if you think about it youll see that this quality have a special shine on it that come not from its consequences but wholly from itself and from the noble elevation that always accompany it the figure of courage as depict by painters and poets display in each feature a sublimity and dare confidence that catch the eye draw the affections and through sympathy spread a similar sublimity of feel over every spectator in a speech by the athenian orator and politician demosthenes defend his administration and justify the obstinate love of liberty with which he have inspire the athenians he represent philip of macedon in these glow colour i behold philip the very philip with whom you have be fight pursue empire and dominion while expose himself to every woundhis eye gore his neck twist his arm and thigh piercedwhatever part of his body fortune should seize on he cheerfully give it up provide that he could live in honour and renown with what remain shall it be say that he bear in pella a place that use to be mean and ignoble be inspire with such high ambition and thirst for fame while you who be athenians and on he go these praise arouse the most lively admiration and we can see that the view the orator present doesnt bring in anything about the future advantageous consequences of philips valour it doesnt go beyond the hero himself hume now give three examples of people who value courage more highly than civilise people would in modern time the ancient romans call courage virtue thereby rat it higher than any other moral qualities the suevi as report by tacitus go in for elaborate hairstyling not for romantic purpose but to frighten their enemies the scythians as report by herodotus admire most the warriors who have the largest decorative cloths make from their enemies scalp he continue that show how greatly among the scythians as well as many other nations bravery in war destroy the sentiments of humanity which be surely a much more useful and attractive virtue we can see indeed that in all the uncultivated nations that havent yet have a full experience of the advantage that come with beneficence justice and the social virtues courage be regard as the predominant excellence the one that be most celebrate by poets recommend by parent and instructors and admire by people in general the ethics of homer be in this respect very different from those the absence of a virtue can often be a vice and sometimes one of the worst sort meanness be one example of that ingratitude be another where we expect a beauty the disappointment give us an uneasy sensation and produce a real ugliness and abjectness of characterie meannessis disgust and contemptible in another way also where a man have no sense of value in himself we arent likely to rate him any higher and if someone who crouch to his superiors be insolent to his inferiors as often happen the second kind of behaviour doesnt cancel out the first it add to it make the man still more odious through the addition of a further vice see of fénelon his elegant modern imitator they be well suit to an age in whichas report by thucydidesone hero could ask another be you a robber without give offence not so long ago similar ethics prevail also in many barbarous part of ireland if we can believe the poet edmund spensers judicious account of the state of affairs in that kingdom tranquillity belong to the same class of virtues as courage be the undisturbed philosophical tranquillity that enable one to rise above pain sorrow anxiety and each assault of bad luck conscious of his own virtue say the philosophers the tranquil sage elevate himself above every chance happen and from his secure place in the temple of wisdom he look down on inferior mortals engage in pursuit of honour riches reputation and every frivolous enjoyment no doubt a fullstrength version of this attitude be far too magnificent for human nature but the attitude carry with it a grandeur that seize the spectator and arouse his admiration and the nearer we can come in practice to this sublime tranquillity and evenmindedness not to be confuse with the insensibility produce by stupor the more secure enjoyment we shall attain within ourselves and the more greatness of mind we shall reveal to the world this philosophical tranquillity may indeed be consider as just one form of magnanimity greatness of mind look at socrateshis perpetual serenity and contentment amidst the greatest poverty and domestic trouble his resolute contempt see note on page for riches and his magnanimous care for preserve liberty while refuse all help from his friends and disciples so as to avoid even the very mild dependence that consist of be oblige to someone who doesnt admire him among the ancients the philosophical heroes as well as the military and patriotic ones have a grandeur and force of sentiment that astonish our narrow mindswe quickly reject it as extravagant and supernatural but then suppose the ancients have an accurate representation of usand especially of the degree of humanity clemency order tranquillity and other social virtues that we have achieve in the administration of government in modern time they would have have good reason to regard our way of do things as romantic and incredible that be how natureor rather culturehas handle the uneven distribution of excellences and virtues in those different age benevolence i have already explain the merit that benevolence have because of its usefulness its tendency to promote the good of mankind and thats certainly the source of a considerable part of everyones esteem for to it but that be not the only thing that make benevolence attractive to us the softness and tenderness of this sentiment its engage endearments its fond expressions its delicate attentions and all the flow of mutual confidence and concern that enter into a warm attachment of love and friendshipthese feel be delightful in themselves so they be bind to communicate themselves to the spectators and melt them into the same fondness and delicacy a tear naturally start in our eye when we see a warm sentiment of this kind our breast heave our heart be agitate and every humane tender activator in our makeup be set in motion and give us the he write it be a common custom among their gentlemens sons that as soon as they be able to use their weapons they immediately round up three or four stragglers or footsoldiers and wander idly around the country with them steal only food until eventually the young gentleman run up against real resistance and have to cope with it and once this be know he be regard as a man of worth in whom there be courage purest and most satisfactory enjoyment when poets describe the elysian field whose bless inhabitants have no need of each others assistance they still represent them as maintain constant exchange of love and friendship and soothe our mind with the please image of these soft and gentle passions who would want to live amidst perpetual wrangle scold and mutual reproach the roughness and harshness of those emotions disturb and displease us we suffer by contagion and sympathy see note on page and we cant remain indifferent spectators even if we be certain that the angry passions we be observe wont have any harmful consequences here be proof positive that benevolence doesnt get all its merit from its usefulness we sometimes gently blame someone for be too good we say this if he exceed his part in society and take his care for others beyond the proper bound similarly we say that someone be too highspirited too dare too unconcerned about fortunethese be reproach that really basically imply more admiration than many speeches of praise do be accustom to score the merit and demerit of character chiefly by their useful or harmful tendencies we cant help apply the language of blame when we encounter a sentiment that be so intense as to be harmful but it can happen at the same time that the sentiments noble elevation or its lovable tenderness so grip the heart that it increase our friendship and concern for the person some other examples the amours and attachments of henry iv of france during the civil war between protestants and catholics frequently hurt his interest and the cause he be fight for but many peoplethe young the amorous and perhaps others who can sympathize with the tender passionswill agree that this be a weakness in him while also admit that its what chiefly endear that hero to them and interest them in his fortunes the excessive bravery and resolute inflexibility of charles xii ruin his own country and make trouble for all his neighbour but those personal characteristics of his have such splendour and greatness in their appearance that they strike us with admiration we might even to some extent approve of them if it werent for the fact that they sometimes reveal clear symptoms of madness the athenians claim to have invent agriculture and laws and they always value themselves extremely because of the benefit these two inventions bring to the whole race of mankind they also boast and with reason of their warlike enterprises particularly against the innumerable fleet and armies of persians that invade greece during the reign of darius and xerxes as for the usefulness of these two achievements one peaceful and the other military theres simply no comparison and yet we find that the orators who have write so elaborately in praise of that famous city have chiefly triumph in display its warlike achievements lysias thucydides plato and isocrates all reveal that same preference or bias this attitude to military glory though it be condemn by calm reason and reflection seem to be very natural in the mind of man we can see that the great charm of poetry consist in lively picture that it draw of the sublime passions magnanimity courage disdain of fortune or of the tender affections love and friendship which warm the heart and spread through someone may be blame for an excess of cheerfulness but this could hardly happen if it werent for the fact that dissolute mirth without no proper cause or subject be a sure mark of folly which make it disgust it similar sentiments and emotions in fact we find that all kinds of passion even disagreeable kinds like grief and anger convey satisfaction when arouse by poetry but the more elevate or softer affections have a special influence and bring pleasure from more than one cause or source not to mention that they alone interest us in the fortune of the persons represent or create in us any esteem and affection for their character hume say that involve a mechanism of nature that it isnt easy to explain his own attempt to explain it be his essay tragedy and can it possibly be doubt that the poets ability to move the passions be a very considerable merit and that enhance by its extreme rarity it can exalt the person who have it above every character of the age in which he live the prudence skill steadiness and benign government of the roman emperor augustus adorn with all the splendour of his noble birth and imperial crown be not enough to bring his fame up to the level of virgils though the fame of virgil be support by nothing but the divine beauties of his poetical genius i have present examples of the various species of merit that be value for the immediate pleasure they give to the person who have them this sentiment of approval isnt in any way base on usefulness or future beneficial consequences yet it be similar in kind to the other sentiment the one that do arise from thoughts about public or private usefulness what the two have in common be that they both arise from social sympathy or fellowfeeling with human happiness or misery and the way this keep turn up in all the part of my theory can fairly be regard as a confirmation of it qualities immediately agreeable to others it be the natureindeed the definitionof virtue that it be a quality of the mind agreeable to or approve of by everyone who consider or contemplate it but some qualities produce pleasure because they be useful to society or useful or agreeable to the person himself others produce it more immediately and it be to these others that i now turn companionable vir tues here be two parallel developments in society at large the mutual shock and oppositions of interest and selflove have constrain mankind to establish the laws of justice so as to preserve the advantage of mutual assistance and protection in smaller private gather the contrarieties of mens pride and selfconceit have introduce the rule of good manners so as to help the exchange of ideas and keep conversation go among wellbred people mutual deference be affect contempt of others be disguise authority be conceal attention be give to each in his turn and an easy conversation be maintain without speak heatedly or interruption or eagerness for victory and without any air of superiority such conduct be immediately agreeable to others independently of any thoughts of utility or beneficial tendencies they draw affection promote esteem and enhance the merit of the behaver many of the form of breed be arbitrary and casual but what they express be always the same a spaniard go out of his own house before his guest to signify that he leave the guest in charge in other countries the owner of the house walk out last as a common mark of deference and respect but a man wont be perfectly good company unless he have wit and ingenuity as well as good manners it may be hard to define wit but its surely easy enough to learn that wit be a quality immediately agreeable to others and that on its first appearance it communicate a lively joy and satisfaction to everyone who have any comprehension of it in hum day wit cover more than it do for us today for something to qualify as an example of wit in his sense it need to be clever imaginative in some way precise it doesnt have to be funny the most profound metaphysics might be employ in explain the various kinds of wit and many of its species that we now class as wit on the sole testimony of taste and sentiment simply because thats what they feel like might turn out to be special case of something more general but all i need for present purpose be that wit do affect taste and sentiment and that because it give immediate enjoyment it be a sure source of approval and affection in countries where men pass most of their time in conversation and visit and assemblies these companionable qualities be highly value and constitute a large part of personal merit in countries where men live a more domestic life and either be employ in business or pass the time in a narrower circle of acquaintance respect be pay mainly to more solid personal qualities i have often observe that the first question the french ask regard a stranger be be he wellmannered do he have wit in our own country the chief praise bestow be always that someone be a goodnatured sensible fellow in conversation the lively toandfro spirit of dialogue be agreeable even to those who dont want to take part which be why the teller of long stories and the pompous conversational lecturer be very little approve of but most men do want to take part in the conversation and take a very dim view of the loquacity that deprive them of a right that they be naturally so protective of on social occasion we often encounter liars who tell stories about marvel their usual intention be to please and entertain and really they be harmless but men be most delight with what they think be true so these liars be utterly mistake about the mean of please and incur universal blame we be less hostile to lie or fiction when it occur in humorous stories because in that context it really be agreeable and entertain and truth be not important endowments that seem immediately agreeable and have a merit distinct from their usefulness include eloquence intellectual excellence of all kinds and even good sense and sound reason when they occur in a high degree and be employ on subject that be worthy and suitably challenge and these noble talents of the human mind get additional value from their rarity because rarity greatly increase the price of everything value oneself modesty can be understand in different sense even if we set aside chastity which i have already discuss hume identify and set aside four things that he say can be call modestyperhaps they could then but not now then but its most usual mean be in contrast to impudence and arrogance and express diffidence about ones own judgment and due attention and respect for others especially in young men this quality be a sure sign of good sense and its also a certain mean for a young man to increase his endowments by keep him always want to improve himself and keep his ears open to instruction on how to do it and this kind of modesty have a further charm to every spectator it flatter the spectators vanity by present the appearance of a teachable pupil who listen attentively and respectfully to every word he utter men have in general a much greater tendency to overvalue than to undervalue themselves notwithstanding aristotles opinion this make us more hostile to someones overvalue himself and cause us to regard with a special indulgence any tendency towards modesty and diffidence about ones abilities because we dont think that anyones undervalue himself risk go to such an extreme that it constitute a vice analogously in countries where people tend towards obesity personal beauty be associate with a much greater degree of slenderness than it be in countries where the most usual defect be thinness be so often strike with examples of one kind of ugliness people think they can never keep at too great a distance from it and want always to lean to the opposite side similarly if the door be open to self praise and we follow montaignes maxim that one should not shrink from say i have sense i have learn i have courage or beauty or wit if one think it be true we all know that such a flood of insolence would break in on us that it would make society wholly intolerable that be why custom have establish it as a rule in public gather that men should not indulge themselves in selfpraise or indeed say anything much about themselves and it be only among intimate friends or very mature people that a man be allow to do himself justice nobody find fault with the prince of orange for his reply to someone who ask him who do you think be the first general of the age to which he reply the marquis of spinola be the second notice that the princes imply selfpraise be better imply than if he have directly and openly express it only a very superficial thinker would imagine that all instance of mutual deference be to be understand as be mean seriously and literally and that there be something admirable about be ignorant of ones own merit and accomplishments we look with favour on a small bias towards modesty even in the internal sentiment especially in young people and on a strong bias in the outward behaviour but this doesnt exclude a noble pride and spirit that may openly display itself in its full extent when one be be attack or oppress in any way the noble obstinacy of socrates as cicero call it have be highly celebrate down through the centuries and when join to the usual modesty of his behaviour it form a shin character iphicrates the athenian be accuse of betray the interest of his country ask his accuser would you have be guilty of that crime in those circumstances by no mean reply the other well then cry the hero can you imagine that iphicrates would be guilty in short a noble spiritedness and selfvalue be a great excellence when it be well found be decently disguise be courageously support under distress and calumny and seem to derive its merit from the noble elevation of its sentiment or its immediate agreeableness to its possessor in a footnote hume cite aristotles nichomachean ethics he be presumably think of the description in a of unduly humble men their fault be worse than that of unduly proud men aristotle say and be commoner in people with ordinary character we approve of a bias towards modesty which be a quality immediately agreeable to others so we have two virtues a noble sense of ones own value and modesty when be excessive the resultant viceinsolence or haughtinessis immediately disagreeable to others when be excessive the resultant vice be immediately disagreeable to the person himself thats how we settle the boundaries of these duties a desire for fame reputation or stand in society be so far from be blameable that it seem inseparable from virtue intellectual power and creativeness and a noble disposition society expect and demand that we attend even to trivial matter in order to please others so its no surprise to find a man in company dress more elegantly and converse more pleasantly than when he be at home with his own family well then what be vanity which be rightly regard as a fault or imperfection a man vanity seem to consist chiefly in immoderately display his advantage honour and accomplishments and openly and pushily demand praise and admiration to such an extent that he offend others and encroach too far on their vanity and ambition which they have keep secret its also a sure symptom of the lack of the true dignity and highmindedness that be such a great ornament in any character why that impatient desire for applause as if you werent rightly entitle to it and couldnt reasonably expect that you would always get it why so anxious to tell us about the great people you have be associate with the compliment that have be pay to you the honour and distinctions you have receive as if these be not matter of course that we could easily have imagine without your tell us about them clean and decent decency or act appropriately to ones age sex character and station in the world be one of the qualities that be immediately agreeable to others and therefore be praise and approve effeminate behaviour in a man a rough manner in a womanthese be ugly because they be unsuitable to each character and different from the qualities we expect in the sex its as if a tragedy be full of fine comic bits or a comedy be full of tragic scenes the disproportions hurt the eye and convey to the spectators a disagreeable sentiment that be the source of blame and disapproval cleanliness deserve a place among the virtues because our cleanliness naturally make us agreeable to others and be a considerable source of love and affection noone will deny that someones neglect to keep himself clean be a fault and what make this a fault ie a minor vicemust be the uneasy sensation it give to others so this seemingly trivial matter clearly reveal the origin of moral distinctions about which the learn have involve themselves in such mazes of perplexity and error i know not what in addition to all the agreeable qualities the origin of whose beauty we can to some extent explain and account for there be something elsesomething mysterious and inexplicable which convey an immediate satisfaction to the spectator although he have no idea of why there be a manner a grace an ease a genteelness an iknownotwhat that some men possess more of than others its very different from external beauty and comeliness yet it catch our affection almost as suddenly and powerfully as beauty do and though this manner be chiefly talk about in connection with sexual passion where the conceal magic be easily explain surely much of it carry weight in all our value of character and form a considerable part of personal merit so this class of accomplishments must be trust entirely to the blind but sure testimony of taste and sentiment ie must be handle entirely through our feel with no guidance from any theoretical considerations and it must be consider as a part of ethics leave by nature to baffle all the pride of philosophy and make her aware of how narrow her scope be and how meagre her possessions we approve of someone because of his wit politeness modesty decency or any agreeable quality that he possess even if we have never meet him and so have never derive any benefit from these accomplishments of his we do have an idea of the effect they must have on those who be acquaint with him that have an agreeable influence on our imagination and give us the sentiment of approval all our judgments concern people manners and character have this idea as one of their source conclusion you could reasonably find it surprise that at this late stage in history anyone should think it necessary to argue elaborately for the thesis that personal merit consist entirely in the possession of mental qualities that be useful or agreeable to the person himself or to other people you might have think that this principle must have occur even to the first rough and ready enquirers into morals and have be accept as selfevident without any argument or disputation whatever be valuable in any way so naturally class itself as either useful or agreeablein latin as utile or dulcethat its hard to think why we should ever seek further or consider the question as a matter of intricate research or inquiry and if a quality that someone have be useful or agreeable it must be useful or agreeable to or for someoneeither the person himself or other people out of this a complete delineation or description of merit seem to emerge as naturally as a shadow be cast by the sun or an image be reflect on water if the grind on which the shadow be cast be smooth and level if the watersurface from which the image be reflect be calm an accurate figure be immediately present naturally nobody have to work at it why have such a simple and obvious theory so long have escape the most elaborate examination it seem reasonable to suppose that its because systems and hypotheses have pervert our natural understand like wind ruffle the surface of the water and spoil the reflection anyway whatever have happen in philosophy in ordinary everyday life these principles be still implicitly maintain whenever we applaud or censure any human behaviour we never allude to anything elseie anything except facts about what be usefulagreeable to himothers if we observe men in every interaction of business or pleasure in every discourse and conversation we wont find them have any difficulty about this subject of the basis for praise and blameexcept in the philosophy departments think about how natural the follow conversation be first speaker you be very fortunate that you have give your daughter to cleanthes hes a man of honour and humanity everyone who have any deal with him be sure of fair and kind treatment qualities useful to others second speaker i congratulate you also on the promise expectations of this soninlaw his hard work study the laws and his quick mind and knowledge impressive in one so young both of men and of business promise that he be due for great honour and advancement qualities useful to the person himself third speaker you surprise me when you speak of how hard cleanthes work at his business when i meet him recently in a very cheerful group he be the very life and soul of our conversation i have never before encounter anyone with so much wit along with good manners so much gallantry without affectation so much nontrivial knowledge so genteelly deliver qualities immediately agreeable to others fourth speaker you would admire him still more if you know him better the cheerfulness that you might notice in him isnt something he switch on when he be in company it run through the whole tenor of his life and keep a perpetual serenity on his face and tranquillity in his soul he have meet with severe trials misfortunes and even dangers and his greatness of mind enable him to rise above them qualities immediately agreeable to the person himself then i join in the picture of cleanthes that you have just present be a picture of accomplish merit a philosopher might select this character as a model of perfect virtue in common life every quality that be useful or agreeable to ourselves or to others be regard as a part of personal merit and nothing else will be so regard as long as men be judge things by their natural unprejudiced reason without the delusive gloss of superstition and false religion celibacy fast penance mortification physically hurt oneself selfdenial humility silence solitude and the whole train of monkish virtueswhy be they everywhere reject by men of sense its because they serve no purpose of any kind they dont advance a man fortune in the world or make him a more valuable member of society they dont qualify him for the entertainment of others or make him better able to enjoy himself what we see be just the opposite they interfere with all those desirable end they stupefy the understand and harden the heart obscure the imagination and sour the temper so we be right to transfer them to the opposite column put them in the list of vices and no superstition have enough force among men of the world to pervert entirely these natural sentiments relate to what be usefulagreeable to oneselfothers a gloomy harebrained fanatic may after his death have a place in the calendar of saint but while he be alive hell scarcely ever be admit into intimacy and society except by those who be as delirious and dismal as he be it seem like a good feature of my theory that it doesnt get into the vulgar dispute about the degrees of benevolence or selflove that prevail in human nature ie the dispute that sprawl across the territory between those who hold that human be be very benevolent and not very selfish and those who hold that they be very selfish and not very benevolent that dispute isnt likely ever to be settle for two reason because men who have take part in it be not easily convince and because the phenomena that can be produce on either side be so scatter so uncertain and open to so many interpretations that its scarcely possible to command a clear view of them as a totality or draw from them any determinate inference or conclusion all i need for my present purpose be agreementand surely it would be the greatest absurdity not to agreethat there be in our makeup some benevolence however little some spark of friendship for human kind some particle of the dive work into our constitution along with the elements of the wolf and the serpent however weak these generous sentiments or feel be even if they dont have enough force to move a hand or a finger they must still direct the decisions of our mind and produceother things be equala cool preference for what be useful and serviceable to mankind as against what be harmful and dangerous this immediately give rise to a moral distinction a general sentiment of blame and approval a perhaps very faint preference for state of affairs of one kind and against ones of another kind as for the thinkers who so earnestly maintain that mankind be predominantly selfishthey wont be scandalize by hear of the weak sentiments of virtue implant in our nature on the contrary those philosophers be as ready to maintain the one tenet as the other and their wish to mock mankind for that not corruption seem to be what drive them naturally give rise to both opinions which be closely link and can hardly be separate one of the tenets be the thesis that human be be predominantly selfish what be the other a that human be in general have some sentiment of benevolence or b that human be in general have a very weak sentiment of benevolence all hume have lay a foundation for be a but the last two sentence of the paragraph require b he have move across by go from a however weak these generous sentiments be to b by hear of the weak sentiments of virtue implant in our nature avarice ambition vanity and all the passions that be commonly though wrongly classify as kinds of selflove be exclude from my theory concern the origin of morals not because they be too weak but because they arent in the right way directional let me explain the notion of morals imply some sentiment that all mankind have a sentiment that produce general approvalapproval by everyone or nearly everyonefor the very same object it also imply some sentiment that be aim at all mankind a sentiment that lead us to applaud or censure the action and conduct of people any people even ones who be far away accord to whether they do or dont conform to the rule of right that be establish the only thing in the human makeup that satisfy these two requirements be the sentiment of humanity that i be emphasize here everyone have it and we have it towards everyone the other passions produce in everyone many strong sentiments of desire and aversion affection and hatred but they cant be the basis for any general system and establish theory of blame or approval because they satisfy neither nor when a man refer to someone else as my enemy my rival my antagonist my adversary he be understand to be speak the language of selflove he be express sentiments that be specifically his and arise from his particular circumstances and situation but when he characterize someone as vicious or odious or deprave he be speak a different language and express sentiments that he expect to be share by all who hear him in this second case therefore he must depart from his private and particular situation and choose a point of view that be common to him and the others he must what hume write next move some universal principle of the human frame and touch a string to which all mankind have an accord and symphony what he mean set move some actiongenerator that be build into the human constitution and pluck a string that be tune to a note that will resonate with all mankind if what he mean to express be that this man have qualities whose tendency be harmful to society then he have do what be need for this to be proper moral speech that be he have choose a common point of view and have touch the principle of humanity that be find in some degree in everyone for as long as the human heart be make out of the same elements as at present it wont ever be wholly indifferent to public good or entirely unaffected by the likely consequences of character and manners this feel of humanity may not generally be credit with as much strength as vanity or ambition but because it be common to all men it be the only possible basis for morals ie of any general system of blame or praise your ambition be not mine and something that would satisfy yours wouldnt satisfy mine but your humanity be mine and be everyonesthe same things arouse this passion in all human creatures in this context humanity refer not to the property of be human but rather to the feel of benevolence towards all human be and the sentiments that arise from humanity be not only the same in all human creatures and produce in them the same approval or censure but they be also direct at all human creatures so that theres noone whose conduct or character isnt open to be censure or approve by everyone in contrast with that the passions that be standardly call selfish produce different sentiments in each individual accord to his particular situation and also contemplate most of mankind with the utmost indifference and unconcern whoever have a high regard and esteem for me flatter my vanity whoever express contempt embarrass and displease me but these feel connect me with only a small part of mankindthe majority of mankind cant be target of such feel because they dont even know my name but if you present me with an account of tyrannical insolent or barbarous behaviour in any country at any time that quickly carry my thoughts to the harmful consequences of such conduct and i feel the sentiment of repugnance and displeasure towards it noone can be so remote from me that his character and conduct be wholly indifferent to me i will always be draw to whatever be beneficial to society or to the person himself and every quality or action of every human be must in this way be put into some classgiven some labelthat express general censure or applause what more can we ask therefore to distinguish the sentiments that depend on humanity from the ones connect with any other passion or to explain to us why the former and not the latter be the origin of morals whatever conduct get my approval by touch my humanity procure also the applause of all mankind by affect the same principle in them whereas what serve my greed or ambition please these passions in me alone and have no effect on the avarice and ambition of the rest of mankind there be no conduct in any man provide it have a beneficial tendency that isnt agreeable to my humanity however remote from me the man be but if a man be remote enough from me not to thwart or help my greed and ambition those passions of mine pay no attention to him when we have such a large and obvious distinction between two kinds of sentiment language be bind to follow its contour and to invent a set of term specifically to express sentiments of one of the two kindsspecifically the universal sentiments of censure or approval that arise from humanity ie from view of general usefulness and its opposite and so virtue and vice become know morals be recognize certain general ideas of human conduct be form on these ideas we base rule of conduct that men be expect to measure up to we judge that this action conform to our abstract rule while that one doesnt and the particular sentiments of selflove be often control and limit by such universal principles or rule from instance of popular tumults seditions factions panic and all passions that be share with a multitude we can learn the influence of society in arouse and support any emotion and from the same source we can also learn that the most ungovernable disorder grow from the slightest and most frivolous cause the athenian ruler solon deal harshly with people who didnt take side in a civil war but i dont think many people would get into trouble in that way if their feel and ways of talk be allow to count in their favour in a civil war no selfishness and hardly any philosophy have sufficient force to keep one entirely cool and indifferent someone who in that situation didnt catch fire from the common blaze would have to be more than a manor less than a man so its no wonder that moral sentiments be find to have such influence in life although they come from source that may at first sight appear somewhat small and delicate but remember that these principles be social and universal they form in a manner the party of mankind against vice or disorder mankinds common enemy and because the benevolent concern for others be spread in a greater or lesser degree through all men and be the same in all it crop up more often in discourse be cherish by society and conversation and that have the effect that the blame and approval that depend on it be rouse from the lethargy into which they be probably lull in solitary and uncultivated nature hume be refer to a theoretical state of nature in which men be solitary and primitive he isnt necessarily assume that there be or ever be such a it seem certain both from reason and from experience that a rough unteach savage regulate his love and hatred chiefly by the ideas of benefit to him and harm to him and have only a faint conception of a general rule or system of behaviour his attitude to the man who stand against him in battle the enemy for short be this he hat the enemy heartily not only for the present moment which be almost unavoidable but for ever after and he wont settle for anything less than extreme punishment and vengeance for the enemy now consider how we accustom to society and to take broader view regard someone the enemy again who oppose us in battle we bear in mind that the enemy be serve his own country and community that any man in the same situation would do the same and that include us and that it be best for human society in general if men do conform to such maxims as that a man should fight for his country when call upon and with the help of these suppositions and view we somewhat correct our rougher and narrower position which be like those of the savage and though much of our friendship and enmity be still govern by private considerations of benefit and harm we at least pay a certain homage to the general rule that we be accustom to respect i mean the homage of pervert our adversarys conduct by impute malice or injustice to him so as to give vent to passions arise from selflove and private interest when the heart be full of rage it be never short of pretences of this nature state other passions be selfish and private and that have the result that the social and public benevolent concern often overpower them and take command of our emotional state even when the other passions be stronger at their outset another spring of our constitution that add a lot of force to moral sentiments be the love of fame which rule with such uncontrolled authority in all generous mind and be often the grand object of all their design and undertake a person with a generous mind in the sense in which hume mean that word be someone whose aim and aspirations have scope and grandeur whose thoughts be broad and deep and sweep whose ambition be not hem in by caution we dont have any one word that capture it some use of the word earlier in this work may also carry that mean though they could all be understand in the sense that generous have today by our continual and earnest pursuit of a character a name a reputation in the world we frequently review our own conduct and consider how it appear in the eye of people who come in contact with us this constant habit of survey our own reflection so to speak keep alive all the sentiments of right and wrong and create in people with noble natures a certain reverence not only for others but for themselvesand this be the surest guardian of every virtue the animal conveniences and pleasures sink gradually in their value while every inward beauty and moral grace be carefully acquire and the mind come to be equip with every perfection that can adorn or embellish a rational creature here be the most perfect morality we know here be display the force of many sympathies our moral sentiment be itself a feel chiefly of that nature those be hum exact eleven word and our concern for be in good stand with other people seem to arise only from our concern for be in good stand with ourselves want to be on good term with ourselves we find that our shaky judgment have to be prop up by the correspond approval of mankind suppose for purpose of argument that all these reason of mine be false i shall now adopt the follow stance i be simply wrong when i say that the sentiments of humanity and sympathy be the source of our pleasure in thoughts or prospect of utility i have to find some other explanation of our applause for thingswhether inanimate animate or rational that have a tendency to promote the welfare and advantage of mankind it sound absurd to suppose that an object be approve of because of its tendency produce a certain end while the end itself be a matter of total indifference but let us swallow this absurdity in order to see where it take us the description or definition that i have give of personal merit be still evidently true and authoritative it must still be concede that every quality of the mind that be useful or agreeable to the person himself or to others communicate pleasure to the spectator command his esteem and be accept under the honourable label virtue and merit why be justice fidelity honour truthfulness faithfulness and chastity hold in such high esteem isnt it because of their tendency to promote the good of society isnt that tendency inseparable from humanity benevolence gentleness generosity gratitude moderation tenderness friendship and all the other social virtues can it possibly be doubt that industry discretion frugality order perseverance forethought judgment and this whole class of virtues and accomplishments that it would take many page to listcan it be doubt i repeat that the tendency of these qualities to promote the interest and happiness of the person who have them be the whole basis for their merit compare a mind that support a perpetual serenity and cheerfulness a noble dignity and undaunted spirit a tender affection and goodwill to everyone within reach with a mind that be deject with melancholy torment with anxiety irritate with rage or sink into the most abject baseness and degeneracy who can dispute that the former have more enjoyment within itself and be also a more animate and joygiving spectacle to others as for the qualities that be immediately agreeable to others they speak sufficiently for themselves and if you have never perceive the charm of a humorous wit or flow affability of a delicate modesty or decent genteelness of speech and manner you must be very unfortunate either in the temperament you have or in the company you keep im aware that nothing can be more unphilosophical than to be positive or dogmatic on any subject and that even excessive scepticism suppose it could be maintain wouldnt be more destructive of all sound reason and inquiry than dogmatism be im convince that where men be the most sure and arrogant be generally where they be the most mistake its because they have give passion a free rein without the proper deliberation and suspension of judgment that be their only protection against the grossest absurdities but i must confess that my fouritem list put the matter in so strong a light that i cant at present be more assure of any truth that i have learn from reason and argument than i be that personal merit consist entirely in the usefulness or agreeableness of qualities to the person who have them or to other people who interact with him but i remind myself that although the size and shape of the earth have be measure and describe the motion of the tide have be explain the order and system of the heavenly body have be bring under their proper laws and infinity itself have be reduce to calculation men be still argue about the foundation of their moral duties when i think about that i fall back from dogmatism into diffidence and scepticism and suspect that any hypothesis as obvious as mine would if it be true have receive long ago the unanimous vote of mankind have explain the moral approval that come with merit or virtue my only remain task be briefly to consider how if at all our interest create an obligation to conform to morality the question be this for any man who have any concern for his own happiness and welfare the best course of action be for him to perform every moral duty true or false if the answer true can be clearly derive from my theory ill have the satisfaction of know that i have advance principles that dont just i hope stand the test of reason and inquiry but also may contribute to the amendment of mens live and their improvement in morality and social virtue let me reflect for a moment on the relation between true and salutary the philosophical truth of a proposition never depend on its tendency to promote the interest of society but a proposition that have the opposite tendency though it may be true perhaps ought not to be make public only a very nasty man would publicly deliver a theoryeven a perfectly true onethat he have to admit will lead to conduct that be dangerous and harmful why explore the corner of nature that spread nastiness all around why dig up the diseasecarrying stuff from the pit in which it be bury the skill of your research may be admire but your system will be detest and mankind will agree that if they cant refute it they can at least bury it in eternal silence and oblivion and theycan do that because truths that be harmful to society if there be any will be overcome by falsehoods that be salutary and helpful but no philosophical truths could be more advantageous to society than the ones i have present here they represent virtue in all her genuine and most engage charm and make us approach her with ease familiarity and affection she lose the dismal dress that she have be cover with by many theologians and some philosophers so that all we see be virtue in all her gentleness humanity beneficence and kindly politenesseven sometimes her play frolic and gaiety she doesnt talk to us of useless austerities and rigours suffer and selfdenial she declare that her sole purpose be to make her devote and all mankind cheerful and happy during every instant of their existence if possible and she never willingly part with any pleasure except to get ample compensation at some other period in the persons life the only trouble that she require us to take be that of accurate calculation which we sometimes need if we be to maintain a steady preference for the greater happiness and if she be approach by wouldbe moralists who be enemies to joy and pleasure she either reject them as hypocrites and deceivers or if she admit them to her circle she rank them among the least favour of her devote enough of metaphors what hop can we ever have of draw mankind into a way of life that we admit to be full of austerity and rigour what theory of morals can ever serve any useful purpose unless it can show in detail that all the duties that it recommend be also the true interest of each individual the unique advantage of my system seem to be that it furnish a proper basis for that result theres presumably no need to argue that the virtues that be immediately useful or agreeable to the person who have them be desirable from the point of view of selfinterest moralists can spare themselves all the trouble they often take in recommend these duties whats the point of collect arguments to show that temperance be advantageous and that the excesses of pleasure be harmful when its obvious that these excesses be only call excesses because they be hurtful and that if the unlimited use of rum for example do no more harm to ones health or the faculties of ones mind and body than the use of air or water it wouldnt be a whit more vicious or blameable there also seem to be no need to argue that the companionable virtues of good manners and wit decency and genteelness be more desirable than the contrary qualities our vanity alone without any other consideration be a sufficient motive to make us want to have these accomplishments no man be ever willingly lack in them all our failures here proceed from bad upbringing lack of abilities or a perverse and rigid disposition do i want my company to be want admire follow rather than hat despise avoid can anyone seriously deliberate about this just as no enjoyment be sincere without some reference to company and society so no society can be agreeableor even tolerablewhen a man feel that his presence in it be unwelcome and discover all around him symptoms of disgust and aversion but why shouldnt all this hold just as well for the greater society or gettogether of mankind as well as for particular club and gather i have be argue for this the limit endowments of ingenuity and politeness be desirable from the point of view of happiness and selfinterest why if we be sure of that would we doubt this the enlarge virtues of humanity generosity and beneficence be desirable from the point of view of happiness and selfinterest be we afraid that those social affections will interfere with private utility to a greater extent and in a more immediate way than any other pursuits so that they cant be gratify without some important sacrifice of honour and advantage if so we arent well inform about the nature of the human passions and be more influence by verbal distinctions than by real differences whatever contradiction may be commonly think to exist between selfish sentiments or dispositions and social ones theres really no more conflict between those two than there be between selfish and ambitious selfish and revengeful selfish and vain what hume write next it be requisite that there be an original propensity of some kind in order to be a basis to selflove by give a relish to the object of its pursuit and none more fit for this purpose than benevolence or humanity what he seem to have mean a persons selflove or selfishness be active only when he selfishly pursue his goals but he cant have any such goals unless he haslying deeper within him than his selflovesome sort of lean or like or preference for somethingorother and the best candidate for that role be benevolence or humanity ie a lean or like for the welfare of mankind the goods that the world bring us be spend in one gratification or another the miser who accumulate his annual income and lend it out at interest have really spend it in the gratification of his greed and it would be hard to show why a man lose more by a generous action than by any other method of expense since the most he can achieve by the most elaborate selfishness be the gratification of some like suppose that you have full power to model your own disposition now deliberate about what appetite or desire you would choose to be the basis for your happiness and enjoyment the lean or like refer to above youll want to have some appetite or desire a life without passion would be altogether insipid and tiresome youll have notice that every like when gratify by success give a satisfaction proportional to the force and violence of the like thats an advantage that every like have so it doesnt favour benevolence over any of its rival but it have other advantage that do select it out of the herd the immediate feel of benevolence and friendship humanity and kindness be sweet smooth tender and agreeable come what may these virtues be also accompany by a please awareness or memory while we retain the pleasant think of have do our part for mankind and society that keep us on good term with ourselves as well as with others if we devote ourselves to try to satisfy our greed and ambition we may have successes that all men will resent but we can be almost sure of their goodwill and good wish so long as we persevere in the paths of virtue and devote ourselves to generous plan and purpose what other passion be there that bring together so many advantagesan agreeable sentiment a please consciousness a good reputation but men be pretty much convince of these truths without help from me and when they be deficient in their duty not want to be generous friendly and humane its because they dont feel that they be generous friendly or humane treat vice with the utmost fairness and make all possible concessions to it we must acknowledge that there be never the slightest pretextfrom the point of view of selfinterestfor prefer it to virtue except perhaps in the case of justice where a man may often seem to be a loser by his integrity it be agree that no society could survive without a respect for property but because of the imperfect way in which human affairs be conduct it could happen in a particular case that a sensible knave think that a dishonest or treacherous act will make a considerable addition to his fortune without greatly weaken the bond that hold society together the phrase sensible knave be a kind of technical term in the write of hume and of many who have come after him it refer to a bad man who give some think to what he be do the thesis that honesty be the best policymeaning best from the selfinterested point of viewis a good general rule but there be many exceptions to it and it might be think that the wisest person be the one who obey the general rule except for take advantage of all the exceptions i must confess that if someone think that this line of think need an answer it wont be easy to find one that will convince him if his heart doesnt rebel against such harmful maxims if he doesnt shrink from the think of villainy or baseness he have indeed lose a considerable motive to virtue and we may expect that his behaviour will fit in with his doctrine that he should be honest except where it be better for him to be dishonest but in all openly honest natures the dislike for treachery and roguery be too strong to be counterbalance by any view of personal profit or monetary advantage inward peace of mind consciousness of integrity a satisfactory review of our own conductthese be all very much require for happiness and will be cherish and cultivate by every honest man who feel the importance of them such a person will also have the frequent satisfaction of see knaves with all their suppose cunning and abilities betray by their own maxims a knave who intend only to cheat with moderation and secrecy will come across a tempt opportunity to go further nature be frail and hell fall into the snare from which he can never extricate himself without a total loss of reputation and the forfeiture of all future trust and confidence with mankind but even if a knave be ever so secret and successful an honest man if he have the slightest touch of philosophy or even just common observation and reflection will discover that the knave be in the last analysis the greatest dupe have sacrifice the priceless enjoyment of a good characterat least in his own eyesin return for the acquisition of worthless toy and trinkets so little be need to supply the necessities of nature and from the point of view of pleasure there be no comparison between the feverish empty amusements of luxury and big spend and the unbought satisfaction of conversation society study even health and the common beauties of nature but above all the peaceful reflection on ones own conduct these natural pleasures indeed be really pricelessit cost nothing to get them and the enjoyment of them be above all price appendix moral sentiment or feel if my theory be accept that will make it easy for us to answer the question with which i beganthe one about whether our morality arise from reason or from sentiment or feel or from both i postpone answer that question because i think it might involve us in intricate speculations that be unfit for moral discourse but now i come back to it and examine how far either reason or sentiment enter into all decisions of praise or censure one principal basis for moral praise lie in the usefulness of the quality or action be praise so obviously reason must play a considerable part in all decisions of this kind why because only reason can instruct us about the tendency causal properties of qualities and action and point out their beneficial consequences to society and to the person who have them or do them there be often a great deal of controversy about this doubt may arise conflict interest may come into it and one of the options have to be choose on the basis of fine detail and a small difference in utility this be especially noticeable with question about justicewhich be what its natural to expect give the kind of utility that this virtue involve more about that in appendix if every individual instance of justice be useful to society in the way that every individual instance of benevolence be this would simplify things and not involve much controversy but that be not how things stand it often happen that a single instance of justice be harmful in its first and immediate consequences and bring advantage to society only through the observance of the general rule of which it be an instance so that the advantage require that many people will act in accordance with that rule which mean that the casethe weigh up of pros and consbecomes more intricate and involve the many detail about how society work consequences of any general practice and interest that may come into it these be often doubtful and subject to great discussion and inquiry the object of civil laws be to settle all the question about justice the debate among laypeople the thoughts of politicians the precedents of history and public record be all direct to the same purpose and in many case a very precise reason or judgment be need for the right solution to be find when there be such intricate doubt arise from obscure or opposite utilities but although reasonwhen its in good shape and properly usedis all we need for learn about the harmful or useful tendency of qualities and action its not enough on its own to produce any moral blame or approval utility be only a tendency to produce a certain end if that end be totally indifferent to us we would feel the same indifference towards the mean to get a preference for the useful as against the harmful tendencies some kind of sentiment have to be at work the sentiment in question cant be anything but a feel for the happiness of mankind and a resentment of their misery since happiness and misery be the different end that virtue and vice have a tendency to promote in these contexts then reason instruct us in the various tendencies of action and humanity make a distinction in favour of the ones that be useful and beneficial this partition between the faculties of understand and of sentiment in all moral decisions seem clear from the theory about the origin of morals that i have be defend in this work but let us suppose that my theory be false and start look for some other satisfactory theory and im will to risk the claim that we wont find one as long as we suppose reason to be the sole source of morals in support of this consider the five follow point a false hypothesis can easily maintain some appearance of truth as long as it be state only in general term use undefined term and employ comparisons instead of instance this be conspicuously the case with the philosophy that regard reason as the sole source of moral distinctions with no input from sentiment however plausible this theory may be in general declamations and discourse when it be apply to any particular instance it cant even be render intelligible let alone be show to be true examine the crime of ingratitude for instance in this context hume be use crime for any episode of morally wrong conduct or think or feel it have no special link with the criminal law of the state this occur whenever we observe on one side goodwill express and know together with help give and on the other illwill or indifference and harm do or at least no help give anatomize all these factsanalyse them as finely as you likeand try through your reason alone to discover what there be thats bad or blameworthy about this conduct youll never come to any issue or conclusion reason make judgments concern matter of fact and relations let start by ask in a case of ingratitude where be the matter of fact that we be call a crime point it out determine the time when it occur describe its essence or nature explain the sense or faculty to which it be reveal the ingratitude reside in the mind of the person who be ungrateful so he must feel it be conscious of it but theres nothing there except the frame of mind of illwill or absolute indifference you cant say that these all by themselves always and in all circumstances be crimes no they be crimes only when we direct them towards people who have previously express and display goodwill towards us so we can infer that the crime of ingratitude be not any particular individual fact it arise from a complex of circumstances which when observe by a spectator arouse in him the sentiment of blamethis be something that happen because of the particular structure and texture of his mind you may say what you have just say be false somethings be a crime doesnt indeed consist in a particular fact that we be assure of by reason but it do consist in certain moral relations that reason discover just as we discover by reason the truths of geometry or algebra but what relations be you talk about in the case describe i see first goodwill and help in one person then illwill and harm in the other between these there be a relation of contrariety do the crime consist in that relation but suppose a person bore me illwill or do me harm and i in return be indifferent towards him or give him help here be the same relation of contrariety and yet my conduct be often highly praiseworthy twist and turn this matter as much as you will you can never base morality on relations you have to bring in the decisions of sentiment when someone say that two and three be equal to half of ten i understand this relation of equality perfectly i have the think that if ten be divide into two part of which one have as many units as the other and if either of these part be compare with two add to three it will contain as many units as that compound number but when you invite me to compare this with moral relations i admit that im altogether at a loss to understand you a moral actiona crime such as ingratitudeis a complex object do the morality consist in the relation of its part to each other how in what way specify the relationbe more particular and explicit in your propositionsand youll easily see their falsehood you reply no the morality consist in the relation of action to the rule of right and they be label good or bad accord to whether they do or dont conform to that rule in that case what be this rule of right what do it consist in how do we discover it by reason you say which examine the moral relations of action so moral relations be determine by relate action to a rule and that rule be determine by consider the moral relations of object isnt this fine reason all this be metaphysics you say that be enough to make it very likely that what you say be false i reply yes we be certainly involve in metaphysics but it all come from youfrom your advance an obscure hypothesis that can never be make intelligible or fit to any particular instance or example my hypothesis be plain it say that morality be determine by sentiment or feel it define virtue as whatever mental action or quality give to a spectator the please sentiment of approval and it define vice as whatever mental action or quality give to a spectator the unpleasing sentiment of disapproval i then proceed to examine a plain matter of fact namely what action have this influence i consider the feature share by all the action we call virtuous and the feature share by all that we call vicious or wrong and try to extract from some general truths about these sentiments of approval and disapproval if you call this metaphysics and find anything in it obscure you should conclude that you dont have the right sort of mind for the systematic study of human behaviour think about someone who be deliberate about whether in a particular emergency he should help his brother or his benefactorhe cant help both in order to settle where his duty lieswhich of the two he have a great obligation tohe must consider the relations brother of and benefactor of and all the facts about what his brother and his benefactor be like and how they be situate now compare that with this in order to determine the proportion of line in a triangle one must examine the nature of that triangle and the relation its different part have to each other the two procedures look similar but basically they be enormously different someone engage in theoretical reason about triangles or circle consider the various know and give interrelations of the part of these figure and from them he infer some previously unknown relation which follow from the know ones but to engage in moral deliberation we must be already be acquaint with all the relevant object and all their interrelations and from put all this together we fix our choice of what to do or our approval of what someone have do for example to deliberate about whether to help my brother or my benefactor i must know the facts about each and about all the relevant relations i have to each theres no new fact to be ascertain no new relation to be discover all the detail of the case be suppose to be lay before us before we assign blame or approval if any relevant fact about the situation be still unknown or doubtful we must first use our intellectual faculties to get it settle suspend all moral decision or sentiment hum exact fiveword phrase until that have be do be x an aggressor against y until we get that settle how can we determine whether ys kill of x be criminal or innocent but when every detail fact and every relation be know theres nothing leave for the understand to do no question for it to work on the approval or blame that ensue cant be the intellectual work of the faculty of judgment but the work of the heart its not a speculative theoretical proposition or assertion but an active feel or sentiment in the activities of the understand we infer something new and previously unknown from facts and relations that be know in moral decisions all the facts and relations must be know already and the mind go from its contemplation of all of this to feel some new impression of affection or disgust admiration or contempt approval or blame hence the great difference between a mistake about what action be right and a mistake about what the facts be and hence also the reason why the former kind of mistake be commonly criminal and the latter be not when oedipus kill laius he didnt know that laius be his father facts about the situation that werent his fault lead to his have false beliefs about the action he perform but when nero kill his mother agrippina all the relations between himself and her and all the factual detail be already know to him but in his savage heart the motive of revenge or fear or selfinterest prevail over the sentiments of duty and humanity and when we express our detestation of him its not because we see any relations that he didnt see rather our upright frame of mind cause us to feel sentiments against which he have become harden by flattery and a long history of enormous crimes so all moral determinations consist in these sentiments and not in a discovery of relations of any kind before we can form any decision of this kind all the facts about the action and its circumstances must already be know and then all we have to do be to feel some sentiment of blame or approval on the basis of which we pronounce the action criminal or virtuous the truth of my theory will become still more evident if we compare moral beauty with natural beauty which so closely resemble it in many respect all natural beauty depend on the proportion relations and position of part but it would be absurd to infer from this that the perception of beauty like that of truth in geometrical problems consist wholly in the perception of relations and be perform entirely by the understand or intellectual faculties in all the sciences our mind investigate unknown relations of things on the basis of relations that be know but in all decisions of taste or external beauty all the relations be already obvious to the eye and we move from them to feel a sentiment of satisfaction or disgust depend on what the object in question be like and on the state of our senseorgans euclid have fully explain all the qualities of the circle but none of his theorems say a word about its beauty the reason be clear beauty be not a quality of the circleit be nowhere to be find in any part of the line whose part be equidistant from a common centre a circle beauty be only the effect that it produce in the mind which be build in such a way as to be liable to have such sentiments youd be waste your time if you look for beauty in the circle try through your sense or through mathematical reason to detect it in the properties of that figure attend to the architects palladio and perrault when they explain all the part and proportion of a pillar they talk of the cornice and frieze and base and entablature etc and describe and locate each of these part of the pillar but if you ask them to describe and locate the pillars beauty they would immediately reply that the beauty isnt in any of the pillars part but result from the whole thing when that complex figure be present to an intelligent mind that be liable to have those finer sensations hum word until such a spectator turn up there be nothing but a figure of such and such dimension and proportion its from the spectators sentimentsand only from themthat the elegance and beauty of the pillar arise now attend to the orator cicero when he depict the crimes of the corrupt politician verres or the seditious conspirator catiline you must admit that the moral baseness resultslike the beauty of the pillarfrom the contemplation of the whole when present to someone whose organs have a particular structure and formation the orator may paint rage insolence barbarity on one side and meekness suffer sorrow and innocence on the other but if you dont feel indignation or compassion arise in you from this complex of facts it wouldnt do you any good to ask the orator what be the crime or villainy that you be so vehemently attack when do it come into existence and who be its subject now a few months later that every disposition and think of all the people involve be totally alter or annihilate what have become of the crime the abstract hypothesis of moralsie the theory that moral conclusions be establish by reasoncant give a satisfactory answer to any of these question eventually we have to admit that the crime or immorality rather than be a particular fact or relation that can be investigate by the understand arise entirely from the sentiment of disapproval that we unavoidably feel when we learn about barbarity or treachery what make this feel unavoidable be the structure of human nature inanimate object can relate to each other in all the ways that moral agents can but they cant be the object of love or hatred and so they arent capable of merit or iniquity hume here use inanimate in one of its old sense to mean nonbreathing roughly nonanimal a young tree that overtop and destroy its parent stand in all the same relations as nero do when he murder his mother and if morality consist merely in relations the young tree would no doubt be equally criminal it seem clear that the ultimate end of human action cant in any single case be account for by reason and submit themselves entirely to the sentiments and affections of mankind without depend in any way on our intellectual faculties heres an example to help you grasp the idea of an ultimate end ask a man why do you take exercise and he will answer because i want to keep my health ask him why do you want health and he will readily reply because sickness be painful if you now push on and ask him why do you hate pain he cant possibly answer this be an ultimate end and be never regard as a special case of something more general he might give to the question why do you want health a different answer namely because i need it to do my job if you ask why do you care about that he will answer because i want to earn money if you demand why he will say that money be the instrument of pleasure and beyond this it would be absurd to ask for a reason there cant possibly be a progress ad infinitum with each desire be base on a reason that consist in a desire for something else something must be desirable on its own account because of its immediate fit with human sentiment and affection now virtue be an end it be desirable on its own account without fee or reward purely for the immediate satisfaction it give so there have to be some sentiment that it trigger some internal taste or feelingor whatever you want to call itthat distinguish moral good from moral evil embrace the one and reject the other so we can easily establish the domain and the role of reason and the domain and role of taste or feel the former provide knowledge of truth and falsehood the latter yield the sentiment of beauty and ugliness vice and virtue reason discover object as they really be in nature not add or take away anything whereas feel or taste produce something add something it gild or paint natural object with colour borrow from internal sentiment and so it in a way create something new reason be cool and disengage so it isnt a motive to action its only link with action be that it direct the impulse it receive from appetite or inclination show us the mean to attain happiness or avoid misery taste or feel far from be cool give pleasure or pain so it constitute happiness or misery and therefore act as a motive to action it be indeed the first spring or impulsethe initial starterfor desire and volition from factual detail and relations that be know or suppose reason lead us to the discovery of truths that be conceal and unknown after all the factual detail and relations be lay before us taste or feel make us feel a new sentiment of blame or approval the standard of reason be found on the nature of things be eternal and inflexiblenot even the will of the supreme be can alter it the standard of taste or feel presumably could be alter by god if he choose to alter it it arise from the eternal makeup and constitution of animals so it be ultimately derive from the supreme will that give each species of animal its special nature and arrange the various class and order of existence appendix selflove theres a principle say to be accept by many people that be utterly incompatible with all virtue or moral sentiment it cant come from anything but the most deprave disposition in the person who maintain it and in its turn it tend still further to encourage that depravity the principle be this all benevolence be mere hypocrisy friendship a cheat public spirit a farce fidelity a snare to procure trust and confidence basically all of us pursue only our private interest but we wear these fair disguise so as to put others off their guard and make them even more vulnerable to our trick and scheme its easy to imagine what kind of heart a man must have if he believe this and feel no internal sentiment that contradict this harmful theory and to imagine his level of affection and benevolence towards a species that he paint in such revolt colour and suppose to be so unlikely to return the affection or be grateful for any good that be do for them or if someones acceptance of this principle doesnt come entirely from a corrupt heart he must have be lead by the most careless and rush examination of the human scene it could happen like this a superficial reasoner observe many false pretences among mankind he doesnt feel within himself any strong resistance to his act in such a way so he rush to the general conclusion that the whole species be equally corrupt and that men unlike all other animalsindeed unlike all other thingscant be distinguish from one another as better or worse not even slightly better or worse because under their various disguise and appearances they be all from the evaluative point of view the same another somewhat similar principle have be much insist on by philosophers and have be the foundation of many a system it be this whatever affection one may feel or imagine one feel for others there arent and cant be any disinterested not self interest feel the most generous friendship however sincere be a version of selflove even when we appear to be deeply engage in scheme for the liberty and happiness of mankind all we be really seek though we may not be aware of this be our own gratification by a turn of imagination or a refinement of reflection or an enthusiasm of passion we seem to do things in the interest of others and imagine that we be free of all selfish considerations but basically the most generous patriot and the most niggardly miser the bravest hero and the feeblest coward be equally concern with their own happiness and welfare in everything that they do this look like a damagecausing opinion which might lead you to think that anyone who announce it as his opinion cant possibly feel the true sentiments of benevolence or have any regard for genuine virtue but that conclusion turn out to be false probity and honour be no strangers to epicurus and his followers atticus and horace seem to have have by nature and to have develop through reflection dispositions that be as generous and friendly as any those of disciples of the sterner school and among the moderns hobbes and locke maintain the selfish theory of morals yet live irreproachable live and hobbes be not in a position to have the defect of his philosophy make up for by the restraints of religion an epicurean or a hobbesian freely agree that there be such a thing as a friendship in the world without hypocrisy or disguise though he may attempt through a philosophical chemistry to analyse this passion into elements that belong to some other passion and to explain every affection as a case of selflove that be twist and mould by a particular turn of imagination into a variety of appearances people imaginations differ in ways that affect how the basic passion be redirect so that even accord to this selfish theory mens character can differ widelywith one man be virtuous and humane another vicious and meanly selfinterested i admire the man whose selflove be somehow so direct as to give him a concern for others and render him useful to society i hate or despise the one who have no regard for anything but his own gratifications and enjoyments its no use your suggest that these seemingly opposite character be basically the same their only difference come from a very inconsiderable turn of think each character appear to me to be in practice pretty stable even if it do rest on a minor fact about how the persons imagination work and i dont find in this context any more than i do in others that the natural sentiments arise from the general appearances of things be easily destroy by subtle reflections on the fine detail of the origins of these appearances doesnt the lively cheerful colour of someones face give me satisfaction and pleasure even if i learn from science that differences in complexion all arise from tiny differences of thickness in tiny part of the skin make differences in which colour of the spectrum be absorb and which be reflect so the question concern the universal or partial selfishness of man doesnt make as much real difference to morality and conduct as it be usually think to do still it be certainly of consequence in the theoretical study of human nature and be a proper object of curiosity and enquiry so it may be worthwhile to offer a few thoughts about it here the most obvious objection to the selfish hypothesis be this because it be contrary to common feel and our natural untutored thoughts and be therefore an extraordinary paradox it couldnt be establish without the highest stretch of philosophy without support from lengthy elaborate and difficult philosophical argument to the most casual observer there appear to be such dispositions as benevolence and generosity such affections as love friendship compassion and gratitude the cause effect object and operations of these sentiments be mark by common language and observation and be plainly distinguish from the cause etc of the selfish passions this be the obvious appearance of things and we should just accept it unless and until some hypothesis be discover that can penetrate deep enough into human nature to show that the former affections be nothing but special case of the latter noone have yet succeed in do that though many have triedapparently because of the love of simplicity that have be the source of much false reason in philosophy i shant here go into detail about that many able philosophers have show up the failures of these simplify theories the view that ill be take for grant be one that i think the slightest reflection will make obvious to every impartial enquirer in this paragraph philosophy and philosopher probably also cover science and scientists anyway the nature of the subject create the strongest presumption that no better system will ever be invent that will explain the benevolent feel as arise from the selfish ones and thus reduce all the various emotions of the human mind to a perfect simplicity the situation in this area of philosophy be quite different from the situation in physics many an hypothesis in natural science have appear false at first and then after more accurate scrutiny find to be solid and satisfactory this happen so often that a judicious and witty philosopher fontenelle have go so far as to say that if theres more than one way in which a phenomenon could be produce theres a general presumption that it be produce by the least obvious and familiar of them but the presumption always lie on the other side in all enquiries into the origin of our passions and of the internal operations of the human mind in that context the simplest and most obvious causal story about any give phenomenon be probably the true one when a philosopher in set out his system have to avail himself of some very intricate and refine reflections and to suppose them to be essential to the production of some passion or emotion beware in such a case we have reason to be alertly on our guard against a false theory our affections cant be affect by refine activities of benevolence naturally divide into two kindsgeneral and particular my general benevolence towards someone occur when im not his friend be not connect with him and be not one of his admirers but feel a general sympathy with him be sorry about his pain and rejoice with him over his pleasures my particular benevolence towards someone be base on my think that he be virtuous or on help that he have give me or on some special connection between us theres no deny that both these sentiments be real aspects of human nature the question of whether they be really subtle versions of selflove be interest to study rather than practically important in the course of this inquiry i shall often have occasion to refer to general benevolence or humanity or sympathy and my general experience lead me to assume without further argument that it be real reason or imagination what we always find be that a vigorous exertion of the faculties of reason or imagination bring affections feel to a halt this be bind to happen because of the narrow capacity of the human mind its true that quite often our predominant motive or intention be conceal from ourselves when its mix in with other motives which the mind from vanity or selfconceit want to think be more prevalent but such concealment of ones own motives from oneself have never happen because of the abstruseness and intricacy of the motive a man who have lose a friend and patron may be flatter himself when he think that all his grief arise from generous sentiments with no admixture of selfinterested considerations but when a man grieve for a valuable friend whose patron and protector he wasie when the benefit have be flow in the opposite directionhow can we think that his passionate tenderness arise from some metaphysical relation to a selfinterest that he doesnt actually have we may as well imagine that tiny wheel and spring like those of a watch be what make a load wagon move as account for the origin of passion from such abstruse reflections animals be find to be capable of kindness to their own species and to ours and theres no suspicion that this involve disguise or playact be we to account for all their sentiments too in term of refine versions of selfinterest and if we admit a disinterested benevolence in the lower species by what rule of analogy can we refuse it in the higher love between the sex generate a satisfaction and goodwill that be quite different from the gratification of an appetite in all sentient be tenderness towards their offspring be commonly able to outweigh the strongest motivesneglec of selflove and doesnt in any way arise from selflove consider this case a fond mother lose her health through the hard work of nurse her sick child the child die and the mother languish and die of grief remember that the childs death free her from the slavery of care for it around the clock what selfinterest could possibly be at work here isnt gratitude an affection of the human breast or be gratitude merely a word with no mean or reality dont we get more satisfaction from one man company than from anothers dont we want our friend to have a happy life even if absence or death prevent us from have any part in it and in most case even while we be alive and present what give us any part in our friends good fortune other than affection and respect for him these and a thousand other examples be sign of a general benevolence in human nature in situations where no real selfinterest bind us to the object and its hard to see how a real passion or emotion can arise from an interest that the person know and admit to be imaginary no satisfactory hypothesis of this kind have be discover so far and there isnt the least probability that one will be find however hard men work at it and theres another point if you think about it properly youll see that as between these two hypotheses there be disinterested benevolence distinct from selflove all friendship and humanity be a version of selflove the one that be really simpler be not but its true that postulate only one basic feel while postulate at least two but lead to a simpler overall theory than do because it fit better into the analogy of nature in the rest of this paragraph i shall present an important very general thesis and then fit type benevolence in with it everyone agree that there be bodily want or appetites that necessarily precede all sensual enjoyment and lead us immediately to try to get whatever it be that the appetite be an appetite for for example hunger and thirst have eat and drink as the end they aim for and from the gratification of these primary appetites arise a pleasure that may become the object of another sort of desire or inclination that be secondary and selfinterested hum point in that very condense sentence be this primary appetite i be very hungry which lead me to reach up to pick an apple off a tree this isnt selfinterested conduct because the hunger lead to the action immediately rather than through any such think as it will suit my purpose very well if i pick that apple but in general when i be hungry and then eat i get pleasure from this and so secondary desire at a time when im not hungry i want to ensure that i will always have enough to eat and this want and the action it lead to be selfinterested because they do involve a think about my own interest similarly there be mental passions as distinct from physical appetites by which we be drive immediately to seek particular objectivesfame power vengeancewithout any think about what be in our interest and when these objectives be attain a please enjoyment ensue as a consequence of our get what we want for us to reap any pleasure from get fame or to pursue fame from motives of selflove and desire for happiness nature must have give us a basic inclination to go after famebasic in the sense that it isnt a special case of some more general desire or inclination why be this so its an upshot of the way the human mind be structure if i have no vanity i get no pleasure from praise if i lack ambition power give me no enjoyment if im not angry the punishment of an adversary be totally indifferent to me see note on page in each of these case theres a passion that point immediately to the objective and make the achieve of it a part of our good or happiness and then there be other secondary passions that arise afterwards and lead us to pursue the same objective as a part of our happiness once it have be make to be such by our basic affections if there be no appetite of any kind in advance ofand more basic thanselflove there would be hardly anything for selflove to do because we would have felt few pain or pleasures and no intense ones and so there would be little misery or happiness for us to avoid or to pursue well its easy to see that the same thing may be the case with benevolence and friendship the follow individual case would be part of general story because of the basic way i be build i feel a desire for your happiness or good because of that affection of mine your good become my own good and then i pursue your good from the combine motives of benevolence and selfenjoyment the basic passions and propensity that resemble our primary physical appetites be further remove from selfinterest than i have so far indicate i have make the point that they dont come from selfinterest arent versions of it but now i add that sometimes they run against selfinterest we all know that someones desire for revenge may be so strong that he seek revenge while know that he be neglect every consideration of ease interest and safety like some vindictive animals he infuse his very soul into the wound he give his enemy hume here have a footnote quote in latin horace write about the bee that leave its sting in the body of its enemy and die as a consequence and seneca write about someones neglect his own welfare in his eagerness to harm an enemy what a malignant philosophy it would be that didnt allow to humanity and friendship the same privilege that be indisputably grant to the darker passions of enmity and resentment such a philosophy may be a good foundation for paradoxical wit and tease but its a very bad one for any serious argument or reason appendix further point about justice in this appendix i plan to give some further detail about the origin and nature of justice and to mark some differences between it and the other virtues the social virtues of humanity and benevolence exert their influence immediately by a direct tendency or instinct that be focus mainly on whatever it be that have arouse the feel in question they dont bring in any theory or system or any think about the consequences of the behaviour they lead toconsequences from other people go along with the behaviour imitate it take it as an example a parent rush to help his child sweep along by the natural sympathy that drive him and doesnt give him a space in which to reflect on how the rest of mankind feel or behave in similar circumstances see note on sympathy on page a generous man cheerfully take up an opportunity to do something for his friend because at that moment he feel himself to be govern by beneficent affections he isnt concern with whether anyone else in the universe ever be drive by such noble motives or ever will be influence by his behaviour now to act in similar ways in every such case the social passions of a person x aim at a single individual objective and pursue the safety or happiness of the love and admire personof that person and noone else all x want be just that with no think of further consequences and in a correspond way the good his beneficence do arouse the moral sentiment of approval in others without their think about further consequences of xs behaviour itself or of its be a model for how other members of society might act so far from the behaviours be valuable only because others might follow suit the truth be almost the opposite if the generous friend or disinterested patriot be the only person engage in beneficence of this sort that would enhance his value in our eye the rarity and novelty of his conduct would add to the things we praise him for the case be not the same with the social virtues of justice and fidelity they be highly usefulor indeed absolutely necessaryto the wellbeing of mankind but the benefit they bring be not a consequence of every individual single act rather it arise from the whole scheme or system accept by the whole society or anyway most of it general peace and order be products of justice or the general practice of not take things that belong to others but it often happen that a particular case of respect the particular right of one individual citizen be consider in itself harmful in its consequences in a case of that sort the result of the individual act be directly opposite to that of the whole system of action the individual act may be extremely harmful although the general system of which it be a part be enormously advantageous when a bad man inherit riches from a parent this can lead to mischiefthats an individual case where right of inheritance be harmful its benefit come only from the rule be generally obey and it be sufficient here morally acceptable overall if that benefit outweigh all the bad consequences in some particular case the happiness and prosperity of mankind that arise from the social virtue of benevolence and its varieties can be compare to a wall that be build by many hand each stone that be put in place help the wall to rise and its overall increase in size depend on the diligence and care of each workman the happiness that arise from the social virtue of justice and its varieties be comparable to the build of a stone arch where each individual stone would fall to the grind if leave to itself and the whole arch be support purely by the mutual assistance and combination of its part this splendid comparison of hum depend on know how a stone arch work for help with that go to httpwwwtechnologystudentcomstructarchhtm all the laws of nature that regulate property as well as all civil laws that do so be general they fix on certain essential circumstances of the case and ignore the character situations and interrelations of the people concern as well as any particular consequences that may result from apply these laws in any particular case that come up if a beneficent man have acquire all his possessions through a mistake and without have a good legal title to them these laws dont hesitate to make him pass the whole lot over to the man who be legally entitle to them even if he be a selfish miser who have already heap up immense store of superfluous riches the interest of society as a whole require that property should be regulate by inflexible general rule the rule that be adopt be the ones that best serve the end of public utility but its impossible for them to prevent all particular hardships or make beneficial consequences result from every individual application of a rule it be sufficient if the whole plan or scheme be necessary for the support of civil society and if the overall good greatly outweigh the bad aspects of particular case dont think it would have be easy to devise rule that didnt work badly in special case even the general laws of the universe though plan by gods infinite wisdom cant exclude all evil or inconvenience from some particular events some have maintain that justice arise from human conventions and depend on the voluntary choice consent or workingtogether of mankind if in this context convention mean what be usually mean namely a promise nothing could be more absurd than this thesis the keep of promise be itself a considerable part of justicesurely we arent bind to keep our word because we have give our word to keep it but if on the other hand convention be be use here to refer to a sense of common interest that each man feel in himself and notice in his fellowmen as well a sense that carry him and them into a general plan of action that have public utility as a consequence then i have to agree that justice do arise from human conventions in this sense give the obvious fact that the particular consequences of a particular act of justice may be harmful not only to some individuals but to the public in general it follow that anyone who aim always to act justly must have an eye to the whole plan or system and must expect his fellowhumans to act in the same way in the same circumstances if he take into account nothing but the consequences of each individual act of his own his benevolence and humanityas well as his selflovemight often have him behave in ways very different from what the strict rule of right and justice prescribe thus two men pull the oars of a boat by common convention for common interest without any promise or contract thus gold and silver be make the measure of exchange thus speech and word and language be fix by human convention and agreement when two or more people behave in a way that be advantageous to all of them if they all perform their part in it but lose all advantage if only one perform their conduct must arise from a convention in the second of the above sense theres no other possible source for it no other motive for any one of them to participate in that scheme of conduct this theory about the origin of property and thus the origin of justice be pretty much the same as one hint at and adopt by grotius in his laws of war and peace hume quote at some length from this latin work the passage doesnt add any philosophical content to what be already before us the word natural be take in so many sense and be so loose in its mean that it seem pointless to argue about whether justice be natural if these be natural to man selflove benevolence reason forethought then we can also describe justice order fidelity property society as natural too mens want and need lead them to combine and their understand and experience tell them that this combination wont work if each man govern himself by no rule and isnt affect by the think that this or that thing belong to someone else and from these passions and reflections take together as soon as we observe similar passions and reflections in other people the sentiment of justice inevitably come to have some place large or small in the makeup of every individual of the human species thats what have happen down through the centuries in as intelligent an animal as man anything that necessarily arise from the use of his intellectual faculties can fairly be regard as natural among all civilize nations there have be a constant attempt to separate the institution of property from every kind of bias and favouritism and to base legal decisions about property on general view and considerations that apply equally to every member of society there be at least two reason for this nothing could be more dangerous than for judge to be accustom to allow their decisions to reflecthowever slightlytheir own private friendship or enmity if men think that the only reason why they lose a legal case be the judge personal bias they would be apt to become extremely hostile to the whole legal system that be why in case where natural reason doesnt yield any fix view of public utility that could settle a controversy about property manmade laws be often create to do what natural reason doesnt do and to govern procedure of all court of law quite often manmade laws dont do the job either and then precedents be call for and an earlier decisioneven one for which there be no sufficient reasonis rightly treat as a sufficient reason for a new decision when direct laws and precedents fail imperfect and indirect reason be bring to the rescue and the case in dispute be bring under them by analogical reason and comparisons liken and correspondences which be often more fanciful than real it be pretty safe to say that general jurisprudence usually legal theory but here probably legal practice be unlike all the sciences in this respect and that in many of its more finegrained question there cant properly be say to be truth or falsehood on either side natural can be oppose to unusual to miraculous or to artificial in the first two of those sense justice and property be undoubtedly natural perhaps they cant strictly be call natural in the third senseie mean not artificialbecause justice and property do presuppose reason forethought and design which mean that they be really artificial if men hadnt live in society property would never have be know and neither justice nor injustice would have exist but society among human creatures would have be impossible without reason and forethought lower animals that unite into something like societies be guide by instinct which serve them in place of reason but all these dispute be merely verbal if one pleader bring the case under some earlier law or precedent by mean of a refine analogy or comparison his opponent wont be at a loss to find an analogy or comparison that go the opposite way and the judge choice between these be often base more on taste and imagination than on any solid argument the general objective of all court of law be public utility and this also require a stable rule in all controversies but when there be an impasse create by several equally plausible rule some very slight turn of think settle the decision in favour of one of the party star t of a very long footnote the origin of justice and property be societys absolute need for some steady and constant scheme under which individual people possess things it usually doesnt matter much what possessions be assign to this or that person and rule govern that though they be to be strictly adhere to be often base on very frivolous view and considerations here be five examples of relatively specialise propertyrules in the last two of which our imagination be at work in ways that could fairly be call frivolous if a number of independent people come together to form a society the most obvious rule for them to agree on as a basis for property would be that everyone be to have a right of possession in any property that he own or have the use of now a persons become in this way the legal owner of something x would be base on a real relation that already exist between himself and x for a similar reason someones have be the first to occupy or use something be treat as a basis for his have it as his property this differ from only in not be tie to the imagine situation in which the society and its laws be be devise so it still have s feature of be base on an antecedent real relation between the person and the property when a man put work in on something that previously didnt belong to anyoneeg cut down and shape a tree cultivate a field or the likethe alterations he produce cause one relation between him and the object and this naturally draw us into establish a second relation between them by rule that the object be his legal property there be also a publicutility reason for this rule namely that it encourage hard work those be two reason for rule that labour create property in the manner i have describe there may be a third perhaps private humanity towards the man join in with the other two reason and make us want to leave him in possession of something that he have acquire by his sweat and labour something that he have think and hop he could go on use private humanity certainly cant be the origin of justice because justice often go against it but when societys need have establish rule of property some rule may arise from private humanity and reluctance to bring hardship upon someone im much incline to think that the right of inheritance depend greatly on connections of the imagination and that the reason why property be transfer to a man after the death of his father say be the fairly frivolous think that the man relation to his father somehow give birth to a relation between him and the property its true that hard work be more encourage by the transference of ownership to children or near relatives but this have force only in develop societies whereas the right of inheritance be recognize even among the greatest barbarians acquisition of property by accession can only be explain in term of the relations and connections of the imaginations accession law artificial improvement or natural growth of a property shorter oed to explain this i need first to say something about the ownership of rivers the laws of most nations and the natural turn of our thoughts dictate that rivers be own by the owners of their bank except for such vast rivers as the rhine or the danube which seem too wide to come to be own through ownership of the neighbour field but even these big rivers be regard as belong to the nation through whose territory they run because we think of a nation as be big enough to match up to such rivers in our imagination civil laws say that the accession that be make to land border upon rivers follow the land ie be own by the owners of the land provide that the accession be make very gradually and imperceptibly by the rivers deposit of silt or the like this gradualness help the imagination to tie the new land to the old land when a considerable portion of land be suddenly wash away from one bank and sweep across to the other it become the property of the person who own the land on that other side after it have unite with his land and the tree and plant have spread their root into both his old land and this new bite after that and not before it be only after that unite by soil and root that our thoughtstrictly speak our imaginationsufficiently join them in short we must always distinguish the need for a system of permanent propertyrights from the rule that determine who own what the need be obvious strong and invincible the specific rule may depend on lighter and less serious view about public utility on the sentiment of private humanity and aversion to bring hardship on people on manmade laws on precedents analogies and very fine connections and turn of the imagination end of the very long footnote before leave this subject i should remark that after the laws of justice have be fix by considerations of general utility we pay a great deal of attention to the harm that come to individuals through any violation of those laws such individual harm play a large part in how strongly we blame an unjust action by the laws of society this coat or this horse be mine and ought to stay in my possession im rely on be able to go on enjoy it and when you take it from me you disappoint my expectations and doubly displease me and offend every bystander it be a public wrong because it violate the general rule of ownership and it be a private harm because in it an individual be injure the private consideration wouldnt have any place in this if the laws violate by the public wrong hadnt first be establish for without those laws the distinction between mine and thine wouldnt be know in society but unquestionably our concern for general good be intensify by our concern for particular good something that harm the community without harm any individual be often more lightly think of but when the greatest public wrong also involve a considerable private wrong its not surprise that the highest disapproval attend such wicked behaviour appendix some verbal dispute nothing be more usual than for philosophers to trespass on the territory of grammarians and engage in dispute about word while think they be handle controversies of the deepest importance and concern i be try to keep out of frivolous and endless arguments of that sort when i use the utmost caution in state the objective of my present enquiry and set out simply to collect a list of the mental qualities that be the object of love or esteem and form a part of personal merit and a catalogue of the qualities that be the object of censure or reproach and detract from the character of the person who have them add some thoughts about the origins of these sentiments of praise or blame i avoid the term virtue and vice on every occasion when there might be some difficulty about themdifficulty arise from the fact that some of the qualities on my first list be usually call talents rather than virtues and that some of the items on my second list be often call defect rather than vices you might expect me now before end this moral enquiry to draw sharp line between virtues and talents and between vices and defect and to explain the rationales and the origins of those line well i be not go to an exploration of those line would end up be a merely grammatical enquiry but i shall offer four reflections which will contain all that i intend to say on this subject i dont find that in english or any other modern language the boundaries be exactly fix between virtues and talents vices and defect or that a precise definition can be give of the one as distinguish from the other we might try this the only admirable qualities that count as virtues be ones that be voluntary but think about such qualities as courage equanimity patience selfcontrol which almost every language classify as virtues although they depend little if at all on our choice or we might try this its only the qualities that prompt us to act our part in society that be entitle to be call virtues those be indeed the most valuable qualities but they be commonly call the social virtues and that adjective presuppose that some virtues be not social a third try intellectual endowments dont count as virtues only moral endowments do because they be the only ones that lead to action but many of the qualities that be usually call intellectual virtueseg prudence penetration discernment discretionalso have a considerable influence on conduct or we might try this qualities of the heartmeaning ones the exercise of which be accompany by a feel or sentimentare the genuine virtues whereas qualities of the head be not but that wont do either because industry frugality temperance perseverance and many other praiseworthy power or habit be generally call virtues and the exercise of them doesnt involve any immediate sentiment in the person concern in the middle of this welter of suggestions and refutations it be fortunate that the question cant possibly be of any importance because it be purely verbal a moral and philosophical discourse neednt enter into all these whims of language which be so variable in different dialects and even in the same dialect at different time still ill offer a view about the matter it seem to me that although everyone agree that there be virtues of many different kinds what we chiefly have in mind when we call a man virtuous or a man of virtue be his social qualities which be indeed the most valuable all the same an honest goodnatured man wouldnt get that honourable label if he be notably lack in any of the nonsocial virtues such as courage temperance economy industry understand dignity of mind who would ever say except as a joke he be a man of great virtue but a complete blockhead its not surprise that languages arent very precise in mark off virtues from talents and vices from defect because how we feel about them be not very different the sentiment of conscious worth the selfsatisfaction that come from a review of ones own conduct and character arise from the endowments of courage and ability industry and ingenuity as well as from other mental excellences and on the other side who isnt deeply embarrass when he think back on his own folly and clumsiness of behaviour feel a secret sting whenever his memory bring back any past episode in which he behave with stupidity or bad manners time never erase the cruel ideas that a man have of his own foolish conduct or of hostility he have bring on himself through his own cowardice or impudence they still haunt his solitary hours damp his most aspire thoughts and show him even to himself in the most contemptible and odious colour imaginable what be we more anxious to conceal from others and not have expose by jeer and satire than such blunder infirmities and meannesses and what be we chiefly vain about isnt it our bravery or learn our wit or breed our eloquence or skill in speak our taste or abilities we display these with care if not with ostentation and we commonly show more ambition to excel in them than even in the social virtues themselves though the social virtues be really of much greater excellence goodnature and especially honesty be so indispensably require for society that although any violation of these duties hum word bring the greatest blame no special praise be give to common instance of them of the sort that seem essential for the support of human society that i think be why although men be often very free in praise the qualities of their heart they be shy about commend the endowments of their head because the virtues of the head be think to be more rare and extraordinary be experience as more usual object of pride and selfconceit so that when someone boast of have them we strongly suspect that pride and selfconceit be at work in him its hard to tell whether you hurt a man character more by call him a knave or by call him a coward or to tell whether a beastly glutton or drunkard be as odious and contemptible as a meanly selfish miser suppose i could choose my characterspecifically choose between have a friendly humane heart and extensive genius and courage and all the other virtues of demosthenes and philip combine for my own happiness and selfsatisfaction i would choose but for the worlds view of me i would choose expect to get much more general applause and admiration from that than from the figure that a man cut in life the reception he meet with in company the admiration he get from those who know himall these advantage depend as much on his good sense and judgment as on any other part of his character a man who have the best intentions in the world and be utterly remove from all injustice and violence still wont get much respect from the world unless he have at least a moderate share of intellectual competence so what be there here for us to dispute about if sense and courage temperance and industry wisdom and knowledge be agree to form a considerable part of personal merit if a man who have those qualities be better satisfy with himself and better entitle to the goodwill respect and cooperation of others than be anyone who entirely lack them if in short these endowments arouse similar sentiments to those arouse by the social virtues be there any reason for us to be so extremely scrupulous about a word or to argue about whether they be entitle to the label virtues it may be claim that the sentiment of approval produce by the accomplishments as well as be inferior to the sentiment that greet the virtues of justice and humanity be also somewhat different from it but this doesnt seem to be a sufficient reason for classify the two quite differently and give them different label within the class of characteristics that be uncontroversially class as virtues there be considerable differences in the sentiments that they produce in others the historian sallust describe the character of caesar and of cato in a way that qualify each to count as virtuous in the strictest and tightest sense of the word but their ways of be virtuous be different and the sentiments they arouse in us be also somewhat different caesar produce love cato produce admiration caesar be amiable cato be aweinspiring we would like our friends to resemble caesar but our ambition for ourselves would be to resemble cato similarly the approval we give to temperance or industry or frugality may be somewhat different from our approval of the social virtuesbut not so different as to make them completely different species of approval i believe that most people will naturally and unhesitatingly agree with what an elegant and judicious poet write virtue for mere goodnature be a fool be sense and spirit with humanity what claim do a man have to our generous assistance if he have dissipate his wealth in luxurious expense idle vanities fatuous project dissolute pleasures or extravagant gamble these vices i do call them vices bring unpitied misery and contempt on everyone who be addict to them achaeus a wise and prudent prince fell into a trap that cost him his crown and his life after he have use every reasonable precaution to guard himself against it on that account say the historian polybius he deserve both respect and compassion only those who betray him merit hatred and contempt pompeys sudden flight and rash negligence at the start of the civil war strike cicero as such notorious blunder that they wipe out his friendship towards that great man he compare the effect on him of this behaviour of pompeys with the way we would be affect by lack of cleanliness or decency or discretion in a mistress thats how cicero put it when speak in his role not as a philosopher but as a statesman and man of the world but when this same cicero be think like a philosopher he follow all the ancient moralists in present a very broad idea of virtue give that honourable label to every praiseworthy quality or endowment of the mind this lead me to hume have a longish footnote about differences in emotional response to various charactertraits focus mainly on love and admiration he throw in another example there seem to be a stronger mixture of pride in contempt than of humility in admiration and it wouldnt be hard to work out why if one make a careful study of all the passions all these various mixtures and compositions and appearances of sentiment make a challenge subject of theoretical investigation but they arent relevant to my present topic throughout the present enquiry i have always consider in a general way what qualities be praise or blame without go into all the minute differences of sentiment that they arouse the ancient moralists the best model attach little weight to any differences among the different kinds of mental endowments and defect treat them all alike as virtues or vices and bring them all within the scope of their moral reason in the classification adopt by that eloquent moralist cicero our social duties constitute merely one of four main kinds of virtue at this point hume have a footnote quote in latin a passage by cicero which he say clearly and explicitly make his hum point the ancient moralists the best model attach little weight to any differences among the different kinds of mental endowments and defect treat them all alike as virtues or vices and bring them all within the scope of their moral reason in the classification adopt by that eloquent moralist cicero our social duties constitute merely one of four main kinds of virtue at this point hume have a footnote quote in latin a passage by cicero which he say clearly and explicitly make his hum point we need only glance through the chaptertitles in aristotles ethical work to be convince that he take the virtues to include not only justice and friendship but also courage temperance magnificence magnanimity modesty prudence and manly openness for some of the ancients all morality be sum up in sustain and abstain ie be patient and continent thats a morality that tell us to put up with the blow that fate land on us and to refrain from various kinds of misconduct hum point presumably be that such a morality be notably distant from emphasize virtue in anything like his or our sense of the word epictetus hardly ever mention the sentiment of humanity and compassion except to warn his disciples against it the virtue of the stoics seem to consist mainly in a firm temperament and a good intellect with them as with solomon and the eastern moralists folly and wisdom be equivalent to vice and virtue respectively men will praise thee say david when thou dost well unto thyself psalm the greek poet euripedes say i hate a wise man who isnt wise to himself plutarch doesnt let systems of morality cramp his style in his philosophy any more than in his history when he compare the great men of greece and rome he set out all their blemish and accomplishments of whatever kind include everything significant that could either lower or raise their moral stand his moral discourse contain the same free and natural censure of men and manners livys description of the character of hannibal be regard as bias but it do allow him many eminent virtues accord to livy before hannibal there have never be anyone as well equip as he be for both of his opposite rolescommanding and obeyingso that it would be hard to decide whether he be value more by the general whom he obey or by the army which he command there be noone to whom the general hasdrubal would more willingly entrust the conduct of any dangerous enterprise and noone under whom the soldier reveal more courage and confidence great boldness in face danger great prudence in the midst of it no labour could fatigue his body or subdue his mind cold and heat mean nothing to him food and drink he seek as something need to keep him alive not as gratifications of luxurious appetites wake or rest he use indiscriminately by night or by day these great virtues be balance by great vicesinhuman cruelty treacherousness that be extreme even for a carthaginian no truth no faith no respect for oaths or promise or religion the character of pope alexander vi as draw by the historian guicciardini be pretty similar but less bias and it show that even the moderns when they speak naturally use the same moral language as the ancients this pope say the historian have a singular capacity and judgment admirable prudence a wonderful talent for persuasion and in any important enterprise incredible diligence and dexterity but these virtues be infinitely outweigh by his vicesno faith no religion insatiable greed extravagant ambition and more than barbarous cruelty polybius regard the sicilian leader agathocles as the most cruel and impious of all tyrants but he still rebuke timaeus for give such a onesidedly negative account of him from timaeus himself polybius say we learn this about agathocles he take refuge in syracuse flee the dirt and smoke and toil of his former profession as a potter from such humble beginnings he rise quite quickly to be the master of all sicily he put the carthaginian state in the utmost danger and he die as an old man in possession of sovereign dignity if all that be right say polybius shouldnt it be grant that there be something prodigious and extraordinary about him and that he have great talents and capacity for business and action his historian oughtnt have record only what tend to his reproach and infamy but also what might redound to his praise and honour we may notice that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary wasnt attend to much by the ancients in their moral reason as witness the fact that they often treat the question can virtue be teach as genuinely open hume refer to plato seneca horace and one other writer then they rightly think that cowardice meanness frivolity anxiety impatience folly and many other qualities of the mind might appear ridiculous and deform contemptible and odious even though they be independent of the will and it couldnt be suppose that everyone always have the power to attain every kind of mental excellence any more than the power to become physically beautiful why in their moral enquiries have modern philosophers often follow such a different course from that of the ancients in later time philosophy of all kinds and especially ethics have be more closely unite with theology than be ever the case with the heathens and that have make a big difference because theology wont bargain or compromise but bend every branch of knowledge to its own purpose without much regard to the phenomena of nature or to the unbiassed sentiments of the mind because of this intransigence reason and even language have be warp from their natural course and people have try to establish verbal distinctions where the difference in the object be virtually imperceptible philosophers or rather theologians disguise as philosophers have treat all morals as on a par with civil laws guard by the sanction of reward and punishment and this have inevitably lead them to put the voluntaryinvoluntary distinction at the foundation of their whole theory well anyone may use word in whatever sense he like but they ought to concede that people often have sentiments of blame and praise that they direct at items that dont fall within the scope of will or choice and that we oughtif not as moralists then as theoretical philosophersto give some
